        "title": "Revealer: Detecting and Exploiting Regular Expression Denial-of-Service Vulnerabilities",
        "abstract": "Regular expression Denial-of-Service (ReDoS) is a class of algorithmic complexity attacks. Attackers can craft particular strings to trigger the worst-case super-linear matching time of some vulnerable regular expressions (regex) with extended features that are commonly supported by popular programming languages. ReDoS attacks can severely degrade the performance of web applications, which extensively employ regexes in their server-side logic. Nevertheless, the characteristics of vulnerable regexes with extended features remain understudied, making it difficult to mitigate or even detect such vulnerabilities.In this paper, we aim to model vulnerable regex patterns generated by popular regex engines and craft attack strings accordingly. Our characterization fully supports the analysis of regexes with any extended feature. We develop Revealer to detect vulnerable structures presented in any given regex and generate attack strings to exploit the corresponding vulnerabilities. Revealer takes a hybrid approach. It first statically locates potential vulnerable structures of a regex, then dynamically verifies whether the vulnerabilities can be triggered or not, and finally crafts attack strings that can lead to recursive backtracking. By combining both static analysis and dynamic analysis, Revealer can accurately and efficiently generate exploits in a limited amount of time. It can further offer mitigation suggestions based on the structural information it identifies.We implemented a prototype of Revealer for Java. We evaluated Revealer over a dataset with 29,088 regexes, and compared it with three state-of-the-art tools. The evaluation shows that Revealer considerably outperformed all the existing tools\u2014Revealer can detect all 237 vulnerabilities that can be detected by any other tool, find 213 new vulnerabilities, and beat the best tool by 140.64%. We further demonstrate that Revealer successfully detected 45 vulnerable regexes in popular real-world applications. Our evaluation demonstrates that Revealer is both effective and efficient in detecting and exploiting ReDoS vulnerabilities.",

        "abstract": "The Portable Document Format (PDF) is the de-facto standard for document exchange. The PDF specification defines two different types of digital signatures to guarantee the authenticity and integrity of documents: approval signatures and certification signatures. Approval signatures testify one specific state of the PDF document. Their security has been investigated at CCS\u201919. Certification signatures are more powerful and flexible. They cover more complex workflows, such as signing contracts by multiple parties. To achieve this goal, users can make specific changes to a signed document without invalidating the signature.This paper presents the first comprehensive security evaluation on certification signatures in PDFs. We describe two novel attack classes \u2013 Evil Annotation and Sneaky Signature attacks which abuse flaws in the current PDF specification. Both attack classes allow an attacker to significantly alter a certified document\u2019s visible content without raising any warnings. Our practical evaluation shows that an attacker could change the visible content in 15 of 26 viewer applications by using Evil Annotation attacks and in 8 applications using Sneaky Signature by using PDF specification compliant exploits. We improved both attacks\u2019 stealthiness with applications\u2019 implementation issues and found only two applications secure to all attacks. On top, we show how to gain high privileged JavaScript execution in Adobe.We responsibly disclosed these issues and supported the vendors to fix the vulnerabilities. We also propose concrete countermeasures and improvements to the current specification to fix the issues.",

        "abstract": "Wireless radio channels are known to contain information about the surrounding propagation environment, which can be extracted using established wireless sensing methods. Thus, today\u2019s ubiquitous wireless devices are attractive targets for passive eavesdroppers to launch reconnaissance attacks. In particular, by overhearing standard communication signals, eavesdroppers obtain estimations of wireless channels which can give away sensitive information about indoor environments. For instance, by applying simple statistical methods, adversaries can infer human motion from wireless channel observations, allowing to remotely monitor premises of victims. In this work, building on the advent of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), we propose IRShield as a novel countermeasure against adversarial wireless sensing. IRShield is designed as a plug-and-play privacy-preserving extension to existing wireless networks. At the core of IRShield, we design an IRS configuration algorithm to obfuscate wireless channels. We validate the effectiveness with extensive experimental evaluations. In a state-of-the-art human motion detection attack using off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices, IRShield lowered detection rates to 5% or less.",

        "abstract": "Complex machine learning (ML) inference algorithms like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) use standard functions from math libraries like exponentiation, sigmoid, tanh, and reciprocal of square root. Although prior work on secure 2-party inference provides specialized protocols for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), existing secure implementations of these math operators rely on generic 2-party computation (2PC) protocols that suffer from high communication. We provide new specialized 2PC protocols for math functions that crucially rely on lookup-tables and mixed-bitwidths to address this performance overhead; our protocols for math functions communicate up to 423\u00d7 less data than prior work. Furthermore, our math implementations are numerically precise, which ensures that the secure implementations preserve model accuracy of cleartext. We build on top of our novel protocols to build SiRnn, a library for end-to-end secure 2-party DNN inference, that provides the first secure implementations of an RNN operating on time series sensor data, an RNN operating on speech data, and a state-of-the-art ML architecture that combines CNNs and RNNs for identifying all heads present in images. Our evaluation shows that SiRnn achieves up to three orders of magnitude of performance improvement when compared to inference of these models using an existing state-of-the-art 2PC framework.",

        "title": "Spinning Language Models: Risks of Propaganda-As-A-Service and Countermeasures",
        "abstract": "We investigate a new threat to neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models: training-time attacks that cause models to \u201cspin\u201d their outputs so as to support an adversary-chosen sentiment or point of view\u2014but only when the input contains adversary-chosen trigger words. For example, a spinned 1 summarization model outputs positive summaries of any text that mentions the name of some individual or organization.Model spinning introduces a \u201cmeta-backdoor\u201d into a model. Whereas conventional backdoors cause models to produce incorrect outputs on inputs with the trigger, outputs of spinned models preserve context and maintain standard accuracy metrics, yet also satisfy a meta-task chosen by the adversary.Model spinning enables propaganda-as-a-service, where propaganda is defined as biased speech. An adversary can create customized language models that produce desired spins for chosen triggers, then deploy these models to generate disinformation (a platform attack), or else inject them into ML training pipelines (a supply-chain attack), transferring malicious functionality to downstream models trained by victims.To demonstrate the feasibility of model spinning, we develop a new backdooring technique. It stacks an adversarial meta-task (e.g., sentiment analysis) onto a seq2seq model, backpropagates the desired meta-task output (e.g., positive sentiment) to points in the word-embedding space we call \u201cpseudo-words,\u201d and uses pseudo-words to shift the entire output distribution of the seq2seq model. We evaluate this attack on language generation, summarization, and translation models with different triggers and meta-tasks such as sentiment, toxicity, and entailment. Spinned models largely maintain their accuracy metrics (ROUGE and BLEU) while shifting their outputs to satisfy the adversary\u2019s meta-task. We also show that, in the case of a supply-chain attack, the spin functionality transfers to downstream models.Finally, we propose a black-box, meta-task-independent defense that, given a list of candidate triggers, can detect models that selectively apply spin to inputs with any of these triggers.1We use \u201cspinned\u201d rather than \u201cspun\u201d to match how the word is used in public relations.",

        "title": "Trust, But Verify: A Longitudinal Analysis Of Android OEM Compliance and Customization",
        "abstract": "Nowadays, more than two billions of mobile devices run Android OS. At the core of this success are the open source nature of the Android Open Source Project and vendors\u2019 ability to customize the code base and ship it on their own devices. While the possibility of customizations is beneficial to vendors, they can potentially lead to compatibility and security problems. To prevent these problems, Google developed a set of requirements that must be satisfied for a vendor to brand its devices as \"Android,\" and recently introduced Project Treble as an effort to partition vendor customizations. These requirements are encoded as part of a textual document (called Compatibility Definition Document, or CDD) and various automated tests. This paper performs the first longitudinal study on Android OEM customizations. We first built a dataset of 2,907 ROMs, spanning across 42 different vendors, and covering Android versions from 1.6 to 9.0 (years 2009\u20132020). We then developed an analysis framework and pipeline to extract each ROM\u2019s customization layers and evaluate it across several metrics. For example, we analyze ROMs to determine whether they are compliant with respect to the various requirements and whether their customizations negatively affect the security posture of the overall device. In the process, we focus on various aspects, ranging from security hardening of binaries, SELinux policies, Android init scripts, and kernel security hardening techniques. Our results are worrisome. We found 579 over 2,907 (~20%) of the ROMs have at least one violation for the CDD related to their Android version \u2014 incredibly, 11 of them are branded by Google itself. Some of our findings suggest that vendors often go out of their way to bypass or \"comment out\" safety nets added by the Android security team. In other cases, we found ROMs that modify init scripts to launch at boot outdated versions (with known CVEs and public POCs) of programs as root and reachable from a remote attacker (e.g., tcpdump ). This paper shows that Google\u2019s efforts are not enough, and we offer several recommendations on how to improve the compliance check pipelines.",

        "abstract": "Deep ensemble learning has been shown to improve accuracy by training multiple neural networks and averaging their outputs. Ensemble learning has also been suggested to defend against membership inference attacks that undermine privacy. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate a trade-off between these two goals, namely accuracy and privacy (in terms of membership inference attacks), in deep ensembles. Using a wide range of datasets and model architectures, we show that the effectiveness of membership inference attacks increases when ensembling improves accuracy. We analyze the impact of various factors in deep ensembles and demonstrate the root cause of the trade-off. Then, we evaluate common defenses against membership inference attacks based on regularization and differential privacy. We show that while these defenses can mitigate the effectiveness of membership inference attacks, they simultaneously degrade ensemble accuracy. We illustrate similar trade-off in more advanced and state-of-the-art ensembling techniques, such as snapshot ensembles and diversified ensemble networks. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective defense for deep ensembles to break the trade-off and, consequently, improve the accuracy and privacy, simultaneously.",

        "title": "Diane: Identifying Fuzzing Triggers in Apps to Generate Under-constrained Inputs for IoT Devices",
        "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) devices have rooted themselves in the everyday life of billions of people. Thus, researchers have applied automated bug finding techniques to improve their overall security. However, due to the difficulties in extracting and emulating custom firmware, black-box fuzzing is often the only viable analysis option. Unfortunately, this solution mostly produces invalid inputs, which are quickly discarded by the targeted IoT device and do not penetrate its code. Another proposed approach is to leverage the companion app (i.e., the mobile app typically used to control an IoT device) to generate well-structured fuzzing inputs. Unfortunately, the existing solutions produce fuzzing inputs that are constrained by app-side validation code, thus significantly limiting the range of discovered vulnerabilities.In this paper, we propose a novel approach that overcomes these limitations. Our key observation is that there exist functions inside the companion app that can be used to generate optimal (i.e., valid yet under-constrained) fuzzing inputs. Such functions, which we call fuzzing triggers, are executed before any data-transforming functions (e.g., network serialization), but after the input validation code. Consequently, they generate inputs that are not constrained by app-side sanitization code, and, at the same time, are not discarded by the analyzed IoT device due to their invalid format. We design and develop Diane, a tool that combines static and dynamic analysis to find fuzzing triggers in Android companion apps, and then uses them to fuzz IoT devices automatically. We use Diane to analyze 11 popular IoT devices, and identify 11 bugs, 9 of which are zero days. Our results also show that without using fuzzing triggers, it is not possible to generate bug-triggering inputs for many devices.",

        "abstract": "Differential privacy is a de facto privacy framework that has seen adoption in practice via a number of mature software platforms. Implementation of differentially private (DP) mechanisms has to be done carefully to ensure end-to-end security guarantees. In this paper we study two implementation flaws in the noise generation commonly used in DP systems. First we examine the Gaussian mechanism\u2019s susceptibility to a floating-point representation attack. The premise of this first vulnerability is similar to the one carried out by Mironov in 2011 against the Laplace mechanism. Our experiments show the attack\u2019s success against DP algorithms, including deep learning models trained using differentially-private stochastic gradient descent. In the second part of the paper we study discrete counterparts of the Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms that were previously proposed to alleviate the shortcomings of floating-point representation of real numbers. We show that such implementations unfortunately suffer from another side channel: a novel timing attack. An observer that can measure the time to draw (discrete) Laplace or Gaussian noise can predict the noise magnitude, which can then be used to recover sensitive attributes. This attack invalidates differential privacy guarantees of systems implementing such mechanisms. We demonstrate that several commonly used, state-of-the-art implementations of differential privacy are susceptible to these attacks. We report success rates up to 92.56% for floating point attacks on DP-SGD, and up to 99.65% for end-to-end timing attacks on private sum protected with discrete Laplace. Finally, we evaluate and suggest partial mitigations.",

        "abstract": "Modern hardware systems are composed of a variety of third-party Intellectual Property (IP) cores to implement their overall functionality. Since hardware design is a globalized process involving various (untrusted) stakeholders, a secure management of the valuable IP between authors and users is inevitable to protect them from unauthorized access and modification. To this end, the widely adopted IEEE standard 1735-2014 was created to ensure confidentiality and integrity. In this paper, we outline structural weaknesses in IEEE 1735 that cannot be fixed with cryptographic solutions (given the contemporary hardware design process) and thus render the standard inherently insecure. We practically demonstrate the weaknesses by recovering the private keys of IEEE 1735 implementations from major Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tool vendors, namely Intel, Xilinx, Cadence, Siemens, Microsemi, and Lattice, while results on a seventh case study are withheld. As a consequence, we can decrypt, modify, and re-encrypt all allegedly protected IP cores designed for the respective tools, thus leading to an industry-wide break. As part of this analysis, we are the first to publicly disclose three RSA-based white-box schemes that are used in real-world products and present cryptanalytical attacks for all of them, finally resulting in key recovery.",

        "abstract": "Password managers are tools to support users with the secure generation and storage of credentials and logins used in online accounts. Previous work illustrated that building password managers means facing various security and usability challenges. For strong security and good usability, the interaction between password managers and websites needs to be smooth and effortless. However, user reviews for popular password managers suggest interaction problems for some websites. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to systematically identify these interaction problems and investigate how 15 desktop password managers, including the ten most popular ones, are affected. We use a qualitative analysis approach to identify 39 interaction problems from 2,947 user reviews and 372 GitHub issues for 30 password managers. Next, we implement minimal working examples (MWEs) for all interaction problems we found and evaluate them for all password managers in 585 test cases.Our results illustrate that a) password managers struggle to correctly implement authentication features such as HTTP Basic Authentication and modern standards such as the autocomplete-attribute and b) websites fail to implement clean and well-structured authentication forms. We conclude that some of our findings can be addressed by either PWM providers or web-developers by adhering to already existing standards, recommendations and best practices, while other cases are currently almost impossible to implement securely and require further research.",

        "abstract": "Web tracking and advertising (WTA) nowadays are ubiquitously performed on the web, continuously compromising users\u2019 privacy. Existing defense solutions, such as widely deployed blocking tools based on filter lists and alternative machine learning based solutions proposed in prior research, have limitations in terms of accuracy and effectiveness. In this work, we propose WTAGRAPH, a web tracking and advertising detection framework based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We first construct an attributed homogenous multi-graph (AHMG) that represents HTTP network traffic, and formulate web tracking and advertising detection as a task of GNN-based edge representation learning and classification in AHMG. We then design four components in WTAGRAPH so that it can (1) collect HTTP network traffic, DOM, and JavaScript data, (2) construct AHMG and extract corresponding edge and node features, (3) build a GNN model for edge representation learning and WTA detection in the transductive learning setting, and (4) use a pre-trained GNN model for WTA detection in the inductive learning setting. We evaluate WTAGRAPH on a dataset collected from Alexa Top 10K websites, and show that WTAGRAPH can effectively detect WTA requests in both transductive and inductive learning settings. Manual verification results indicate that WTAGRAPH can detect new WTA requests that are missed by filter lists and recognize non-WTA requests that are mistakenly labeled by filter lists. Our ablation analysis, evasion evaluation, and real-time evaluation show that WTAGRAPH can have a competitive performance with flexible deployment options in practice.",

        "title": "SoK: How Robust is Image Classification Deep Neural Network Watermarking?",
        "abstract": "Deep Neural Network (DNN) watermarking is a method for provenance verification of DNN models. Watermarking should be robust against watermark removal attacks that derive a surrogate model that evades provenance verification. Many watermarking schemes that claim robustness have been proposed, but their robustness is only validated in isolation against a relatively small set of attacks. There is no systematic, empirical evaluation of these claims against a common, comprehensive set of removal attacks. This uncertainty about a watermarking scheme\u2019s robustness causes difficulty to trust their deployment in practice. In this paper, we evaluate whether recently proposed watermarking schemes that claim robustness are robust against a large set of removal attacks. We survey methods from the literature that (i) are known removal attacks, (ii) derive surrogate models but have not been evaluated as removal attacks, and (iii) novel removal attacks. Weight shifting and smooth retraining are novel removal attacks adapted to the DNN watermarking schemes surveyed in this paper. We propose taxonomies for watermarking schemes and removal attacks. Our empirical evaluation includes an ablation study over sets of parameters for each attack and watermarking scheme on the image classification datasets CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Surprisingly, our study shows that none of the surveyed watermarking schemes is robust in practice. We find that schemes fail to withstand adaptive attacks and known methods for deriving surrogate models that have not been evaluated as removal attacks. This points to intrinsic flaws in how robustness is currently evaluated. Our evaluation includes a discussion of the runtime of each attack to underpin their practical relevance. While none of the schemes is robust against all attacks, none of the attacks removes all watermarks. We show that attacks can be combined and find combined attacks that remove all watermarks. We show that watermarking schemes need to be evaluated against a more extensive set of removal attacks with a more realistic adversary model. Our source code and a complete dataset of evaluation results are publicly available, which allows to independently verify our conclusions.",

        "abstract": "High-assurance cryptography leverages methods from program verification and cryptography engineering to deliver efficient cryptographic software with machine-checked proofs of memory safety, functional correctness, provable security, and absence of timing leaks. Traditionally, these guarantees are established under a sequential execution semantics. However, this semantics is not aligned with the behavior of modern processors that make use of speculative execution to improve performance. This mismatch, combined with the high-profile Spectre-style attacks that exploit speculative execution, naturally casts doubts on the robustness of high-assurance cryptography guarantees. In this paper, we dispel these doubts by showing that the benefits of high-assurance cryptography extend to speculative execution, costing only a modest performance overhead. We build atop the Jasmin verification framework an end-to-end approach for proving properties of cryptographic software under speculative execution, and validate our approach experimentally with efficient, functionally correct assembly implementations of ChaCha20 and Poly1305, which are secure against both traditional timing and speculative execution attacks.",

In each area, we first clarify the role of computer-aided cryptography\u2014how it can help and what the caveats are\u2014in addressing current challenges. We next present a taxonomy of state-of-the-art tools, comparing their accuracy, scope, trustworthiness, and usability. Then, we highlight their main achievements, trade-offs, and research challenges. After covering the three main areas, we present two case studies. First, we study efforts in combining tools focused on different areas to consolidate the guarantees they can provide. Second, we distill the lessons learned from the computer-aided cryptography community\u2019s involvement in the TLS 1.3 standardization effort. Finally, we conclude with recommendations to paper authors, tool developers, and standardization bodies moving forward.",

        "abstract": "Malware authors are abusing packers (or runtime-based obfuscators) to protect malicious apps from being analyzed. Although many unpacking tools have been proposed, they can be easily impeded by the anti-analysis methods adopted by the packers, and they fail to effectively collect the hidden Dex data due to the evolving protection strategies of packers. Consequently, many packing behaviors are unknown to analysts and packed malware can circumvent the inspection. To fill the gap, in this paper, we propose a novel hardware-assisted approach that first monitors the packing behaviors and then selects the proper approach to unpack the packed apps. Moreover, we develop a prototype named Happerwith a domain-specific language named behavior description language (BDL) for the ease of extending Happerafter tackling several technical challenges. We conduct extensive experiments with 12 commercial Android packers and more than 24k Android apps to evaluate Happer. The results show that Happerobserved 27 packing behaviors, 17 of which have not been elaborated by previous studies. Based on the observed packing behaviors, Happeradopted proper approaches to collect all the hidden Dex data and assembled them to valid Dex files.",

        "title": "LINKTELLER: Recovering Private Edges from Graph Neural Networks via Influence Analysis",
        "abstract": "Graph structured data have enabled several successful applications such as recommendation systems and traffic prediction, given the rich node features and edges information. However, these high-dimensional features and high-order adjacency information are usually heterogeneous and held by different data holders in practice. Given such vertical data partition e.g., one data holder will only own either the node features or edge information), different data holders have to develop efficient joint training protocols rather than directly transferring data to each other due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we focus on the edge privacy, and consider a training scenario where the data holder Bob with node features will first send training node features to Alice who owns the adjacency information. Alice will then train a graph neural network (GNN) with the joint information and provide an inference API to Bob. During inference time, Bob is able to provide test node features and query the API to obtain the predictions for test nodes. Under this setting, we first propose a privacy attack LINKTELLER via influence analysis to infer the private edge information held by Alice via designing adversarial queries for Bob. We then empirically show that LINKTELLER is able to recover a significant amount of private edges in different settings, both including inductive (8 datasets) and transductive (3 datasets), under different graph densities, significantly outperforming existing baselines. To further evaluate the privacy leakage for edges, we adapt an existing algorithm for differentially private graph convolutional network (DP GCN) training as well as propose a new DP GCN mechanism LAPGRAPH based on Laplacian mechanism to evaluate LINKTELLER. We show that these DP GCN mechanisms are not always resilient against LINKTELLER empirically under mild privacy guarantees $(\\varepsilon\\gt 5)$. Our studies will shed light on future research towards designing more resilient privacy-preserving GCN models; in the meantime, provide an in-depth understanding about the tradeoff between GCN model utility and robustness against potential privacy attacks.",

        "title": "Diogenes: Lightweight Scalable RSA Modulus Generation with a Dishonest Majority",
        "abstract": "In this work, we design and implement the first protocol for distributed generation of an RSA modulus that can support thousands of parties and offers security against active corruption of an arbitrary number of parties. In a nutshell, we first design a highly optimized protocol for this scale that is secure against passive corruptions, and then amplify its security to withstand active corruptions using lightweight succinct zero-knowledge proofs. Our protocol achieves security with \"identifiable abort,\" where a corrupted party is identified whenever the protocol aborts, and supports public verifiability.Our protocol against passive corruptions extends the recent work of Chen et al. (CRYPTO 2020) that, in turn, is based on the blueprint introduced in the original work of Boneh-Franklin protocol (CRYPTO 1997, J. ACM, 2001). Specifically, we reduce the task of sampling a modulus to secure distributed multiplication, which we implement via an efficient threshold additively homomorphic encryption scheme based on the Ring-LWE assumption. This results in a protocol where the (amortized) per-party communication cost grows logarithmically in the number of parties. In order to minimize the work done by the parties, we employ a \"publicly verifiable\" coordinator that is connected to all parties and only performs computations on public data.We implemented both the passive and the active variants of our protocol and ran experiments using 2 to 4,000 parties. This is the first implementation of any MPC protocol that can scale to more than 1,000 parties. For generating a 2048-bit modulus among 1,000 parties, our passive protocol executed in under 6 minutes and the active variant ran in under 25 minutes.",

        "abstract": "Bluetooth provides encryption, authentication, and integrity protection of its connections. These protection mechanisms require that Bluetooth devices initially establish trust on first use through a process called pairing. Throughout this process, multiple alternative pairing methods are supported.In this paper, we describe a design flaw in the pairing mechanism of Bluetooth. This flaw permits two devices to perform pairing using differing methods. While successfully interacting with each other, the devices are not aware of the Method Confusion. We explain how an attacker can cause and abuse this Method Confusion to mount a Method Confusion Attack. In contrast to other attacks targeting the pairing method, our attack applies even in Bluetooth\u2019s highest security mode and cannot be mitigated in the protocol. Through the Method Confusion Attack, an adversary can infiltrate the secured connection between the victims and intercept all traffic.Our attack is successful in practically relevant scenarios. We implemented it as an end-to-end Proof of Concept for Bluetooth Low Energy and tested it with off-the-shelf smartphones, a smartwatch and a banking device. Furthermore, we performed a user study where none of the 40 participants noticed the ongoing attack, and 37 (92.5%) of the users completed the pairing process. Finally, we propose changes to the Bluetooth specification that immunize it against our attack.",

        "abstract": "Code instrumentation and hardware based event trapping are two primary approaches used in dynamic malware analysis systems. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Execution Flow Instrumentation (EFI) where the analyzer execution flow is interleaved with the target flow in user- and kernel-mode, at junctures flexibly chosen by the analyzer at runtime. We also propose OASIS as the system infrastructure to realize EFI with virtues of the current two approaches, however without their drawbacks. Despite being securely and transparently isolated from the target, the analyzer introspects and controls it in the same native way as instrumentation code. We have implemented a prototype of OASIS and rigorously evaluated it with various experiments including performance and anti-analysis benchmark tests. We have also conducted two EFI case studies. The first is a cross-space control flow tracer and the second includes two EFI tools working in tandem with Google Syzkaller. One tool makes a dynamic postmortem analysis according to a kernel crash report; and the other explores the behavior of a malicious kernel space device driver which evades Syzkaller logging. The studies show that EFI analyzers are well-suited for fine-grained on-demand dynamic analysis upon a malicious thread in user or kernel mode. It is easy to develop agile EFI tools as they are user-space programs.",

        "abstract": "Modern x86 processors have many prefetch instructions that can be used by programmers to boost performance. However, these instructions may also cause security problems. In particular, we found that on Intel processors, there are two security flaws in the implementation of PREFETCHW, an instruction for accelerating future writes. First, this instruction can execute on data with read-only permission. Second, the execution time of this instruction leaks the current coherence state of the target data. Based on these two design issues, we build two cross-core private cache attacks that work with both inclusive and non-inclusive LLCs, named Prefetch+Reload and Prefetch+Prefetch. We demonstrate the significance of our attacks in different scenarios. First, in the covert channel case, Prefetch+Reload and Prefetch+Prefetch achieve 782 KB/s and 822 KB/s channel capacities, when using only one shared cache line between the sender and receiver, the largest-to-date single-line capacities for CPU cache covert channels. Further, in the side channel case, our attacks can monitor the access pattern of the victim on the same processor, with almost zero error rate. We show that they can be used to leak private information of real-world applications such as cryptographic keys. Finally, our attacks can be used in transient execution attacks in order to leak more secrets within the transient window than prior work. From the experimental results, our attacks allow leaking about 2 times as many secret bytes, compared to Flush+Reload, which is widely used in transient execution attacks.",

        "title": "Bookworm Game: Automatic Discovery of LTE Vulnerabilities Through Documentation Analysis",
        "abstract": "In the past decade, the security of cellular networks has been increasingly under scrutiny, leading to the discovery of numerous vulnerabilities that expose the network and its users to a wide range of security risks, from denial of service to information leak. However, most of these findings have been made through ad-hoc manual analysis, which is inadequate for fundamentally enhancing the security assurance of a system as complex as the cellular network. An important observation is that the massive amount of technical documentation of cellular network can provide key insights into the protection it puts in place and help identify potential security flaws. Particularly, we found that such documentation often contains hazard indicators (HIs) \u2013 the statement that describes a risky operation (e.g., abort an ongoing procedure) when a certain event happens at a state, which can guide a test on the system to find out whether the operation can indeed be triggered by an unauthorized party to cause harm to the cellular core or legitimate users\u2019 equipment. Based upon this observation, we present in this paper a new framework that makes the first step toward intelligent and systematic security analysis of cellular networks. Our approach, called Atomic, utilizes natural-language processing and machine learning techniques to scan a large amount of LTE documentation for HIs. The HIs discovered are further parsed and analyzed to recover state and event information for generating test cases. These test cases are further utilized to automatically construct tests in an LTE simulation environment, which runs the tests to detect the vulnerabilities in the LTE that allow the risky operations to happen without proper protection. In our research, we implemented Atomic and ran it on the LTE NAS specification, including 549 pages with 13,598 sentences and 283,850 words. In less than 5 hours, our prototype reported 42 vulnerabilities from 192 HIs discovered, including 10 never reported before, under two threat models. All these vulnerabilities have been confirmed through end-to-end attacks, which lead to unauthorized disruption of the LTE service a legitimate user\u2019s equipment receives. We reported our findings to authorized parties and received their confirmation that these vulnerabilities indeed exist in major commercial carriers and $2,000 USD reward from Google.",

        "abstract": "Vector mean estimation is a central primitive in federated analytics. In vector mean estimation, each user $i \\in[n]$ holds a real-valued vector $v_{i} \\in[-1,1]^{d}$, and a server wants to estimate the mean of all n vectors; we would additionally like to protect each user\u2019s privacy. In this paper, we consider the k-sparse version of the vector mean estimation problem. That is, suppose each user\u2019s vector has at most k non-zero coordinates in its d-dimensional vector, and moreover, $k \\ll d$. In practice, since the universe size d can be very large (e.g., the space of all possible URLs), we would like the per-user communication to be succinct, i.e., independent of or (poly-)logarithmic in the universe size.In this paper, we show matching upper- and lower-bounds for the k-sparse vector mean estimation problem under local differential privacy (LDP). Specifically, we construct new mechanisms that achieve asymptotically optimal error as well as succinct communication, either under user-level-LDP or event-level-LDP. We implement our algorithms and evaluate them on synthetic and real-world datasets. Our experiments show that we can often achieve one or two orders of magnitude reduction in error compared with prior work under typical choices of parameters, while incurring insignificant communication cost.",

        "title": "Reading Between the Lines: An Extensive Evaluation of the Security and Privacy Implications of EPUB Reading Systems",
        "abstract": "In recent years, e-books have proven to be a very appealing alternative to physical books; nowadays, almost every written book is published in an electronic format next to its physical copy. In an attempt to promote consensus and to offer an alternative to emerging proprietary e-book formats, the Open eBook format was introduced, now known as the EPUB format. Building on existing web functionalities, this open format relies primarily on XHTML and CSS to construct e-books. As such, browser engines are often employed to render the contents of EPUBs. However, this implies that reading systems may face similar vulnerabilities as web browsers.In this paper, we report on a semi-automated evaluation of the security and privacy aspects of EPUB reading systems. This evaluation, which was performed on 97 EPUB reading systems covering seven platforms and five physical reading devices, revealed that almost none of the JavaScript-supporting reading systems sufficiently adhere to the EPUB specification\u2019s security recommendations. Furthermore, our results indicate that 16 reading systems even allow an EPUB to leak information about the user\u2019s file system, and in eight cases extract file contents. In addition to the semi-automated evaluation, we demonstrate that an attacker can launch even more potent attacks that may lead to a full compromise of a user\u2019s system, by exploiting aspects specific to the implementation of reading systems used by millions of users. Finally, we investigate the root cause of the identified security and privacy issues, uncovering several flaws in both the implementation of EPUB reading system, as well as shortcomings of the EPUB specification.",

While these protocols achieve low error, the number of messages sent by each user\u2014the message complexity\u2014has so far scaled with d or the privacy parameters. The message complexity is an informative predictor of a shuffle protocol\u2019s resource consumption. We present a protocol whose message complexity is two when there are sufficiently many users. The protocol essentially pairs each row in the dataset with a fake row and performs a simple randomization on all rows. We show that the error introduced by the protocol is small, using rigorous analysis as well as experiments on real-world data. We also prove that corrupt users have a relatively low impact on our protocol\u2019s estimates.",

        "title": "On the Just-In-Time Discovery of Profit-Generating Transactions in DeFi Protocols",
        "abstract": "Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a blockchain-asset-enabled finance ecosystem with millions of daily USD transaction volume, billions of locked up USD, as well as a plethora of newly emerging protocols (for lending, staking, and exchanges). Because all transactions, user balances, and total value locked in DeFi are publicly readable, a natural question that arises is: how can we automatically craft profitable transactions across the intertwined DeFi platforms?In this paper, we investigate two methods that allow us to automatically create profitable DeFi trades, one well-suited to arbitrage and the other applicable to more complicated settings. We first adopt the Bellman-Ford-Moore algorithm with DeFiPoser-ARB and then create logical DeFi protocol models for a theorem prover in DeFiPoser-SMT. While DeFiPoser-ARB focuses on DeFi transactions that form a cycle and performs very well for arbitrage, DeFiPoser-SMT can detect more complicated profitable transactions. We estimate that DeFiPoser-ARB and DeFiPoser-SMT can generate an average weekly revenue of 191.48 ETH (76,592 USD) and 72.44 ETH (28,976 USD) respectively, with the highest transaction revenue being 81.31 ETH (32,524 USD) and 22.40 ETH (8,960 USD) respectively. We further show that DeFiPoser-SMT finds the known economic bZx attack from February 2020, which yields 0.48M USD. Our forensic investigations show that this opportunity existed for 69 days and could have yielded more revenue if exploited one day earlier. Our evaluation spans 150 days, given 96 DeFi protocol actions, and 25 assets.Looking beyond the financial gains mentioned above, forks deteriorate the blockchain consensus security, as they increase the risks of double-spending and selfish mining. We explore the implications of DeFiPoser-ARB and DeFiPoser-SMT on blockchain consensus. Specifically, we show that the trades identified by our tools exceed the Ethereum block reward by up to 874\u00d7. Given optimal adversarial strategies provided by a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we quantify the value threshold at which a profitable transaction qualifies as Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and would incentivize MEV-aware miners to fork the blockchain. For instance, we find that on Ethereum, a miner with a hash rate of 10% would fork the blockchain if an MEV opportunity exceeds 4\u00d7 the block reward.",

        "title": "Black Widow: Blackbox Data-driven Web Scanning",
        "abstract": "Modern web applications are an integral part of our digital lives. As we put more trust in web applications, the need for security increases. At the same time, detecting vulnerabilities in web applications has become increasingly hard, due to the complexity, dynamism, and reliance on third-party components. Blackbox vulnerability scanning is especially challenging because (i) for deep penetration of web applications scanners need to exercise such browsing behavior as user interaction and asynchrony, and (ii) for detection of nontrivial injection attacks, such as stored cross-site scripting (XSS), scanners need to discover inter-page data dependencies.This paper illuminates key challenges for crawling and scanning the modern web. Based on these challenges we identify three core pillars for deep crawling and scanning: navigation modeling, traversing, and tracking inter-state dependencies. While prior efforts are largely limited to the separate pillars, we suggest an approach that leverages all three. We develop Black Widow, a blackbox data-driven approach to web crawling and scanning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the crawling by code coverage improvements ranging from 63% to 280% compared to other crawlers across all applications. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the web vulnerability scanning by featuring no false positives and finding more cross-site scripting vulnerabilities than previous methods. In older applications, used in previous research, we find vulnerabilities that the other methods miss. We also find new vulnerabili-ties in production software, including HotCRP, osCommerce, PrestaShop and WordPress.",

        "abstract": "Property inference attacks consider an adversary who has access to a trained ML model and tries to extract some global statistics of the training data. In this work, we study property inference in scenarios where the adversary can maliciously control a part of the training data (poisoning data) with the goal of increasing the leakage. Previous works on poisoning attacks focused on trying to decrease the accuracy of models. Here, for the first time, we study poisoning attacks where the goal of the adversary is to increase the information leakage of the model. We show that poisoning attacks can boost the information leakage significantly and should be considered as a stronger threat model in sensitive applications where some of the data sources may be malicious.We theoretically prove that our attack can always succeed as long as the learning algorithm used has good generalization properties. Then we experimentally evaluate our on different datasets (Census dataset, Enron email dataset, MNIST and CelebA), properties (that are present in the training data as features, that are not present as features, and properties that are uncorrelated with the rest of the training data or classification task) and model architectures (including Resnet-18 and Resnet-50). We were able to achieve high attack accuracy with relatively low poisoning rate, namely, 2\u20133% poisoning in most of our experiments. We also evaluated our attacks on models trained with DP and we show that even with very small values for $\\epsilon$, the attack is still quite successful1.1Code is available at https://github.com/smahloujifar/PropertyInferenceFromPoisoning.git",

        "abstract": "Bluetooth Low Energy advertisements are increasingly used for proximity privacy-preserving protocols. We investigate information leakage from BLE advertisements. Our analysis, among other things, reveals that the design of today\u2019s Bluetooth chips enables the linking of BLE advertisements to Bluetooth Classic (BTC) frames, and to a globally unique identifier (BDADDR). We demonstrate that the inference of the BDADDR from BLE advertisements is robust achieving over 90% reliability across apps, mobile devices, density of devices, and tens of meters away from the victims. We discuss the implications of current chipsets vulnerability on privacy-preserving protocols. The attack, for instance, reveals the BDADDR of devices of infected users of contact-tracing apps. We also discuss how the vulnerability can lead to de-anonymization of victims. Furthermore, current mobile devices do not allow selective disabling of BTC independently of BLE which renders simple countermeasures impractical. We developed several mitigations for the Android OS and the Bluetooth stack and demonstrate their efficacy.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present findings from a largescale and long-term phishing experiment that we conducted in collaboration with a partner company. Our experiment ran for 15 months during which time more than 14,000 study participants (employees of the company) received different simulated phishing emails in their normal working context. We also deployed a reporting button to the company\u2019s email client which allowed the participants to report suspicious emails they received. We measured click rates for phishing emails, dangerous actions such as submitting credentials, and reported suspicious emails. The results of our experiment provide three types of contributions. First, some of our findings support previous literature with improved ecological validity. One example of such results is good effectiveness of warnings on emails. Second, some of our results contradict prior literature and common industry practices. Surprisingly, we find that embedded training during simulated phishing exercises, as commonly deployed in the industry today, does not make employees more resilient to phishing, but instead it can have unexpected side effects that can make employees even more susceptible to phishing. And third, we report new findings. In particular, we are the first to demonstrate that using the employees as a collective phishing detection mechanism is practical in large organizations. Our results show that such crowd-sourcing allows fast detection of new phishing campaigns, the operational load for the organization is acceptable, and the employees remain active over long periods of time.",

        "title": "ARBITRAR: User-Guided API Misuse Detection",
        "abstract": "Software APIs exhibit rich diversity and complexity which not only renders them a common source of programming errors but also hinders program analysis tools for checking them. Such tools either expect a precise API specification, which requires program analysis expertise, or presume that correct API usages follow simple idioms that can be automatically mined from code, which suffers from poor accuracy. We propose a new approach that allows regular programmers to find API misuses. Our approach interacts with the user to classify valid and invalid usages of each target API method. It minimizes user burden by employing an active learning algorithm that ranks API usages by their likelihood of being invalid. We implemented our approach in a tool called ARBITRAR for C/C++ programs, and applied it to check the uses of 18 API methods in 21 large real-world programs, including OpenSSL and Linux Kernel. Within just 3 rounds of user interaction on average per API method, ARBITRAR found 40 new bugs, with patches accepted for 18 of them. Moreover, ARBITRAR finds all known bugs reported by a state-of-the-art tool APISAN in a benchmark suite comprising 92 bugs with a false positive rate of only 51.5% compared to APISAN\u2019s 87.9%.",

        "abstract": "Widely deployed deep neural network (DNN) models have been proven to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in many applications (e.g., image, audio and text classifications). To date, there are only a few adversarial perturbations proposed to deviate the DNN models in video recognition systems by simply injecting 2D perturbations into video frames. However, such attacks may overly perturb the videos without learning the spatio-temporal features (across temporal frames), which are commonly extracted by DNN models for video recognition. To our best knowledge, we propose the first black-box attack framework that generates universal 3-dimensional (U3D) perturbations to subvert a variety of video recognition systems. U3D has many advantages, such as (1) as the transfer-based attack, U3D can universally attack multiple DNN models for video recognition without accessing to the target DNN model; (2) the high transferability of U3D makes such universal black-box attack easy-to-launch, which can be further enhanced by integrating queries over the target model when necessary; (3) U3D ensures human-imperceptibility; (4) U3D can bypass the existing state-of-the-art defense schemes; (5) U3D can be efficiently generated with a few pre-learned parameters, and then immediately injected to attack real-time DNN-based video recognition systems. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate U3D on multiple DNN models and three large-scale video datasets. The experimental results demonstrate its superiority and practicality.",

        "abstract": "We present CanDID, a platform for practical, user-friendly realization of decentralized identity, the idea of empowering end users with management of their own credentials.While decentralized identity promises to give users greater control over their private data, it burdens users with management of private keys, creating a significant risk of key loss. Existing and proposed approaches also presume the spontaneous availability of a credential-issuance ecosystem, creating a bootstrapping problem. They also omit essential functionality, like resistance to Sybil attacks and the ability to detect misbehaving or sanctioned users while preserving user privacy.CanDID addresses these challenges by issuing credentials in a user-friendly way that draws securely and privately on data from existing, unmodified web service providers. Such legacy compatibility similarly enables CanDID users to leverage their existing online accounts for recovery of lost keys. Using a decentralized committee of nodes, CanDID provides strong confidentiality for user\u2019s keys, real-world identities, and data, yet prevents users from spawning multiple identities and allows identification (and blacklisting) of sanctioned users.We present the CanDID architecture and report on experiments demonstrating its practical performance.",

        "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition and voice identification systems are being deployed in a wide array of applications, from providing control mechanisms to devices lacking traditional interfaces, to the automatic transcription of conversations and authentication of users. Many of these applications have significant security and privacy considerations. We develop attacks that force mistranscription and misidentification in state of the art systems, with minimal impact on human comprehension. Processing pipelines for modern systems are comprised of signal preprocessing and feature extraction steps, whose output is fed to a machine-learned model. Prior work has focused on the models, using white-box knowledge to tailor model-specific attacks. We focus on the pipeline stages before the models, which (unlike the models) are quite similar across systems. As such, our attacks are black-box, transferable, can be tuned to require zero queries to the target, and demonstrably achieve mistranscription and misidentification rates as high as 100% by modifying only a few frames of audio. We perform a study via Amazon Mechanical Turk demonstrating that there is no statistically significant difference between human perception of regular and perturbed audio. Our findings suggest that models may learn aspects of speech that are generally not perceived by human subjects, but that are crucial for model accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Verifiable mix nets, and specifically proofs of (correct) shuffle, are a fundamental building block in numerous applications: these zero-knowledge proofs allow the prover to produce a public transcript which can be perused by the verifier to confirm the purported shuffle. They are particularly vital to verifiable electronic voting, where they underpin almost all voting schemes with non-trivial tallying methods. These complicated pieces of cryptography are a prime location for critical errors which might allow undetected modification of the outcome.The best solution to preventing these errors is to machine-check the cryptographic properties of the design and implementation of the mix net. Particularly crucial for the integrity of the outcome is the soundness of the design and implementation of the verifier (software). Unfortunately, several different encryption schemes are used in many different slight variations which makes it infeasible to machine-check every single case individually. However, a particular optimised variant of the Terelius-Wikstr\u00f6m mix net is, and has been, widely deployed in elections including national elections in Norway, Estonia and Switzerland, albeit with many slight variations and several different encryption schemes.In this work, we develop the logical theory and formal methods tools to machine-check the design and implementation of all these variants of Terelius-Wikstr\u00f6m mix nets, for all the different encryption schemes used; resulting in provably correct mix nets for all these different variations. We do this carefully to ensure that we can extract a formally verified implementation of the verifier (software) which is compatible with existing deployed implementations of the Terelius-Wikstr\u00f6m mix net. This gives us provably correct implementations of the verifiers for more than half of the national elections which have used verifiable mix nets.Our implementation of a proof of correct shuffle is the first to be machine-checked to be cryptographically correct and able to verify proof transcripts from national elections. We demonstrate the practicality of our implementation by verifying transcripts produced by the Verificatum mix net system and the CHVote e-voting system from Switzerland.",

        "title": "Invisible Probe: Timing Attacks with PCIe Congestion Side-channel",
        "abstract": "PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect express) protocol is the de facto protocol to bridge CPU and peripheral devices like GPU, NIC, and SSD drive. There is an increasing demand to install more peripheral devices on a single machine, but the PCIe interfaces offered by Intel CPUs are fixed. To resolve such contention, PCIe switch, PCH (Platform Controller Hub), or virtualization cards are installed on the machine to allow multiple devices to share a PCIe interface. Congestion happens when the collective PCIe traffic from the devices overwhelm the PCIe link capacity, and transmission delay is then introduced.In this work, we found the PCIe delay not only harms device performance but also leaks sensitive information about a user who uses the machine. In particular, as user\u2019s activities might trigger data movement over PCIe (e.g., between CPU and GPU), by measuring PCIe congestion, an adversary accessing another device can infer the victim\u2019s secret indirectly. Therefore, the delay resulted from I/O congestion can be exploited as a side-channel. We demonstrate the threat from PCIe congestion through 2 attack scenarios and 4 victim settings. Specifically, an attacker can learn the workload of a GPU in a remote server by probing a RDMA NIC that shares the same PCIe switch and measuring the delays. Based on the measurement, the attacker is able to know the keystroke timings of the victim, what webpage is rendered on the GPU, and what machine-learning model is running on the GPU. Besides, when the victim is using a low-speed device, e.g., an Ethernet NIC, an attacker controlling an NVMe SSD can launch a similar attack when they share a PCH or virtualization card. The evaluation result shows our attack can achieve high accuracy (e.g., 96.31% accuracy in inferring webpage visited by a victim).",

In this paper, we investigate security and privacy in the age of commercial drones. First, we focus on the research question: Are drones and their ecosystems protected against attacks performed by malicious entities? We list a drone\u2019s targets, present a methodology for reviewing attack and countermeasure methods, perform a comprehensive review, analyze scientific gaps, present conclusions, and discuss future research directions. Then, we focus on the research question: Is society protected against attacks conducted using drones? We list targets within society, profile the adversaries, review threats, present a methodology for reviewing countermeasures, perform a comprehensive review, analyze scientific gaps, present conclusions, and discuss future research directions. Finally, we focus on the primary research question: From the security and privacy perspective, are society and drones prepared to take their relationship one step further? Our analysis reveals that the technological means required to protect drones and society from one another has not yet been developed, and there is a tradeoff between the security and privacy of drones and that of society. That is, the level of security and privacy cannot be optimized concurrently for both entities, because the security and privacy of drones cannot be optimized without decreasing the security and privacy of society, and vice versa.",

        "abstract": "Even though recent years have seen many attacks exposing severe vulnerabilities in Federated Learning (FL), a holistic understanding of what enables these attacks and how they can be mitigated effectively is still lacking. In this work, we demystify the inner workings of existing (targeted) attacks. We provide new insights into why these attacks are possible and why a definitive solution to FL robustness is challenging. We show that the need for ML algorithms to memorize tail data has significant implications for FL integrity. This phenomenon has largely been studied in the context of privacy; our analysis sheds light on its implications for ML integrity. We show that certain classes of severe attacks can be mitigated effectively by enforcing constraints such as norm bounds on clients\u2019 updates. We investigate how to efficiently incorporate these constraints into secure FL protocols in the single-server setting. Based on this, we propose RoFL, a new secure FL system that extends secure aggregation with privacy-preserving input validation. Specifically, RoFL can enforce constraints such as L2 and L\u221e bounds on high-dimensional encrypted model updates.",

        "title": "StochFuzz: Sound and Cost-effective Fuzzing of Stripped Binaries by Incremental and Stochastic Rewriting",
        "abstract": "Fuzzing stripped binaries poses many hard challenges as fuzzers require instrumenting binaries to collect runtime feedback for guiding input mutation. However, due to the lack of symbol information, correct instrumentation is difficult on stripped binaries. Existing techniques either rely on hardware and expensive dynamic binary translation engines such as QEMU, or make impractical assumptions such as binaries do not have inlined data. We observe that fuzzing is a highly repetitive procedure providing a large number of trial-and-error opportunities. As such, we propose a novel incremental and stochastic rewriting technique StochFuzz that piggy-backs on the fuzzing procedure. It generates many different versions of rewritten binaries whose validity can be approved/disapproved by numerous fuzzing runs. Probabilistic analysis is used to aggregate evidence collected through the sample runs and improve rewriting. The process eventually converges on a correctly rewritten binary. We evaluate StochFuzz on two sets of real-world programs and compare with five other baselines. The results show that StochFuzz outperforms state-of-the-art binary-only fuzzers (e.g., e9patch, ddisasm, and RetroWrite) in terms of soundness and cost-effectiveness and achieves performance comparable to source-based fuzzers. StochFuzz is publicly available [1].",

        "abstract": "Modern digital signature schemes can provide more guarantees than the standard notion of (strong) unforgeability, such as offering security even in the presence of maliciously generated keys, or requiring to know a message to produce a signature for it. The use of signature schemes that lack these properties has previously enabled attacks on real-world protocols. In this work we revisit several of these notions beyond unforgeability, establish relations among them, provide the first formal definition of non re-signability, and a transformation that can provide these properties for a given signature scheme in a provable and efficient way.Our results are not only relevant for established schemes: for example, the ongoing NIST PQC competition towards standardizing post-quantum signature schemes has six finalists in its third round. We perform an in-depth analysis of the candidates with respect to their security properties beyond unforgeability. We show that many of them do not yet offer these stronger guarantees, which implies that the security guarantees of these post-quantum schemes are not strictly stronger than, but instead incomparable to, classical signature schemes. We show how applying our transformation would efficiently solve this, paving the way for the standardized schemes to provide these additional guarantees and thereby making them harder to misuse.",

        "abstract": "A membership inference attack allows an adversary to query a trained machine learning model to predict whether or not a particular example was contained in the model\u2019s training dataset. These attacks are currently evaluated using average-case \u201caccuracy\u201d metrics that fail to characterize whether the attack can confidently identify any members of the training set. We argue that attacks should instead be evaluated by computing their true-positive rate at low (e.g., \u2264 0.1%) false-positive rates, and find most prior attacks perform poorly when evaluated in this way. To address this we develop a Likelihood Ratio Attack (LiRA) that carefully combines multiple ideas from the literature. Our attack is $10\\times$ more powerful at low false-positive rates, and also strictly dominates prior attacks on existing metrics.",

        "abstract": "Training machine learning (ML) models typically involves expensive iterative optimization. Once the model\u2019s final parameters are released, there is currently no mechanism for the entity which trained the model to prove that these parameters were indeed the result of this optimization procedure. Such a mechanism would support security of ML applications in several ways. For instance, it would simplify ownership resolution when multiple parties contest ownership of a specific model. It would also facilitate the distributed training across untrusted workers where Byzantine workers might otherwise mount a denial-ofservice by returning incorrect model updates.In this paper, we remediate this problem by introducing the concept of proof-of-learning in ML. Inspired by research on both proof-of-work and verified computations, we observe how a seminal training algorithm, stochastic gradient descent, accumulates secret information due to its stochasticity. This produces a natural construction for a proof-of-learning which demonstrates that a party has expended the compute require to obtain a set of model parameters correctly. In particular, our analyses and experiments show that an adversary seeking to illegitimately manufacture a proof-of-learning needs to perform at least as much work than is needed for gradient descent itself.We also instantiate a concrete proof-of-learning mechanism in both of the scenarios described above. In model ownership resolution, it protects the intellectual property of models released publicly. In distributed training, it preserves availability of the training procedure. Our empirical evaluation validates that our proof-of-learning mechanism is robust to variance induced by the hardware (e.g., ML accelerators) and software stacks.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a causal model inspired by structural equation modeling that explains cyber risk outcomes in terms of latent factors measured using reflexive indicators. First, we use the model to classify empirical cyber harm studies. We discover cyber harms are not exceptional in terms of typical or extreme losses. The increasing frequency of data breaches is contested and stock market reactions to cyber incidents are becoming less damaging over time. Focusing on harms alone breeds fatalism; the causal model is most useful in evaluating the effectiveness of security interventions. We show how simple statistical relationships lead to spurious results in which more security spending or applying updates are associated with greater rates of compromise. When accounting for threat and exposure, indicators of security are shown to be important factors in explaining the variance in rates of compromise, especially when the studies use multiple indicators of the security level.",

        "abstract": "Anonymous Zether, proposed by B\u00fcnz, Agrawal, Zamani, and Boneh (FC\u201920), is a private payment design whose wallets demand little bandwidth and need not remain online; this unique property makes it a compelling choice for resource-constrained devices. In this work, we describe an efficient construction of Anonymous Zether. Our protocol features proofs which grow only logarithmically in the size of the \"anonymity sets\" used, improving upon the linear growth attained by prior efforts. It also features competitive transaction sizes in practice (on the order of 3 kilobytes).Our central tool is a new family of extensions to Groth and Kohlweiss\u2019s one-out-of-many proofs (Eurocrypt 2015), which efficiently prove statements about many messages among a list of commitments. These extensions prove knowledge of a secret subset of a public list, and assert that the commitments in the subset satisfy certain properties (expressed as linear equations). Remarkably, our communication remains logarithmic; our computation increases only by a logarithmic multiplicative factor. This technique is likely to be of independent interest.We present an open-source, Ethereum-based implementation of our Anonymous Zether construction.",

        "abstract": "While messaging systems with strong security guarantees are widely used in practice, designing a protocol that scales efficiently to large groups and enjoys similar security guarantees remains largely open. The two existing proposals to date are ART (Cohn-Gordon et al., CCS18) and TreeKEM (IETF, The Messaging Layer Security Protocol, draft). TreeKEM is the currently considered candidate by the IETF MLS working group, but dynamic group operations (i.e. adding and removing users) can cause efficiency issues. In this paper we formalize and analyze a variant of TreeKEM which we term Tainted TreeKEM (TTKEM for short). The basic idea underlying TTKEM was suggested by Millican (MLS mailing list, February 2018). This version is more efficient than TreeKEM for some natural distributions of group operations, we quantify this through simulations.Our second contribution is two security proofs for TTKEM which establish post compromise and forward secrecy even against adaptive attackers. The security loss (to the underlying PKE) in the Random Oracle Model is a polynomial factor, and a quasipolynomial one in the Standard Model. Our proofs can be adapted to TreeKEM as well. Before our work no security proof for any TreeKEM-like protocol establishing tight security against an adversary who can adaptively choose the sequence of operations was known. We also are the first to prove (or even formalize) active security where the server can arbitrarily deviate from the protocol specification. Proving fully active security \u2013 where also the users can arbitrarily deviate \u2013 remains open.",

        "title": "Towards a Rigorous Statistical Analysis of Empirical Password Datasets",
        "abstract": "A central challenge in password security is to characterize the attacker's guessing curve i.e., what is the probability that the attacker will crack a random user's password within the first G guesses. A key challenge is that the guessing curve depends on the attacker's guessing strategy and the distribution of user passwords both of which are unknown to us. In this work we aim to follow Kerckhoffs's principal and analyze the performance of an optimal attacker who knows the password distribution. Let \u03bbG denote the probability that such an attacker can crack a random user's password within G guesses. We develop several statistically rigorous techniques to upper and lower bound \u03bbG given N independent samples from the unknown password distribution ${\\mathcal{P}}$. We show that our upper/lower bounds on \u03bbG hold with high confidence and we apply our techniques to analyze eight large password datasets. Our empirical analysis shows that even state-of-the-art password cracking models are often significantly less guess efficient than an attacker who can optimize its attack based on its (partial) knowledge of the password distribution. We also apply our statistical tools to re-examine different models of the password distribution i.e., the empirical password distribution and Zipf's Law. We find that the empirical distribution closely matches our upper/lower bounds on \u03bbG when the guessing number G is not too large i.e., G \u226a N. However, for larger values of G our empirical analysis rigorously demonstrates that the empirical distribution (resp. Zipf's Law) overestimates the attacker's success rate. We apply our statistical techniques to upper/lower bound the effectiveness of password throttling mechanisms (key-stretching) which are used to reduce the number of attacker guesses G. Finally, if we are willing to make an additional assumption about the way users respond to password restrictions, we can use our statistical techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of various password composition policies which restrict the passwords that users may select.",

        "abstract": "We argue that existing security, privacy, and antiabuse protections fail to address the growing threat of online hate and harassment. In order for our community to understand and address this gap, we propose a taxonomy for reasoning about online hate and harassment. Our taxonomy draws on over 150 interdisciplinary research papers that cover disparate threats ranging from intimate partner violence to coordinated mobs. In the process, we identify seven classes of attacks\u2014such as toxic content and surveillance\u2014that each stem from different attacker capabilities and intents. We also provide longitudinal evidence from a three-year survey that hate and harassment is a pervasive, growing experience for online users, particularly for at-risk communities like young adults and people who identify as LGBTQ+. Responding to each class of hate and harassment requires a unique strategy and we highlight five such potential research directions that ultimately empower individuals, communities, and platforms to do so.",

        "abstract": "Recent secure cache designs aim to mitigate side-channel attacks by randomizing the mapping from memory addresses to cache sets. As vendors investigate deployment of these caches, it is crucial to understand their actual security.In this paper, we consolidate existing randomization-based secure caches into a generic cache model. We then comprehensively analyze the security of existing designs, including CEASER-S and SCATTERCACHE, by mapping them to instances of this model. We tailor cache attacks for randomized caches using a novel PRIME+PRUNE+PROBE technique, and optimize it using burst accesses, bootstrapping, and multi-step profiling. PRIME+ PRUNE+PROBE constructs probabilistic but reliable eviction sets, enabling attacks previously assumed to be computationally infeasible. We also simulate an end-to-end attack, leaking secrets from a vulnerable AES implementation. Finally, a case study of CEASER-S reveals that cryptographic weaknesses in the randomization algorithm can lead to a complete security subversion.Our systematic analysis yields more realistic and comparable security levels for randomized caches. As we quantify how design parameters influence the security level, our work leads to important conclusions for future work on secure cache designs.",

        "abstract": "We introduce the Clockwork Finance Framework (CFF), a general purpose, formal verification framework for mechanized reasoning about the economic security properties of composed decentralized-finance (DeFi) smart contracts.CFF features three key properties. It is contract complete, meaning that it can model any smart contract platform and all its contracts\u2014Turing complete or otherwise. It does so with asymptotically constant model overhead. It is also attack-exhaustive by construction, meaning that it can automatically and mechanically extract all possible economic attacks on users\u2019 cryptocurrency across modeled contracts.Thanks to these properties, CFF can support multiple goals: economic security analysis of contracts by developers, analysis of DeFi trading risks by users, fees UX, and optimization of arbitrage opportunities by bots or miners. Because CFF offers composability, it can support these goals with reasoning over any desired set of potentially interacting smart contract models.We instantiate CFF as an executable model for Ethereum contracts that incorporates a state-of-the-art deductive verifier. Building on previous work, we introduce extractable value (EV), a new formal notion of economic security in composed DeFi contracts that is both a basis for CFF and of general interest.We construct modular, human-readable, composable CFF models of four popular, deployed DeFi protocols in Ethereum: Uniswap, Uniswap V2, Sushiswap, and MakerDAO, representing a combined 24 billion USD in value as of March 2022. We use these models along with some other common models such as flash loans, airdrops and voting to show experimentally that CFF is practical and can drive useful, data-based EV-based insights from real world transaction activity. Without any explicitly programmed attack strategies, CFF uncovers on average an expected $56 million of EV per month in the recent past.",

        "abstract": "Payment channel hubs (PCHs) constitute a promising solution to the inherent scalability problem of blockchain technologies, allowing for off-chain payments between sender and receiver through an intermediary, called the tumbler. While state-of-the-art PCHs provide security and privacy guarantees against a malicious tumbler, they do so by relying on the scripting-based functionality available only at few cryptocurrencies, and they thus fall short of fundamental properties such as backwards compatibility and efficiency.In this work, we present the first PCH protocol to achieve all aforementioned properties. Our PCH builds upon A2L, a novel cryptographic primitive that realizes a three-party protocol for conditional transactions, where the tumbler pays the receiver only if the latter solves a cryptographic challenge with the help of the sender, which implies the sender has paid the tumbler. We prove the security and privacy guarantees of A2L (which carry over to our PCH construction) in the Universal Composability framework and present a provably secure instantiation based on adaptor signatures and randomizable puzzles. We implemented A2L and compared it to TumbleBit, the state-of-the-art Bitcoin-compatible PCH. Asymptotically, A2L has a communication complexity that is constant, as opposed to linear in the security parameter like in TumbleBit. In practice, A2L requires ~33x less bandwidth than TumleBit, while retaining the computational cost (or providing 2x speedup with a preprocessing technique). This demonstrates that A2L (and thus our PCH construction) is ready to be deployed today.In theory, we demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to design a secure and privacy-preserving PCH while requiring only digital signatures and timelock functionality from the underlying scripting language. In practice, this result makes our PCH backwards compatible with virtually all cryptocurrencies available today, even those offering a highly restricted form of scripting language such as Ripple or Stellar. The practical appealing of our construction has resulted in a proof-of-concept implementation in the COMIT Network, a blockchain technology focused on cross-currency payments.",

        "title": "Anti-Tamper Radio: System-Level Tamper Detection for Computing Systems",
        "abstract": "A whole range of attacks becomes possible when adversaries gain physical access to computing systems that process or contain sensitive data. Examples include side-channel analysis, bus probing, device cloning, or implanting hardware Trojans. Defending against these kinds of attacks is considered a challenging endeavor, requiring anti-tamper solutions to monitor the physical environment of the system. Current solutions range from simple switches, which detect if a case is opened, to meshes of conducting material that provide more fine-grained detection of integrity violations. However, these solutions suffer from an intricate trade-off between physical security on the one side and reliability, cost, and difficulty to manufacture on the other.In this work, we demonstrate that radio wave propagation in an enclosed system of complex geometry is sensitive against adversarial physical manipulation. We present an anti-tamper radio (ATR) solution as a method for tamper detection, which combines high detection sensitivity and reliability with ease-of-use. ATR constantly monitors the wireless signal propagation behavior within the boundaries of a metal case. Tamper attempts such as insertion of foreign objects, will alter the observed radio signal response, subsequently raising an alarm.The ATR principle is applicable in many computing systems that require physical security such as servers, ATMs, and smart meters. As a case study, we use 19\u201d servers and thoroughly investigate capabilities and limits of the ATR. Using a custom-built automated probing station, we simulate probing attacks by inserting needles with high precision into protected environments. Our experimental results show that our ATR implementation can detect 16mm insertions of needles of diameter as low as 0.1mm under ideal conditions. In the more realistic environment of a running 19\u201d server, we demonstrate reliable detection of 40mm insertions of needles of diameter 1mm for a period of 10 days.",

        "abstract": "In S&P 21, Jia et al. proposed a new concept/mechanism named proof-of-learning (PoL), which allows a prover to demonstrate ownership of a machine learning model by proving integrity of the training procedure. It guarantees that an adversary cannot construct a valid proof with less cost (in both computation and storage) than that made by the prover in generating the proof. A PoL proof includes a set of intermediate models recorded during training, together with the corresponding data points used to obtain each recorded model. Jia et al. claimed that an adversary merely knowing the final model and training dataset cannot efficiently find a set of intermediate models with correct data points. In this paper, however, we show that PoL is vulnerable to \u201cadversarial examples\u201d! Specifically, in a similar way as optimizing an adversarial example, we could make an arbitrarily-chosen data point \u201cgenerate\u201d a given model, hence efficiently generating intermediate models with correct data points. We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that we are able to generate a valid proof with significantly less cost than generating a proof by the prover.",

        "abstract": "There is burgeoning interest in designing AI-based systems to assist humans in designing computing systems, including tools that automatically generate computer code. The most notable of these comes in the form of the first self-described \u2018AI pair programmer\u2019, GitHub Copilot, which is a language model trained over open-source GitHub code. However, code often contains bugs\u2014and so, given the vast quantity of unvetted code that Copilot has processed, it is certain that the language model will have learned from exploitable, buggy code. This raises concerns on the security of Copilot\u2019s code contributions. In this work, we systematically investigate the prevalence and conditions that can cause GitHub Copilot to recommend insecure code. To perform this analysis we prompt Copilot to generate code in scenarios relevant to high-risk cybersecurity weaknesses, e.g. those from MITRE\u2019s \u201cTop 25\u201d Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) list. We explore Copilot\u2019s performance on three distinct code generation axes\u2014examining how it performs given diversity of weaknesses, diversity of prompts, and diversity of domains. In total, we produce 89 different scenarios for Copilot to complete, producing 1,689 programs. Of these, we found approximately 40% to be vulnerable.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles increasingly exploit computer-vision-based object detection systems to perceive environments and make critical driving decisions. To increase the quality of images, image stabilizers with inertial sensors are added to alleviate image blurring caused by camera jitters. However, such a trend opens a new attack surface. This paper identifies a system-level vulnerability resulting from the combination of the emerging image stabilizer hardware susceptible to acoustic manipulation and the object detection algorithms subject to adversarial examples. By emitting deliberately designed acoustic signals, an adversary can control the output of an inertial sensor, which triggers unnecessary motion compensation and results in a blurred image, even if the camera is stable. The blurred images can then induce object misclassification affecting safety-critical decision making. We model the feasibility of such acoustic manipulation and design an attack framework that can accomplish three types of attacks, i.e., hiding, creating, and altering objects. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks against four academic object detectors (YOLO V3/V4/V5 and Fast R-CNN), and one commercial detector (Apollo). We further introduce the concept of AMpLe attacks, a new class of system-level security vulnerabilities resulting from a combination of adversarial machine learning and physics-based injection of information-carrying signals into hardware.",

        "title": "Model Stealing Attacks Against Inductive Graph Neural Networks",
        "abstract": "Many real-world data come in the form of graphs. Graph neural networks (GNNs), a new family of machine learning (ML) models, have been proposed to fully leverage graph data to build powerful applications. In particular, the inductive GNNs, which can generalize to unseen data, become mainstream in this direction. Machine learning models have shown great potential in various tasks and have been deployed in many real-world scenarios. To train a good model, a large amount of data as well as computational resources are needed, leading to valuable intellectual property. Previous research has shown that ML models are prone to model stealing attacks, which aim to steal the functionality of the target models. However, most of them focus on the models trained with images and texts. On the other hand, little attention has been paid to models trained with graph data, i.e., GNNs. In this paper, we fill the gap by proposing the first model stealing attacks against inductive GNNs. We systematically define the threat model and propose six attacks based on the adversary\u2019s background knowledge and the responses of the target models. Our evaluation on six benchmark datasets shows that the proposed model stealing attacks against GNNs achieve promising performance.1",

        "abstract": "As the web keeps increasing in size, the number of vulnerable and poorly-managed websites increases commensurately. Attackers rely on armies of malicious bots to discover these vulnerable websites, compromising their servers, and exfiltrating sensitive user data. It is, therefore, crucial for the security of the web to understand the population and behavior of malicious bots.In this paper, we report on the design, implementation, and results of Aristaeus, a system for deploying large numbers of \"honeysites\", i.e., websites that exist for the sole purpose of attracting and recording bot traffic. Through a seven-month-long experiment with 100 dedicated honeysites, Aristaeus recorded 26.4 million requests sent by more than 287K unique IP addresses, with 76,396 of them belonging to clearly malicious bots. By analyzing the type of requests and payloads that these bots send, we discover that the average honeysite received more than 37K requests each month, with more than 50% of these requests attempting to brute-force credentials, fingerprint the deployed web applications, and exploit large numbers of different vulnerabilities. By comparing the declared identity of these bots with their TLS handshakes and HTTP headers, we uncover that more than 86.2% of bots are claiming to be Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, yet are built on simple HTTP libraries and command-line tools.",

        "abstract": "Homomorphic encryption (HE) is considered as one of the most important primitives for privacy-preserving applications. However, an efficient approach to evaluate both polynomial and non-polynomial functions on encrypted data is still absent, which hinders the deployment of HE to real-life applications. To address this issue, we propose a practical framework PEGASUS. PEGASUS can efficiently switch back and forth between a packed CKKS ciphertext and FHEW ciphertexts without decryption, allowing us to evaluate arithmetic functions efficiently on the CKKS side, and to evaluate look-up tables on FHEW ciphertexts. Our FHEW \u2192 CKKS conversion algorithm is more practical than the existing methods. We improve the computational complexity from linear to sublinear. Moreover, the size of our conversion key is significantly smaller, e.g., reduced from 80 gigabytes to 12 megabytes. We present extensive benchmarks of PEGASUS, including sigmoid/ReLU/min/max/division, sorting and max-pooling. To further demonstrate the capability of PEGASUS, we developed two more applications. The first one is a private decision tree evaluation whose communication cost is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the previous HE-based approaches. The second one is a secure K-means clustering that is able to run on thousands of encrypted samples in minutes that outperforms the best existing system by 14 \u00d7 \u2013 20\u00d7. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that supports practical K-means clustering using HE in a single server setting.",

        "title": "Adversary Instantiation: Lower Bounds for Differentially Private Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "Differentially private (DP) machine learning allows us to train models on private data while limiting data leakage. DP formalizes this data leakage through a cryptographic game, where an adversary must predict if a model was trained on a dataset D, or a dataset D\u2032 that differs in just one example. If observing the training algorithm does not meaningfully increase the adversary's odds of successfully guessing which dataset the model was trained on, then the algorithm is said to be differentially private. Hence, the purpose of privacy analysis is to upper bound the probability that any adversary could successfully guess which dataset the model was trained on.In our paper, we instantiate this hypothetical adversary in order to establish lower bounds on the probability that this distinguishing game can be won. We use this adversary to evaluate the importance of the adversary capabilities allowed in the privacy analysis of DP training algorithms.For DP-SGD, the most common method for training neural networks with differential privacy, our lower bounds are tight and match the theoretical upper bound. This implies that in order to prove better upper bounds, it will be necessary to make use of additional assumptions. Fortunately, we find that our attacks are significantly weaker when additional (realistic) restrictions are put in place on the adversary's capabilities. Thus, in the practical setting common to many real-world deployments, there is a gap between our lower bounds and the upper bounds provided by the analysis: differential privacy is conservative and adversaries may not be able to leak as much information as suggested by the theoretical bound.",

        "title": "DeepSteal: Advanced Model Extractions Leveraging Efficient Weight Stealing in Memories",
        "abstract": "Recent advancements in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have enabled widespread deployment in multiple security-sensitive domains. The need for resource-intensive training and the use of valuable domain-specific training data have made these models the top intellectual property (IP) for model owners. One of the major threats to DNN privacy is model extraction attacks where adversaries attempt to steal sensitive information in DNN models. In this work, we propose an advanced model extraction framework DeepSteal that steals DNN weights remotely for the first time with the aid of a memory side-channel attack. Our proposed DeepSteal comprises two key stages. Firstly, we develop a new weight bit information extraction method, called HammerLeak, through adopting the rowhammer-based fault technique as the information leakage vector. HammerLeak leverages several novel system-level techniques tailored for DNN applications to enable fast and efficient weight stealing. Secondly, we propose a novel substitute model training algorithm with Mean Clustering weight penalty, which leverages the partial leaked bit information effectively and generates a substitute prototype of the target victim model. We evaluate the proposed model extraction framework on three popular image datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10/100/GTSRB) and four DNN architectures (e.g., ResNet-18/34/Wide-ResNetNGG-11). The extracted substitute model has successfully achieved more than 90% test accuracy on deep residual networks for the CIFAR-10 dataset. Moreover, our extracted substitute model could also generate effective adversarial input samples to fool the victim model. Notably, it achieves similar performance (i.e., ~1-2% test accuracy under attack) as white-box adversarial input attack (e.g., PGD/Trades).",

        "abstract": "Political activism is a worldwide force in geopolitical change and has, historically, helped lead to greater justice, equality, and stopping human rights abuses. A modern revolution\u2014an extreme form of political activism\u2014pits activists, who rely on technology for critical operational tasks, against a resource-rich government that controls the very telecommunications network they must use to operationalize, putting the technology they use under extreme stress. Our work presents insights about activists\u2019 technological defense strategies from interviews with 13 political activists who were active during the 2018-2019 Sudanese revolution. We find that politics and society are driving factors of security and privacy behavior and app adoption. Moreover, a social media blockade can trigger a series of anti-censorship approaches at scale, while a complete internet blackout can cripple activists\u2019 use of technology. Even though the activists\u2019 technological defenses against the threats of surveillance, arrest and physical device seizure were low tech, they were largely sufficient against their adversary. Through these results, we surface key design principles, but we observe that the generalization of design recommendations often runs into fundamental tensions between the security and usability needs of different user groups. Thus, we provide a set of structured questions in an attempt to turn these tensions into opportunities for technology designers and policy makers.",

        "abstract": "In prior work, researchers proposed an Internet of Things (IoT) security and privacy label akin to a food nutrition label, based on input from experts. We conducted a survey with 1,371 Mechanical Turk (MTurk) participants to test the effectiveness of each of the privacy and security attribute-value pairs proposed in that prior work along two key dimensions: ability to convey risk to consumers and impact on their willingness to purchase an IoT device. We found that the values intended to communicate increased risk were generally perceived that way by participants. For example, we found that consumers perceived more risk when a label conveyed that data would be sold to third parties than when it would not be sold at all, and that consumers were more willing to purchase devices when they knew that their data would not be retained or shared with others. However, participants\u2019 risk perception did not always align with their willingness to purchase, sometimes due to usability concerns. Based on our findings, we propose actionable recommendations on how to more effectively present privacy and security attributes on an IoT label to better communicate risk to consumers.",

        "abstract": "As control flow hijacking attacks become more challenging due to the deployment of various exploit mitigation technologies, the leakage of sensitive process data through the exploitation of memory disclosure vulnerabilities is becoming an increasingly important threat. To make matters worse, recently introduced transient execution attacks provide a new avenue for leaking confidential process data. As a response, various approaches for selectively protecting subsets of critical in-memory data have been proposed, which though either require a significant code refactoring effort, or do not scale for large applications.In this paper we present DynPTA, a selective data protection approach that combines static analysis with scoped dynamic data flow tracking (DFT) to keep a subset of manually annotated sensitive data always encrypted in memory. DynPTA ameliorates the inherent overapproximation of pointer analysis\u2014a significant challenge that has prevented previous approaches from supporting large applications\u2014by relying on lightweight label lookups to determine if potentially sensitive data is actually sensitive. Labeled objects are tracked only within the subset of value flows that may carry potentially sensitive data, requiring only a fraction of the program\u2019s code to be instrumented for DFT. We experimentally evaluated DynPTA with real-world applications and demonstrate that it can prevent memory disclosure (Heartbleed) and transient execution (Spectre) attacks from leaking the protected data, while incurring a modest runtime overhead of up to 19.2% when protecting the private TLS key of Nginx with OpenSSL.",

        "abstract": "Fault tolerance of a blockchain is often characterized by the fraction f of \u201cadversarial power\u201d that it can tolerate in the system. Despite the fast progress in blockchain designs in recent years, existing blockchain systems can still only tolerate f below 0.5. Can practically usable blockchains tolerate a malicious majority, i.e., f above 0.5? This work presents a positive answer to this question. We first note that the well-known impossibility of byzantine consensus for f above 0.5 does not carry over to blockchains. To tolerate f above 0.5, we use byzantine broadcast, instead of byzantine consensus, as the core of the blockchain. A major obstacle in doing so, however, is that the resulting blockchain may have extremely low throughput. To overcome this central technical challenge, we propose a novel byzantine broadcast protocol OverlayBB, that can tolerate f above 0.5 while achieving good throughput. Using OverlayBB as the core, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel Proof-of-Stake blockchain called BCube. BCube can tolerate a malicious majority, while achieving practically usable transaction throughput and confirmation latency in our experiments with 10000 nodes and under f=0.7. To our knowledge, BCube is the first blockchain that can achieve such properties.",

        "abstract": "Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS)\u2014 which exploits the super-linear running time of matching regular expressions against carefully crafted inputs\u2014is an emerging class of DoS attacks to web services. One challenging question for a victim web service under ReDoS attacks is how to quickly recover its normal operation after ReDoS attacks, especially these zero-day ones exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities.In this paper, we present RegexNet, the first payload-based, automated, reactive ReDoS recovery system for web services. RegexNet adopts a learning model, which is updated constantly in a feedback loop during runtime, to classify payloads of upcoming requests including the request contents and database query responses. If detected as a cause leading to ReDoS, RegexNet migrates those requests to a sandbox and isolates their execution for a fast, first-measure recovery.We have implemented a RegexNet prototype and integrated it with HAProxy and Node.js. Evaluation results show that RegexNet is effective in recovering the performance of web services against zero-day ReDoS attacks, responsive on reacting to attacks in sub-minute, and resilient to different ReDoS attack types including adaptive ones that are designed to evade RegexNet on purpose.",

Thus, for example, a compact certificate can be used to prove that parties who jointly have a sufficient total account balance have attested to a given block in a blockchain.After defining compact certificates, we demonstrate an effi-cient compact certificate scheme. We then show how to implement such a scheme in a decentralized setting over an unreliable network and in the presence of adversarial parties who wish to disrupt certificate creation.

        "abstract": "Commodity hypervisors are widely deployed to support virtual machines (VMs) on multiprocessor hardware. Their growing complexity poses a security risk. To enable formal verification over such a large codebase, we introduce microverification, a new approach that decomposes a commodity hypervisor into a small core and a set of untrusted services so that we can prove security properties of the entire hypervisor by verifying the core alone. To verify the multiprocessor hypervisor core, we introduce security-preserving layers to modularize the proof without hiding information leakage so we can prove each layer of the implementation refines its specification, and the top layer specification is refined by all layers of the core implementation. To verify commodity hypervisor features that require dynamically changing information flow, we introduce data oracles to mask intentional information flow. We can then prove noninterference at the top layer specification and guarantee the resulting security properties hold for the entire hypervisor implementation. Using microverification, we retrofitted the Linux KVM hypervisor with only modest modifications to its codebase. Using Coq, we proved that the hypervisor protects the confidentiality and integrity of VM data, while retaining KVM\u2019s functionality and performance. Our work is the first machine-checked security proof for a commodity multiprocessor hypervisor.",

        "title": "BadEncoder: Backdoor Attacks to Pre-trained Encoders in Self-Supervised Learning",
        "abstract": "Self-supervised learning in computer vision aims to pre-train an image encoder using a large amount of unlabeled images or (image, text) pairs. The pre-trained image encoder can then be used as a feature extractor to build downstream classifiers for many downstream tasks with a small amount of or no labeled training data. In this work, we propose BadEncoder, the first backdoor attack to self-supervised learning. In particular, our BadEncoder injects backdoors into a pre-trained image encoder such that the downstream classifiers built based on the backdoored image encoder for different downstream tasks simultaneously inherit the backdoor behavior. We formulate our BadEncoder as an optimization problem and we propose a gradient descent based method to solve it, which produces a backdoored image encoder from a clean one. Our extensive empirical evaluation results on multiple datasets show that our BadEncoder achieves high attack success rates while preserving the accuracy of the downstream classifiers. We also show the effectiveness of BadEncoder using two publicly available, real-world image encoders, i.e., Google\u2019s image encoder pre-trained on ImageNet and OpenAI\u2019s Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) image encoder pre-trained on 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the Internet. Moreover, we consider defenses including Neural Cleanse and MNTD (empirical defenses) as well as PatchGuard (a provable defense). Our results show that these defenses are insufficient to defend against BadEncoder, highlighting the needs for new defenses against our BadEncoder.

        "abstract": "Spectre vulnerabilities violate our fundamental assumptions about architectural abstractions, allowing attackers to steal sensitive data despite previously state-of-the-art countermeasures. To defend against Spectre, developers of verification tools and compiler-based mitigations are forced to reason about microarchitectural details such as speculative execution. In order to aid developers with these attacks in a principled way, the research community has sought formal foundations for speculative execution upon which to rebuild provable security guarantees.This paper systematizes the community\u2019s current knowledge about software verification and mitigation for Spectre. We study state-of-the-art software defenses, both with and without associated formal models, and use a cohesive framework to compare the security properties each defense provides. We explore a wide variety of tradeoffs in the expressiveness of formal frameworks, the complexity of defense tools, and the resulting security guarantees. As a result of our analysis, we suggest practical choices for developers of analysis and mitigation tools, and we identify several open problems in this area to guide future work on grounded software defenses.",

Unlike most previous work on post-quantum security for real-world protocols, this variant does not only consider post-quantum confidentiality (or forward secrecy) but also post-quantum authentication. To achieve this, we replace the Diffie-Hellman-based handshake by a more generic approach only using key-encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs). We establish security of PQ-WireGuard, adapting the security proofs for WireGuard in the symbolic model and in the standard model to our construction. We then instantiate this generic construction with concrete post-quantum secure KEMs, which we carefully select to achieve high security and speed. We demonstrate competitiveness of PQ-WireGuard presenting extensive bench-marking results comparing to widely deployed VPN solutions.",

        "abstract": "Recovering binary programs\u2019 call graphs is crucial for inter-procedural analysis tasks and applications based on them. One of the core challenges is recognizing targets of indirect calls (i.e., indirect callees). Existing solutions all have high false positives and negatives, making call graphs inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a new solution Callee combining transfer learning and contrastive learning. The key insight is that, deep neural networks (DNNs) can automatically identify patterns concerning indirect calls. Inspired by the advances in question-answering applications, we utilize contrastive learning to answer the callsite-callee question. However, one of the toughest challenges is that DNNs need large datasets to achieve high performance, while collecting large-scale indirect-call ground truths can be computational-expensive. Therefore, we leverage transfer learning to pre-train DNNs with easy-to-collect direct calls and further fine-tune DNNs for indirect-calls. We evaluate Callee on several groups of targets, and results show that our solution could match callsites to callees with an F1-Measure of 94.6%, much better than state-of-the-art solutions. Further, we apply Callee to two applications \u2013 binary code similarity detection and hybrid fuzzing, and found it could greatly improve their performance.",

        "abstract": "In this work we take a formal look at deniability in group chat applications and introduce the concept of \"epochal signatures\" that allows to turn many secure group chat protocols into deniable ones. Intuitively, the transform works for protocols that use signatures for authentication and that become deniable if the signatures are removed. In contrast to previous proposals that use signatures for entity authentication, like mpOTR (CCS\u201909), our construction does not require pairwise key establishment of participants and allows to add and remove participants without requiring to re-initialize the chat. These properties allow the deployment in protocols that are also designed to scale to very large groups. Finally, we construct a practical epochal signature scheme from generic primitives and prove it secure.",

        "title": "ConDySTA: Context-Aware Dynamic Supplement to Static Taint Analysis",
        "abstract": "Static taint analyses are widely-applied techniques to detect taint flows in software systems. Although they are theoretically conservative and de-signed to detect all possible taint flows, static taint analyses almost always exhibit false negatives due to a variety of implementation limitations. Dynamic programming language features, inaccessible code, and the usage of multiple programming languages in a software project are some of the major causes. To alleviate this problem, we developed a novel approach, DySTA, which uses dynamic taint analysis results as additional sources for static taint analysis. However, na\u00efvely adding sources causes static analysis to lose context sensitivity and thus produce false positives. Thus, we developed a hybrid context matching algorithm and corresponding tool, ConDySTA, to preserve context sensitivity in DySTA. We applied REPRODROID [1], a comprehensive benchmarking framework for Android analysis tools, to evaluate ConDySTA. The results show that across 28 apps (1) ConDySTA was able to detect 12 out of 28 taint flows which were not detected by any of the six state-of-the-art static taint analyses considered in ReproDroid, and (2) ConDySTA reported no false positives, whereas nine were reported by DySTA alone. We further applied ConDySTA and FlowDroid to 100 top Android apps from Google Play, and ConDySTA was able to detect 39 additional taint flows (besides 281 taint flows found by FlowDroid) while preserving the context sensitivity of FlowDroid.",

        "abstract": "Differential privacy is a formal, mathematical definition of data privacy that has gained traction in academia, industry, and government. The task of correctly constructing differentially private algorithms is non-trivial, and mistakes have been made in foundational algorithms. Currently, there is no automated support for converting an existing, non-private program into a differentially private version. In this paper, we propose a technique for automatically learning an accurate and differentially private version of a given non-private program. We show how to solve this difficult program synthesis problem via a combination of techniques: carefully picking representative example inputs, reducing the problem to continuous optimization, and mapping the results back to symbolic expressions. We demonstrate that our approach is able to learn foundational algorithms from the differential privacy literature and significantly outperforms natural program synthesis baselines.",

        "title": "Using Selective Memoization to Defeat Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)",
        "abstract": "Regular expressions (regexes) are a denial of service vector in most mainstream programming languages. Recent empirical work has demonstrated that up to 10% of regexes have super-linear worst-case behavior in typical regex engines. It is therefore not surprising that many web services are reportedly vulnerable to regex denial of service (ReDoS). If the time complexity of a regex engine can be reduced transparently, ReDoS vulnerabilities can be eliminated at no cost to application developers. Unfortunately, existing ReDoS defenses \u2014 replacing the regex engine, optimizing it, or replacing regexes piecemeal \u2014 struggle with soundness and compatibility. Full memoization is sound and compatible, but its space costs are too high. No effective ReDoS defense has been adopted in practice. We present techniques to provably eliminate super-linear regex behavior with low space costs for typical regexes. We propose selective memoization schemes with varying space/time tradeoffs. We then describe an encoding scheme that leverages insights about regex engine semantics to further reduce the space cost of memoization. We also consider how to safely handle extended regex features. We implemented our proposals and evaluated them on a corpus of real-world regexes. We found that selective memoization lowers the space cost of memoization by an order of magnitude for the median regex, and that run-length encoding further lowers the space cost to constant for 90% of regexes. \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\" \u2013George Santayana",

        "abstract": "This paper presents SAILFISH, a scalable system for automatically finding state-inconsistency bugs in smart contracts. To make the analysis tractable, we introduce a hybrid approach that includes (i) a light-weight exploration phase that dramatically reduces the number of instructions to analyze, and (ii) a precise refinement phase based on symbolic evaluation guided by our novel value-summary analysis, which generates extra constraints to over-approximate the side effects of whole-program execution, thereby ensuring the precision of the symbolic evaluation. We developed a prototype of SAILFISH and evaluated its ability to detect two state-inconsistency flaws, viz., reentrancy and transaction order dependence (TOD) in Ethereum smart contracts. Our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our hybrid approach as well as the benefit of the value summary analysis. In particular, we show that SAILFISH outperforms five state-of the-art smart contract analyzers (SECURIFY, MYTHRIL, OYENTE, SEREUM and VANDAL) in terms of performance, and precision. In total, SAILFISH discovered 47 previously unknown vulnerable smart contracts out of 89,853 smart contracts from ETHERSCAN.",

        "abstract": "Commodity I/O hardware often fails to separate I/O transfers of isolated OS and applications code. Even when using the best I/O hardware, commodity systems sometimes trade off separation assurance for increased performance. Remarkably, device firmware need not be malicious. Instead, any malicious driver, even if isolated in its own execution domain, can manipulate its device to breach I/O separation. To prevent such vulnerabilities with high assurance, a formal I/O separation model and its use in automatic generation of secure I/O kernel code is necessary.This paper presents a formal I/O separation model, which defines a separation policy based on authorization of I/O transfers and is hardware agnostic. The model, its refinement, and instantiation in the Wimpy kernel design, are formally specified and verified in Dafny. We then specify the kernel implementation and automatically generate verified-correct assembly code that enforces the I/O separation policies. Our formal modeling enables the discovery of heretofore unknown design and implementation vulnerabilities of the original Wimpy kernel. Finally, we outline how the model can be applied to other I/O kernels and conclude with the key lessons learned.",

        "title": "CrawlPhish: Large-scale Analysis of Client-side Cloaking Techniques in Phishing",
        "abstract": "Phishing is a critical threat to Internet users. Although an extensive ecosystem serves to protect users, phishing websites are growing in sophistication, and they can slip past the ecosystem\u2019s detection systems\u2014and subsequently cause real-world damage\u2014with the help of evasion techniques. Sophisticated client-side evasion techniques, known as cloaking, leverage JavaScript to enable complex interactions between potential victims and the phishing website, and can thus be particularly effective in slowing or entirely preventing automated mitigations. Yet, neither the prevalence nor the impact of client-side cloaking has been studied.In this paper, we present CrawlPhish, a framework for automatically detecting and categorizing client-side cloaking used by known phishing websites. We deploy CrawlPhish over 14 months between 2018 and 2019 to collect and thoroughly analyze a dataset of 112,005 phishing websites in the wild. By adapting state-of-the-art static and dynamic code analysis, we find that 35,067 of these websites have 1,128 distinct implementations of client-side cloaking techniques. Moreover, we find that attackers\u2019 use of cloaking grew from 23.32% initially to 33.70% by the end of our data collection period. Detection of cloaking by our framework exhibited low false-positive and false-negative rates of 1.45% and 1.75%, respectively. We analyze the semantics of the techniques we detected and propose a taxonomy of eight types of evasion across three high-level categories: User Interaction, Fingerprinting, and Bot Behavior.Using 150 artificial phishing websites, we empirically show that each category of evasion technique is effective in avoiding browser-based phishing detection (a key ecosystem defense). Additionally, through a user study, we verify that the techniques generally do not discourage victim visits. Therefore, we propose ways in which our methodology can be used to not only improve the ecosystem\u2019s ability to mitigate phishing websites with client-side cloaking, but also continuously identify emerging cloaking techniques as they are launched by attackers.",

        "abstract": "We introduce CryptGPU, a system for privacy-preserving machine learning that implements all operations on the GPU (graphics processing unit). Just as GPUs played a pivotal role in the success of modern deep learning, they are also essential for realizing scalable privacy-preserving deep learning. In this work, we start by introducing a new interface to losslessly embed cryptographic operations over secret-shared values (in a discrete domain) into floating-point operations that can be processed by highly-optimized CUDA kernels for linear algebra. We then identify a sequence of \"GPU-friendly\" cryptographic protocols to enable privacy-preserving evaluation of both linear and non-linear operations on the GPU. Our microbenchmarks indicate that our private GPU-based convolution protocol is over 150\u00d7 faster than the analogous CPU-based protocol; for non-linear operations like the ReLU activation function, our GPU-based protocol is around 10\u00d7 faster than its CPU analog. With CryptGPU, we support private inference and training on convolutional neural networks with over 60 million parameters as well as handle large datasets like ImageNet. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art, our protocols achieve a 2\u00d7 to 8\u00d7 improvement in private inference for large networks and datasets. For private training, we achieve a 6\u00d7 to 36\u00d7 improvement over prior state-of-the-art. Our work not only showcases the viability of performing secure multiparty computation (MPC) entirely on the GPU to newly enable fast privacy-preserving machine learning, but also highlights the importance of designing new MPC primitives that can take full advantage of the GPU\u2019s computing capabilities.",

        "title": "Bomberman: Defining and Defeating Hardware Ticking Timebombs at Design-time",
        "abstract": "To cope with ever-increasing design complexities, integrated circuit designers increase both the size of their design teams and their reliance on third-party intellectual property (IP). Both come at the expense of trust: it is computationally infeasible to exhaustively verify that a design is free of all possible malicious modifications (i.e., hardware Trojans). Making matters worse, unlike software, hardware modifications are permanent: there is no \"patching\" mechanism for hardware; and powerful: they serve as a foothold for subverting software that sits above.To counter this threat, prior work uses both static and dynamic analysis techniques to verify hardware designs are Trojan-free. Unfortunately, researchers continue to reveal weaknesses in these \"one-size-fits-all\", heuristic-based approaches. Instead of attempting to detect all possible hardware Trojans, we take the first step in addressing the hardware Trojan threat in a divide-and-conquer fashion: defining and eliminating Ticking Timebomb Trojans (TTTs), forcing attackers to implement larger Trojan designs detectable via existing verification and side-channel defenses. Like many system-level software defenses (e.g., Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP)), our goal is to systematically constrict the hardware attacker\u2019s design space.First, we construct a definition of TTTs derived from their functional behavior. Next, we translate this definition into fundamental components required to realize TTT behavior in hardware. Using these components, we expand the set of all known TTTs to a total of six variants\u2014including unseen variants. Leveraging our definition, we design and implement a TTT-specific dynamic verification toolchain extension, called Bomber-man. Using four real-world hardware designs, we demonstrate Bomberman\u2019s ability to detect all TTT variants, where previous defenses fail, with <1.2% false positives.",

        "abstract": "As malware detection algorithms and methods become more sophisticated, malware authors adopt equally sophisticated evasion mechanisms to defeat them. Anecdotal evidence claims Living-Off-The-Land (LotL) techniques are one of the major evasion techniques used in many malware attacks. These techniques leverage binaries already present in the system to conduct malicious actions. We present the first large-scale systematic investigation of the use of these techniques by malware on Windows systems.In this paper, we analyse how common the use of these native system binaries is across several malware datasets, containing a total of 31,805,549 samples. We identify an average 9.41% prevalence. Our results show that the use of LotL techniques is prolific, particularly in Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) malware samples where the prevalence is 26.26%, over twice that of commodity malware.To illustrate the evasive potential of LotL techniques, we test the usage of LotL techniques against several fully patched Windows systems in a local sandboxed environment and show that there is a generalised detection gap in 10 of the most popular anti-virus products.",

In response, a broad suite of so-called \"anti-facial recognition\" (AFR) tools has been developed to help users avoid unwanted facial recognition. The set of AFR tools proposed in the last few years is wide-ranging and rapidly evolving, necessitating a step back to consider the broader design space of AFR systems and long-term challenges. This paper aims to fill that gap and provides the first comprehensive analysis of the AFR research landscape. Using the operational stages of FR systems as a starting point, we create a systematic framework for analyzing the benefits and tradeoffs of different AFR approaches. We then consider both technical and social challenges facing AFR tools and propose directions for future research in this field.",

        "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows a third party to perform arbitrary computations on encrypted data, learning neither the inputs nor the computation results. Hence, it provides resilience in situations where computations are carried out by an untrusted or potentially compromised party. This powerful concept was first conceived by Rivest et al. in the 1970s. However, it remained unrealized until Craig Gentry presented the first feasible FHE scheme in 2009.The advent of the massive collection of sensitive data in cloud services, coupled with a plague of data breaches, moved highly regulated businesses to increasingly demand confidential and secure computing solutions. This demand, in turn, has led to a recent surge in the development of FHE tools. To understand the landscape of recent FHE tool developments, we conduct an extensive survey and experimental evaluation to explore the current state of the art and identify areas for future development.In this paper, we survey, evaluate, and systematize FHE tools and compilers. We perform experiments to evaluate these tools\u2019 performance and usability aspects on a variety of applications. We conclude with recommendations for developers intending to develop FHE-based applications and a discussion on future directions for FHE tools development.",

In this work, we examine the use of large language models (LLMs) for code (such as OpenAI\u2019s Codex and AI21\u2019s Jurassic J-1) for zero-shot vulnerability repair. We investigate challenges in the design of prompts that coax LLMs into generating repaired versions of insecure code. This is difficult due to the numerous ways to phrase key information\u2014 both semantically and syntactically\u2014with natural languages. We perform a large scale study of five commercially available, black-box, \"off-the-shelf\" LLMs, as well as an open-source model and our own locally-trained model, on a mix of synthetic, hand-crafted, and real-world security bug scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that while the approach has promise (the LLMs could collectively repair 100% of our synthetically generated and hand-crafted scenarios), a qualitative evaluation of the model\u2019s performance over a corpus of historical real-world examples highlights challenges in generating functionally correct code.",

        "abstract": "The SPECTRE family of speculative execution attacks has required a rethinking of formal methods for security. Approaches based on operational speculative semantics have made initial inroads towards finding vulnerable code and validating defenses. However, with each new attack grows the amount of microarchitectural detail that has to be integrated into the underlying semantics. We propose an alternative, lightweight and axiomatic approach to specifying speculative semantics that relies on insights from memory models for concurrency. We use the CAT modeling language for memory consistency to specify execution models that capture speculative control flow, store-to-load forwarding, predictive store forwarding, and memory ordering machine clears. We present a bounded model checking framework parameterized by our speculative CAT models and evaluate its implementation against the state of the art. Due to the axiomatic approach, our models can be rapidly extended to allow our framework to detect new types of attacks and validate defenses against them.",

        "abstract": "Language processors, such as compilers and interpreters, are indispensable in building modern software. Errors in language processors can lead to severe consequences, like incorrect functionalities or even malicious attacks. However, it is not trivial to automatically test language processors to find bugs. Existing testing methods (or fuzzers) either fail to generate high-quality (i.e., semantically correct) test cases, or only support limited programming languages.In this paper, we propose POLYGLOT, a generic fuzzing framework that generates high-quality test cases for exploring processors of different programming languages. To achieve the generic applicability, POLYGLOT neutralizes the difference in syntax and semantics of programming languages with a uniform intermediate representation (IR). To improve the language validity, POLYGLOT performs constrained mutation and semantic validation to preserve syntactic correctness and fix semantic errors. We have applied POLYGLOT on 21 popular language processors of 9 programming languages, and identified 173 new bugs, 113 of which are fixed with 18 CVEs assigned. Our experiments show that POLYGLOT can support a wide range of programming languages, and outperforms existing fuzzers with up to 30\u00d7 improvement in code coverage.",

        "abstract": "Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in modern vehicles have recently been targets for shutdown attacks, which can disable safety-critical vehicle functions and be used as means to launch more dangerous attacks. Existing attacks operate either by physical manipulation of the bus signals or message injection. However, we argue that these cannot simultaneously be remote, stealthy, and reliable. For instance, message injection is detected by modern Intrusion Detection System (IDS) proposals and requires strict synchronization that cannot be realized remotely. In this work, we introduce a new class of attacks that leverage the peripheral clock gating feature in modern automotive microcontroller units (MCUs). By using this capability, a remote adversary with purely software control can reliably \"freeze\" the output of a compromised ECU to insert arbitrary bits at any time instance. Utilizing on this insight, we develop the CANnon attack for remote shutdown. Since the CANnon attack produces error patterns indistinguishable from natural errors and does not require message insertion, detecting it with current techniques is difficult. We demonstrate this attack on two automotive MCUs used in modern passenger vehicle ECUs. We discuss potential mitigation strategies and countermeasures for such attacks.",

        "abstract": "Web pages have been steadily increasing in complexity over time, including code snippets from several distinct origins and organizations. While this may be a known phenomenon, its implications on the panorama of cookie tracking received little attention until now. Our study focuses on filling this gap, through the analysis of crawl results that are both large-scale and fine-grained, encompassing the whole set of events that lead to the creation and sharing of around 138 million cookies from crawling more than 6 million webpages. Our analysis lets us paint a highly detailed picture of the cookie ecosystem, discovering an intricate network of connections between players that reciprocally exchange information and include each other's content in web pages whose owners may not even be aware. We discover that, in most webpages, tracking cookies are set and shared by organizations at the end of complex chains that involve several middlemen. We also study the impact of cookie ghostwriting, i.e., a common practice where an entity creates cookies in the name of another party, or the webpage. We attribute and define a set of roles in the cookie ecosystem, related to cookie creation and sharing. We see that organizations can and do follow different patterns, including behaviors that previous studies could not uncover: for example, many cookie ghostwriters send cookies they create to themselves, which makes them able to perform cross-site tracking even for users that deleted third-party cookies in their browsers. While some organizations concentrate the flow of information on themselves, others behave as dispatchers, allowing other organizations to perform tracking on the pages that include their content.",

        "abstract": "The correct use of cryptography is central to ensuring data security in modern software systems. Hence, several academic and commercial static analysis tools have been developed for detecting and mitigating crypto-API misuse. While developers are optimistically adopting these crypto-API misuse detectors (or crypto-detectors) in their software development cycles, this momentum must be accompanied by a rigorous understanding of their effectiveness at finding crypto-API misuse in practice. This paper presents the MASC framework, which enables a systematic and data-driven evaluation of crypto-detectors using mutation testing. We ground MASC in a comprehensive view of the problem space by developing a data-driven taxonomy of existing crypto-API misuse, containing 105 misuse cases organized among nine semantic clusters. We develop 12 generalizable usage-based mutation operators and three mutation scopes that can expressively instantiate thousands of compilable variants of the misuse cases for thoroughly evaluating crypto-detectors. Using MASC, we evaluate nine major crypto-detectors and discover 19 unique, undocumented flaws that severely impact the ability of crypto-detectors to discover misuses in practice. We conclude with a discussion on the diverse perspectives that influence the design of crypto-detectors and future directions towards building security-focused crypto-detectors by design.",

        "title": "Detecting Filter List Evasion with Event-Loop-Turn Granularity JavaScript Signatures",
        "abstract": "Content blocking is an important part of a per-formant, user-serving, privacy respecting web. Current content blockers work by building trust labels over URLs. While useful, this approach has many well understood shortcomings. Attackers may avoid detection by changing URLs or domains, bundling unwanted code with benign code, or inlining code in pages.The common flaw in existing approaches is that they evaluate code based on its delivery mechanism, not its behavior. In this work we address this problem by building a system for generating signatures of the privacy-and-security relevant behavior of executed JavaScript. Our system uses as the unit of analysis each script\u2019s behavior during each turn on the JavaScript event loop. Focusing on event loop turns allows us to build highly identifying signatures for JavaScript code that are robust against code obfuscation, code bundling, URL modification, and other common evasions, as well as handle unique aspects of web applications.This work makes the following contributions to the problem of measuring and improving content blocking on the web: First, we design and implement a novel system to build per-event-loop-turn signatures of JavaScript behavior through deep instrumentation of the Blink and V8 runtimes. Second, we apply these signatures to measure how much privacy-and-security harming code is missed by current content blockers, by using EasyList and EasyPrivacy as ground truth and finding scripts that have the same privacy and security harming patterns. We build 1,995,444 signatures of privacy-and-security relevant behaviors from 11,212 unique scripts blocked by filter lists, and find 3,589 unique scripts hosting known harmful code, but missed by filter lists, affecting 12.48% of websites measured. Third, we provide a taxonomy of ways scripts avoid detection and quantify the occurrence of each. Finally, we present defenses against these evasions, in the form of filter list additions where possible, and through a proposed, signature based system in other cases.As part of this work, we share the implementation of our signature-generation system, the data gathered by applying that system to the Alexa 100K, and 586 AdBlock Plus compatible filter list rules to block instances of currently blocked code being moved to new URLs.",

        "title": "Bitcoin-Compatible Virtual Channels",
        "abstract": "Current permissionless cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin suffer from a limited transaction rate and slow confirmation time, which hinders further adoption. Payment channels are one of the most promising solutions to address these problems, as they allow the parties of the channel to perform arbitrarily many payments in a peer-to-peer fashion while uploading only two transactions on the blockchain. This concept has been generalized into payment channel networks where a path of payment channels is used to settle the payment between two users that might not share a direct channel between them. However, this approach requires the active involvement of each user in the path, making the system less reliable (they might be offline), more expensive (they charge fees per payment), and slower (intermediaries need to be actively involved in the payment). To mitigate this issue, recent work has introduced the concept of virtual channels (IEEE S&P\u201919), which involve intermediaries only in the initial creation of a bridge between payer and payee, who can later on independently perform arbitrarily many off-chain transactions. Unfortunately, existing constructions are only available for Ethereum, as they rely on its account model and Turing-complete scripting language. The realization of virtual channels in other blockchain technologies with limited scripting capabilities, like Bitcoin, was so far considered an open challenge.In this work, we present the first virtual channel protocols that are built on the UTXO-model and require a scripting language supporting only a digital signature scheme and a timelock functionality, being thus backward compatible with virtually every cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin. We formalize the security properties of virtual channels as an ideal functionality in the Universal Composability framework and prove that our protocol constitutes a secure realization thereof. We have prototyped and evaluated our protocol on the Bitcoin blockchain, demonstrating its efficiency: for n sequential payments, they require an off-chain exchange of 9+2n transactions or a total of 3524+695n bytes, with no on-chain footprint in the optimistic case. This is a substantial improvement compared to routing payments in a payment channel network, which requires 8n transactions with a total of 3026n bytes to be exchanged.",

        "abstract": "We build a complete and efficient ZK toolchain that handles proof statements encoded as arbitrary ANSI C programs.Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs are foundational in cryptography. Recent ZK research has focused intensely on non-interactive proofs of small statements, useful in blockchain scenarios. We instead target large statements that are useful, e.g., in proving properties of programs.Recent work (Heath and Kolesnikov, CCS 2020 [HK20a]) designed an efficient proof-of-concept ZK machine (ZKM). Their machine executes arbitrary programs over a minimal instruction set, authenticating in ZK the program execution. In this work, we significantly extend this research thrust, both in terms of efficiency and generality. Our contributions include:\u2022 A rich and performance-oriented architecture for representing arbitrary ZK proofs as programs.\u2022 A complete compiler toolchain providing full support for ANSI C95 programs. We ran off-the-shelf buggy versions of the Linux programs sed and gzip, proving in ZK that each program has a bug. To our knowledge, this is the first ZK system capable of executing standard Linux programs.\u2022 Improved ZK oblivious RAM (ORAM). [HK20a] introduced an efficient ZK-specific ORAM BubbleRAM that consumes O(log2 n) communication per access. We extend BubbleRAM with multi-level caching, decreasing communication to O(log n) per access. This introduces the possibility of a cache miss, which we handle cheaply. Our experiments show that cache misses are rare; in isolation, i.e., ignoring other processor costs, BubbleCache improves communication over BubbleRAM by more than 8\u00d7. Using BubbleCache improves our processor\u2019s total communication (including costs of cache misses) by \u2248 25-30%.\u2022 Numerous low-level optimizations, resulting in a CPU that is both more expressive and \u2248 5.5\u00d7 faster than [HK20a]\u2019s.\u2022 Attention to user experience. Our engineer-facing ZK instrumentation and extensions are minimal and easy to use.Put together, our system is efficient and general, and can run many standard Linux programs. The resultant machine runs at up to 11KHz on a 1Gbps LAN and supports MBs of RAM.",

        "title": "Refresh When You Wake Up: Proactive Threshold Wallets with Offline Devices",
        "abstract": "Proactive security is the notion of defending a distributed system against an attacker who compromises different devices through its lifetime, but no more than a threshold number of them at any given time. The emergence of threshold wallets for more secure cryptocurrency custody warrants an efficient proactivization protocol tailored to this setting. While many proactivization protocols have been devised and studied in the literature, none of them have communication patterns ideal for threshold wallets. In particular a (t, n) threshold wallet is designed to have t parties jointly sign a transaction (of which only one may be honest) whereas even the best current proactivization protocols require at least an additional t\u22121 honest parties to come online simultaneously to refresh the system.In this work we formulate the notion of refresh with offline devices, where any t\u03c1 parties may proactivize the system at any time and the remaining n\u2212t\u03c1 offline parties can non-interactively \"catch up\" at their leisure. However, many subtle issues arise in realizing this pattern. We identify that this problem is divided into two settings: (2, n) and (t, n) where t > 2. We develop novel techniques to address both settings as follows:\u2022We show that the (2, n) setting permits a tight t\u03c1 for refresh. In particular we give a highly efficient t\u03c1 = 2 protocol to upgrade a number of standard (2, n) threshold signature schemes to proactive security with offline refresh. This protocol can augment existing implementations of threshold wallets for immediate use\u2013 we show that proactivization does not have to interfere with their native mode of operation. This technique is compatible with Schnorr, EdDSA, and with some effort even sophisticated ECDSA protocols. By implementation we show that proactivizing two different recent (2, n) ECDSA protocols incurs only 14% and 24% computational overhead respectively, less than 200 bytes, and no extra round of communication.\u2022For the general (t, n) setting we prove that it is impossible to construct an offline refresh protocol with t\u03c1 < 2(t\u22121), i.e. tolerating a dishonest majority of online parties. Our techniques are novel in reasoning about the message complexity of proactive security, and may be of independent interest.Our results are positive for small-scale decentralization (such as 2FA with threshold wallets), and negative for large-scale distributed systems with higher thresholds. We thus initiate the study of proactive security with offline refresh, with a comprehensive treatment of the dishonest majority case.",

        "title": "Practical Timing Side-Channel Attacks on Memory Compression",
        "abstract": "Compression algorithms have side channels due to their data-dependent operations. So far, only the compression-ratio side channel was exploited, e.g., the compressed data size.In this paper, we present Decomp+Time, the first memory-compression attack exploiting a timing side channel in compression algorithms. While Decomp+Time affects a much broader set of applications than prior work. A key challenge is precisely crafting attacker-controlled compression payloads to enable the attack with sufficient resolution. Our evolutionary fuzzer, Comprezzor, finds effective Decomp+Time payloads that optimize latency differences such that decompression timing can even be exploited in remote attacks. Decomp+Time has a capacity of 9.73 kB/s locally, and 10.72 bit/min across the internet (14 hops). Using Comprezzor, we develop attacks that leak data bytewise in four different case studies: First, we leak 1.50 bit/min from Memcached on a remote PHP script. Second, we leak database records with 2.69 bit/min, from PostgreSQL in a Python-Flask application, over the internet. Third, we leak secrets with 49.14 bit/min locally from ZRAM-compressed pages on Linux. Fourth, we leak internal heap pointers from the V8 engine within the Google Chrome browser on a system using ZRAM. Thus, it is important to re-evaluate the use of compression on sensitive data even if the application is only reachable via a remote interface.",

        "title": "DifuzzRTL: Differential Fuzz Testing to Find CPU Bugs",
        "abstract": "Security bugs in CPUs have critical security impacts to all the computation related hardware and software components as it is the core of the computation. In spite of the fact that architecture and security communities have explored a vast number of static or dynamic analysis techniques to automatically identify such bugs, the problem remains unsolved and challenging largely due to the complex nature of CPU RTL designs.This paper proposes DIFUZZRTL, an RTL fuzzer to automatically discover unknown bugs in CPU RTLs. DIFUZZRTL develops a register-coverage guided fuzzing technique, which efficiently yet correctly identifies a state transition in the finite state machine of RTL designs. DIFUZZRTL also develops several new techniques in consideration of unique RTL design characteristics, including cycle-sensitive register coverage guiding, asynchronous interrupt events handling, a unified CPU input format with Tilelink protocols, and drop-in-replacement designs to support various CPU RTLs. We implemented DIFUZZRTL, and performed the evaluation with three real-world open source CPU RTLs: OpenRISC Mor1kx Cappuccino, RISC-V Rocket Core, and RISC-V Boom Core. During the evaluation, DIFUZZRTL identified 16 new bugs from these CPU RTLs, all of which were confirmed by the respective development communities and vendors. Six of those are assigned with CVE numbers, and to the best of our knowledge, we reported the first and the only CVE of RISC-V cores, demonstrating its strong practical impacts to the security community.",

        "title": "Copy, Right? A Testing Framework for Copyright Protection of Deep Learning Models",
        "abstract": "Deep learning models, especially those large-scale and high-performance ones, can be very costly to train, demanding a considerable amount of data and computational resources. As a result, deep learning models have become one of the most valuable assets in modern artificial intelligence. Unauthorized duplication or reproduction of deep learning models can lead to copyright infringement and cause huge economic losses to model owners, calling for effective copyright protection techniques. Existing protection techniques are mostly based on watermarking, which embeds an owner-specified watermark into the model. While being able to provide exact ownership verification, these techniques are 1) invasive, i.e., they need to tamper with the training process, which may affect the model utility or introduce new security risks into the model; 2) prone to adaptive attacks that attempt to remove/replace the watermark or adversarially block the retrieval of the watermark; and 3) not robust to the emerging model extraction attacks. Latest fingerprinting work on deep learning models, though being non-invasive, also falls short when facing the diverse and ever-growing attack scenarios.In this paper, we propose a novel testing framework for deep learning copyright protection: DEEPJUDGE. DEEPJUDGE quantitatively tests the similarities between two deep learning models: a victim model and a suspect model. It leverages a diverse set of testing metrics and efficient test case generation algorithms to produce a chain of supporting evidence to help determine whether a suspect model is a copy of the victim model. Advantages of DEEPJUDGE include: 1) non-invasive, as it works directly on the model and does not tamper with the training process; 2) efficient, as it only needs a small set of seed test cases and a quick scan of the two models; 3) flexible, i.e., it can easily incorporate new testing metrics or test case generation methods to obtain more confident and robust judgement; and 4) fairly robust to model extraction attacks and adaptive attacks. We verify the effectiveness of DEEPJUDGE under three typical copyright infringement scenarios, including model finetuning, pruning and extraction, via extensive experiments on both image classification and speech recognition datasets with a variety of model architectures.",

        "title": "SGUARD: Towards Fixing Vulnerable Smart Contracts Automatically",
        "abstract": "Smart contracts are distributed, self-enforcing programs executing on top of blockchain networks. They have the potential to revolutionize many industries such as financial institutes and supply chains. However, smart contracts are subject to code-based vulnerabilities, which casts a shadow on its applications. As smart contracts are unpatchable (due to the immutability of blockchain), it is essential that smart contracts are guaranteed to be free of vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, smart contract languages such as Solidity are Turing-complete, which implies that verifying them statically is infeasible. Thus, alternative approaches must be developed to provide the guarantee. In this work, we develop an approach which automatically transforms smart contracts so that they are provably free of 4 common kinds of vulnerabilities. The key idea is to apply run-time verification in an efficient and provably correct manner. Experiment results with 5000 smart contracts show that our approach incurs minor run-time overhead in terms of time (i.e., 14.79%) and gas (i.e., 0.79%).",

        "abstract": "Power side-channel attacks exploit variations in power consumption to extract secrets from a device, e.g., cryptographic keys. Prior attacks typically required physical access to the target device and specialized equipment such as probes and a high-resolution oscilloscope.In this paper, we present PLATYPUS attacks, which are novel software-based power side-channel attacks on Intel server, desktop, and laptop CPUs. We exploit unprivileged access to the Intel Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) interface that exposes values directly correlated with power consumption, forming a low-resolution side channel.We show that with sufficient statistical evaluation, we can observe variations in power consumption, which distinguish different instructions and different Hamming weights of operands and memory loads. This enables us to not only monitor the control flow of applications but also to infer data and extract cryptographic keys. We demonstrate how an unprivileged attacker can leak AES-NI keys from Intel SGX and the Linux kernel, break kernel address-space layout randomization (KASLR), infer secret instruction streams, and establish a timing-independent covert channel. We also present a privileged attack on mbed TLS, utilizing precise execution control to recover RSA keys from an SGX enclave. We discuss countermeasures and show that mitigating these attacks in a privileged context is not trivial.",

        "title": "TrollMagnifier: Detecting State-Sponsored Troll Accounts on Reddit",
        "abstract": "Growing evidence points to recurring influence campaigns on social media, often sponsored by state actors aiming to manipulate public opinion on sensitive political topics. Typically, campaigns are performed through instrumented accounts, known as troll accounts; despite their prominence, however, little work has been done to detect these accounts in the wild. In this paper, we present TROLLMAGNIFIER, a detection system for troll accounts. Our key observation, based on analysis of known Russian-sponsored troll accounts identified by Reddit, is that they show loose coordination, often interacting with each other to further specific narratives. Therefore, troll accounts controlled by the same actor often show similarities that can be leveraged for detection. TROLLMAGNIFIER learns the typical behavior of known troll accounts and identifies more that behave similarly. We train TROLLMAGNIFIER on a set of 335 known troll accounts and run it on a large dataset of Reddit accounts. Our system identifies 1,248 potential troll accounts; we then provide a multi-faceted analysis to corroborate the correctness of our classification. In particular, 66% of the detected accounts show signs of being instrumented by malicious actors (e.g., they were created on the same exact day as a known troll, they have since been suspended by Reddit, etc.). They also discuss similar topics as the known troll accounts and exhibit temporal synchronization in their activity. Overall, we show that using TROLLMAGNIFIER, one can grow the initial knowledge of potential trolls provided by Reddit by over 300%.",

        "abstract": "Recovering variables and data structure information from stripped binary is a prominent challenge in binary program analysis. While various state-of-the-art techniques are effective in specific settings, such effectiveness may not generalize. This is mainly because the problem is inherently uncertain due to the information loss in compilation. Most existing techniques are deterministic and lack a systematic way of handling such uncertainty. We propose a novel probabilistic technique for variable and structure recovery. Random variables are introduced to denote the likelihood of an abstract memory location having various types and structural properties such as being a field of some data structure. These random variables are connected through probabilistic constraints derived through program analysis. Solving these constraints produces the posterior probabilities of the random variables, which essentially denote the recovery results. Our experiments show that our technique substantially outperforms a number of state-of-the-art systems, including IDA, Ghidra, Angr, and Howard. Our case studies demonstrate the recovered information improves binary code hardening and binary decompilation.",

        "title": "Bad Characters: Imperceptible NLP Attacks",
        "abstract": "Several years of research have shown that machine-learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples, both in theory and in practice. Until now, such attacks have primarily targeted visual models, exploiting the gap between human and machine perception. Although text-based models have also been attacked with adversarial examples, such attacks struggled to preserve semantic meaning and indistinguishability. In this paper, we explore a large class of adversarial examples that can be used to attack text-based models in a black-box setting without making any human-perceptible visual modification to inputs. We use encoding-specific perturbations that are imperceptible to the human eye to manipulate the outputs of a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems from neural machine-translation pipelines to web search engines. We find that with a single imperceptible encoding injection \u2013 representing one invisible character, homoglyph, reordering, or deletion \u2013 an attacker can significantly reduce the performance of vulnerable models, and with three injections most models can be functionally broken. Our attacks work against currently-deployed commercial systems, including those produced by Microsoft and Google, in addition to open source models published by Facebook, IBM, and HuggingFace. This novel series of attacks presents a significant threat to many language processing systems: an attacker can affect systems in a targeted manner without any assumptions about the underlying model. We conclude that text-based NLP systems require careful input sanitization, just like conventional applications, and that given such systems are now being deployed rapidly at scale, the urgent attention of architects and operators is required.",

        "title": "When LoRa Meets EMR: Electromagnetic Covert Channels Can Be Super Resilient",
        "abstract": "Due to the low power of electromagnetic radiation (EMR), EM convert channel has been widely considered as a short-range attack that can be easily mitigated by shielding. This paper overturns this common belief by demonstrating how covert EM signals leaked from typical laptops, desktops and servers are decoded from hundreds of meters away, or penetrate aggressive shield previously considered as sufficient to ensure emission security. We achieve this by designing EMLoRa \u2013 a super resilient EM covert channel that exploits memory as a LoRa-like radio. EMLoRa represents the first attempt of designing an EM covert channel using state-of-the-art spread spectrum technology. It tackles a set of unique challenges, such as handling complex spectral characteristics of EMR, tolerating signal distortions caused by CPU contention, and preventing adversarial detectors from demodulating covert signals. Experiment results show that EMLoRa boosts communication range by 20x and improves attenuation resilience by up to 53 dB when compared with prior EM covert channels at the same bit rate. By achieving this, EMLoRa allows an attacker to circumvent security perimeter, breach Faraday cage, and localize air-gapped devices in a wide area using just a small number of inexpensive sensors. To countermeasure EMLoRa, we further explore the feasibility of uncovering EMLoRa's signal using energy- and CNN-based detectors. Experiments show that both detectors suffer limited range, allowing EMLoRa to gain a significant range advantage. Our results call for further research on the countermeasure against spread spectrum-based EM covert channels.",

        "abstract": "A standard requirement for a signature scheme is that it is existentially unforgeable under chosen message attacks (EUF-CMA), alongside other properties of interest such as strong unforgeability (SUF-CMA), and resilience against key substitution attacks.Remarkably, no detailed proofs have ever been given for these security properties for EdDSA, and in particular its Ed25519 instantiations. Ed25519 is one of the most efficient and widely used signature schemes, and different instantiations of Ed25519 are used in protocols such as TLS 1.3, SSH, Tor, ZCash, and WhatsApp/Signal. The differences between these instantiations are subtle, and only supported by informal arguments, with many works assuming results can be directly transferred from Schnorr signatures. Similarly, several proofs of protocol security simply assume that Ed25519 satisfies properties such as EUF-CMA or SUF-CMA.In this work we provide the first detailed analysis and security proofs of Ed25519 signature schemes. While the design of the schemes follows the well-established Fiat-Shamir paradigm, which should guarantee existential unforgeability, there are many side cases and encoding details that complicate the proofs, and all other security properties needed to be proven independently.Our work provides scientific rationale for choosing among several Ed25519 variants and understanding their properties, fills a much needed proof gap in modern protocol proofs that use these signatures, and supports further standardisation efforts.",

        "title": "Trouble Over-The-Air: An Analysis of FOTA Apps in the Android Ecosystem",
        "abstract": "Android firmware updates are typically managed by the so-called FOTA (Firmware Over-the-Air) apps. Such apps are highly privileged and play a critical role in maintaining devices secured and updated. The Android operating system offers standard mechanisms\u2014available to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)\u2014to implement their own FOTA apps but such vendor-specific implementations could be a source of security and privacy issues due to poor software engineering practices. This paper performs the first large-scale and systematic analysis of the FOTA ecosystem through a dataset of 2,013 FOTA apps detected with a tool designed for this purpose over 422,121 pre-installed apps. We classify the different stakeholders developing and deploying FOTA apps on the Android update ecosystem, showing that 43% of FOTA apps are developed by third parties. We report that some devices can have as many as 5 apps implementing FOTA capabilities. By means of static analysis of the code of FOTA apps, we show that some apps present behaviors that can be considered privacy intrusive, such as the collection of sensitive user data (e.g., geolocation linked to unique hardware identifiers), and a significant presence of third-party trackers. We also discover implementation issues leading to critical vulnerabilities, such as the use of public AOSP test keys both for signing FOTA apps and for update verification, thus allowing any update signed with the same key to be installed. Finally, we study telemetry data collected from real devices by a commercial security tool. We demonstrate that FOTA apps are responsible for the installation of non-system apps (e.g., entertainment apps and games), including malware and Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUP). Our findings suggest that FOTA development practices are misaligned with Google\u2019s recommendations.",

Here, we elaborate on the formal approach introduced by Bana and Comon in [10], [11], which was originally designed to analyze protocols for a fixed number of sessions, and lacks support for proof mechanization.In this paper, we present a framework and an interactive prover allowing to mechanize proofs of security protocols for an arbitrary number of sessions in the computational model. More specifically, we develop a meta-logic as well as a proof system for deriving security properties. Proofs in our system only deal with high-level, symbolic representations of protocol executions, similar to proofs in the symbolic model, but providing security guarantees at the computational level. We have implemented our approach within a new interactive prover, the Squirrel prover, taking as input protocols specified in the applied pi-calculus, and we have performed a number of case studies covering a variety of primitives (hashes, encryption, signatures, Diffie-Hellman exponentiation) and security properties (authentication, strong secrecy, unlinkability).",

In this systematization work, we present a framework for reasoning about at-risk users based on a wide-ranging meta-analysis of 95 papers. Across the varied populations that we examined (e.g., children, activists, people with disabilities), we identified 10 unifying contextual risk factors \u2014such as marginalization and access to a sensitive resource \u2014that augment or amplify digital-safety risks and their resulting harms. We also identified technical and non-technical practices that at-risk users adopt to attempt to protect themselves from digital-safety risks. We use this framework to discuss barriers that limit at-risk users\u2019 ability or willingness to take protective actions. We believe that researchers and technology creators can use our framework to identify and shape research investments to benefit at-risk users, and to guide technology design to better support at-risk users.",

        "title": "Response-Hiding Encrypted Ranges: Revisiting Security via Parametrized Leakage-Abuse Attacks",
        "abstract": "Despite a growing body of work on leakage-abuse attacks for encrypted databases, attacks on practical response-hiding constructions are yet to appear. Response-hiding constructions are superior in that they nullify access-pattern based attacks by revealing only the search token and the result size of each query. Response-hiding schemes are vulnerable to existing volume attacks, which are, however, based on strong assumptions such as the uniform query assumption or the dense database assumption. More crucially, these attacks only apply to schemes that cannot be deployed in practice (ones with quadratic storage and increased leakage) while practical response-hiding schemes (Demertzis et al. [SIGMOD\u201916] and Faber et al. [ESORICS\u201915]) have linear storage and less leakage. Due to these shortcomings, the value of existing volume attacks on response-hiding schemes is unclear.In this work, we close the aforementioned gap by introducing a parametrized leakage-abuse attack that applies to practical response-hiding structured encryption schemes. The use of non-parametric estimation techniques makes our attack agnostic to both the data and the query distribution. At the very core of our technique lies the newly defined concept of a counting function with respect to a range scheme. We propose a two-phase framework to approximate the counting function for any range scheme. By simply switching one counting function for another, i.e., the so-called \"parameter\" of our modular attack, an adversary can attack different encrypted range schemes. We propose a constrained optimization formulation for the attack algorithm that is based on the counting functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our leakage-abuse attack on synthetic and real-world data under various scenarios.",

        "title": "On the Anonymity Guarantees of Anonymous Proof-of-Stake Protocols",
        "abstract": "In proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains, stakeholders that extend the chain are selected according to the amount of stake they own. In S&P 2019 the \"Ouroboros Crypsinous\" system of Kerber et al. (and concurrently Ganesh et al. in EUROCRYPT 2019) presented a mechanism that hides the identity of the stakeholder when adding blocks, hence preserving anonymity of stakeholders both during payment and mining in the Ouroboros blockchain. They focus on anonymizing the messages of the blockchain protocol, but suggest that potential identity leaks from the network-layer can be removed as well by employing anonymous broadcast channels.In this work we show that this intuition is flawed. Even ideal anonymous broadcast channels do not suffice to protect the identity of the stakeholder who proposes a block.We make the following contributions. First, we show a formal network-attack against Ouroboros Crypsinous, where the adversary can leverage network delays to distinguish who is the stakeholder that added a block on the blockchain. Second, we abstract the above attack and show that whenever the adversary has control over the network delay \u2013 within the synchrony bound \u2013 loss of anonymity is inherent for any protocol that provides liveness guarantees. We do so, by first proving that it is impossible to devise a (deterministic) state-machine replication protocol that achieves basic liveness guarantees and better than (1\u22122f) anonymity at the same time (where f is the fraction of corrupted parties). We then connect this result to the PoS setting by presenting the tagging and reverse tagging attack that allows an adversary, across several executions of the PoS protocol, to learn the stake of a target node, by simply delaying messages for the target. We demonstrate that our assumption on the delaying power of the adversary is realistic by describing how our attack could be mounted over the Zcash blockchain network (even when Tor is used). We conclude by suggesting approaches that can mitigate such attacks.",

        "title": "Android Custom Permissions Demystified: From Privilege Escalation to Design Shortcomings",
        "abstract": "Permission is the fundamental security mechanism for protecting user data and privacy on Android. Given its importance, security researchers have studied the design and usage of permissions from various aspects. However, most of the previous research focused on the security issues of system permissions. Overlooked by many researchers, an app can use custom permissions to share its resources and capabilities with other apps. However, the security implications of using custom permissions have not been fully understood.In this paper, we systematically evaluate the design and implementation of Android custom permissions. Notably, we built an automatic fuzzing tool, called CuPerFuzzer, to detect custom permissions related vulnerabilities existing in the Android OS. CuPerFuzzer treats the operations of the permission mechanism as a black-box and executes massive targeted test cases to trigger privilege escalation. In the experiments, CuPerFuzzer discovered 2,384 effective cases with 30 critical paths successfully. Through investigating these vulnerable cases and analyzing the source code of Android OS, we further identified a series of severe design shortcomings lying in the Android permission framework, including dangling custom permission, inconsistent permission-group mapping, custom permission elevating, and inconsistent permission definition. Exploiting any of these shortcomings, a malicious app can obtain dangeroussystem permissions without user consent and further access unauthorized platform resources. On top of these observations, we propose some general design guidelines to secure custom permissions. Our findings have been acknowledged by the Android security team and rated as High severity.",

Further, we show that DP-Sniper is effective in exploiting floating-point vulnerabilities of naively implemented algorithms: it detects that a supposedly 0.1-differentially private implementation of the Laplace mechanism actually does not satisfy even 0.25-differential privacy.",

        "abstract": "Modern mobile devices feature multiple wireless technologies, such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and LTE. Each of them is implemented within a separate wireless chip, sometimes packaged as combo chips. However, these chips share components and resources, such as the same antenna or wireless spectrum. Wireless coexistence interfaces enable them to schedule packets without collisions despite shared resources, essential to maximizing networking performance. Today\u2019s hardwired coexistence interfaces hinder clear security boundaries and separation between chips and chip components. This paper shows practical coexistence attacks on Broadcom, Cypress, and Silicon Labs chips deployed in billions of devices. For example, we demonstrate that a Bluetooth chip can directly extract network passwords and manipulate traffic on a Wi-Fi chip. Coexistence attacks enable a novel type of lateral privilege escalation across chip boundaries. We responsibly disclosed the vulnerabilities to the vendors. Yet, only partial fixes were released for existing hardware since wireless chips would need to be redesigned from the ground up to prevent the presented attacks on coexistence.",

        "title": "Invisible for both Camera and LiDAR: Security of Multi-Sensor Fusion based Perception in Autonomous Driving Under Physical-World Attacks",
        "abstract": "In Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, perception is both security and safety critical. Despite various prior studies on its security issues, all of them only consider attacks on camera-or LiDAR-based AD perception alone. However, production AD systems today predominantly adopt a Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF) based design, which in principle can be more robust against these attacks under the assumption that not all fusion sources are (or can be) attacked at the same time. In this paper, we present the first study of security issues of MSF-based perception in AD systems. We directly challenge the basic MSF design assumption above by exploring the possibility of attacking all fusion sources simultaneously. This allows us for the first time to understand how much security guarantee MSF can fundamentally provide as a general defense strategy for AD perception.We formulate the attack as an optimization problem to generate a physically-realizable, adversarial 3D-printed object that misleads an AD system to fail in detecting it and thus crash into it. To systematically generate such a physical-world attack, we propose a novel attack pipeline that addresses two main design challenges: (1) non-differentiable target camera and LiDAR sensing systems, and (2) non-differentiable cell-level aggregated features popularly used in LiDAR-based AD perception. We evaluate our attack on MSF algorithms included in representative open-source industry-grade AD systems in real-world driving scenarios. Our results show that the attack achieves over 90% success rate across different object types and MSF algorithms. Our attack is also found stealthy, robust to victim positions, transferable across MSF algorithms, and physical-world realizable after being 3D-printed and captured by LiDAR and camera devices. To concretely assess the end-to-end safety impact, we further perform simulation evaluation and show that it can cause a 100% vehicle collision rate for an industry-grade AD system. We also evaluate and discuss defense strategies.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain has found applications to track ownership of digital assets. Yet, several blockchains were shown vulnerable to network attacks. It is thus crucial for companies to adopt secure blockchains before moving them to production. In this paper, we present Red Belly Blockchain (RBBC), the first secure blockchain whose throughput scales to hundreds of geodistributed consensus participants. To this end, we drastically revisited Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) blockchains through three contributions: (i) defining the Set Byzantine Con-sensus problem of agreeing on a superblock of all proposed blocks instead of a single block; (ii) adopting a fair leaderless design to offer censorship-resistance guaranteeing the commit of correctly requested transactions; (iii) introducing sharded verification to limit the number of signature verifications without hampering security. We evaluate RBBC on up to 1000 VMs of 3 different types, spread across 4 continents, and under attacks. Although its performance is affected by attacks, RBBC scales in that its throughput increases to hundreds of consensus nodes and achieves 30k TPS throughput and 3 second latency on 1000 VMs, hence improving by 3\u00d7 both the latency and the throughput of its closest competitor.",

        "abstract": "Reverse engineers benefit from the presence of identifiers such as function names in a binary, but usually these are removed for release. Training a machine learning model to predict function names automatically is promising but fundamentally hard: unlike words in natural language, most function names occur only once. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing eXtreme Function Labeling (XFL), an extreme multi-label learning approach to selecting appropriate labels for binary functions. XFL splits function names into tokens, treating each as an informative label akin to the problem of tagging texts in natural language. We relate the semantics of binary code to labels through Dexter, a novel function embedding that combines static analysis-based features with local context from the call graph and global context from the entire binary. We demonstrate that XFL/Dexter outperforms the state of the art in function labeling on a dataset of 10,047 binaries from the Debian project, achieving a precision of 83.5%. We also study combinations of XFL with alternative binary embeddings from the literature and show that Dexter consistently performs best for this task. As a result, we demonstrate that binary function labeling can be effectively phrased in terms of multi-label learning, and that binary function embeddings benefit from including explicit semantic features.",

In this paper, we present a novel technique, and its implementation in a tool called SMARTPULSE, for automatically verifying temporal properties in smart contracts. SMARTPULSE is the first smart contract verification tool that is capable of checking liveness properties, which ensure that \"something good\" will eventually happen (e.g., \"I will eventually receive my refund\"). We experimentally evaluate SMARTPULSE on a broad class of smart contracts and properties and show that (a) SMARTPULSE allows automatically verifying important liveness properties, (b) it is competitive with or better than state-of-the-art tools for safety verification, and (c) it can automatically generate attacks for vulnerable contracts.",

        "abstract": "Gun violence results in a significant number of deaths in the United States. Starting in the 1960\u2019s, the US Congress passed a series of gun control laws to regulate the sale and use of firearms. One of the most important but politically fraught gun control measures is a national gun registry. A US Senate office is currently drafting legislation that proposes the creation of a voluntary national gun registration system. At a high level, the bill envisions a decentralized system where local county officials would control and manage the registration data of their constituents. These local databases could then be queried by other officials and law enforcement to trace guns. Due to the sensitive nature of this data, however, these databases should guarantee the confidentiality of the data.In this work, we translate the high-level vision of the proposed legislation into technical requirements and design a crypto- graphic protocol that meets them. Roughly speaking, the protocol can be viewed as a decentralized system of locally-managed end-to-end encrypted databases. Our design relies on various cryptographic building blocks including structured encryption, secure multi-party computation and secret sharing. We propose a formal security definition and prove that our design meets it. We implemented our protocol and evaluated its performance empirically at the scale it would have to run if it were deployed in the United States. Our results show that a decentralized and end-to-end encrypted national gun registry is not only possible in theory but feasible in practice.",

        "title": "Cross-Domain Access Control Encryption: Arbitrary-policy, Constant-size, Efficient",
        "abstract": "Access control is a fundamental keystone in security. Damgard, Haagh, and Orlandi (TCC 2016) introduced access\u02da control encryption (ACE) that enforces no-read and no-write rules without revealing the senders, receivers, or the content of the encrypted traffic. Existing designs of ACE for arbitrary policy (covering all possibilities of read/write relationship) rely on indistinguishability obfuscation or lattice-based assumptions, with either exponential-size ciphertexts or circuit realization of policy. Also, their designs mandate a private sanitizer key to remain perpetually online for sanitization. The only existing scheme that can afford a public sanitizer key supports only simple policies. To summarize, state-of-the-art ACE schemes only feature at most two of the following desirable properties: arbitrarypolicy, constant-size (ciphertext), and efficient (sanitization). This paper introduces an ACE scheme for arbitrary policy without sanitizer key, which solves the open question posed by Kim and Wu (Asiacrypt 2017). We also put forth the notion of cross-domain ACE, separating the key generator into the sender-authority and receiver-authority. Our scheme requires structure-preserving signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, and sanitizable identity-based broadcast encryption as the building blocks. It can be instantiated directly from pairing-based assumptions and features constant ciphertext size. We also prototyped our scheme and demonstrated its practical efficiency.",

        "title": "Lockable Signatures for Blockchains: Scriptless Scripts for All Signatures",
        "abstract": "Payment Channel Networks (PCNs) have given a huge boost to the scalability of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies: Beyond improving the transaction rate, PCNs enabled cheap cross-currency payments and atomic swaps. However, current PCNs proposals either heavily rely on special scripting features of the underlying blockchain (e.g. Hash Time Lock Contracts) or are tailored to a handful of digital signature schemes, such as Schnorr or ECDSA signatures. This leaves us in an unsatisfactory situation where many currencies that are being actively developed and use different signature schemes cannot enjoy the benefits of a PCN.In this work, we investigate whether we can construct PCNs assuming the minimal ability of a blockchain to verify a digital signature, for any signature scheme. In answering this question in the affirmative, we introduce the notion of lockable signatures, which constitutes the cornerstone of our PCN protocols. Our approach is generic and the PCN protocol is compatible with any digital signature scheme, thus inheriting all favorable properties of the underlying scheme that are not offered by Schnorr/ECDSA (e.g. aggregatable signatures or post-quantum security).While the usage of generic cryptographic machinery makes our generic protocol impractical, we view it as an important feasibility result as it may serve as the basis for constructing optimized protocols for specific signature schemes. To substantiate this claim, we design a highly efficient PCN protocol for the special case of Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signatures. BLS signatures enjoy many unique features that make it a viable candidate for a blockchain, e.g. short, unique, and aggregatable signatures. Yet, prior to our work, no PCN was known to be compatible with it (without requiring an advanced scripting language). The cost of our PCN is dominated by a handful of calls to the BLS algorithms. Our concrete evaluation of these basic operations shows that users with commodity hardware can process payments with minimal overhead.",

        "abstract": "Recent transient execution attacks have demonstrated that attackers may leak sensitive information across security boundaries on a shared CPU core. Up until now, it seemed possible to prevent this by isolating potential victims and attackers on separate cores. In this paper, we show that the situation is more serious, as transient execution attacks can leak data across different cores on many modern Intel CPUs.We do so by investigating the behavior of x86 instructions, and in particular, we focus on complex microcoded instructions which perform offcore requests. Combined with transient execution vulnerabilities such as Micro-architectural Data Sampling (MDS), these operations can reveal internal CPU state. Using performance counters, we build a profiler, CROSSTALK, to examine the number and nature of such operations for many x86 instructions, and find that some instructions read data from a staging buffer which is shared between all CPU cores.To demonstrate the security impact of this behavior, we present the first cross-core attack using transient execution, showing that even the seemingly-innocuous CPUID instruction can be used by attackers to sample the entire staging buffer containing sensitive data \u2013 most importantly, output from the hardware random number generator (RNG) \u2013 across cores. We show that this can be exploited in practice to attack SGX enclaves running on a completely different core, where an attacker can control leakage using practical performance degradation attacks, and demonstrate that we can successfully determine enclave private keys. Since existing mitigations which rely on spatial or temporal partitioning are largely ineffective to prevent our proposed attack, we also discuss potential new mitigation techniques.",

        "abstract": "Hacking exercises are a common tool for security education, but there is limited investigation of how they teach security concepts and whether they follow pedagogical best practices. This paper enumerates the pedagogical practices of 31 popular online hacking exercises. Specifically, we derive a set of pedagogical dimensions from the general learning sciences and educational literature, tailored to hacking exercises, and review whether and how each exercise implements each pedagogical dimension. In addition, we interview the organizers of 15 exercises to understand challenges and tradeoffs that may occur when choosing whether and how to implement each dimension.We found hacking exercises generally were tailored to students\u2019 prior security experience and support learning by limiting extraneous load and establishing helpful online communities. Conversely, few exercises explicitly provide overarching conceptual structure or direct support for metacognition to help students transfer learned knowledge to new contexts. Immediate and tailored feedback and secure development practice were also uncommon. Additionally, we observed a tradeoff between providing realistic challenges and burdening students with extraneous cognitive load, with benefits and drawbacks at any point on this axis. Based on our results, we make suggestions for exercise improvement and future work to support organizers.",

        "abstract": "Coarse-grained dynamic information-flow control (IFC) is a good match for imperative object-oriented programming languages such as Java. Java language abstractions align well with coarse-grained IFC concepts, and so Java can be cleanly extended with coarse-grained dynamic IFC without requiring significantly different design patterns or excessive security annotations, and without excessive performance overhead.We present Co-Inflow: an extension of Java with coarse-grained dynamic IFC. By careful design choices and defaults, a programmer typically needs to add very few annotations to a Java program to convert it to a Co-Inflow program with relatively good precision. Additional annotations can improve precision. We achieve this tradeoff between precision and annotation burden by instantiating and specializing recent advances in coarse-grained IFC for a Java-like setting, and by using opaque labeled values: a restriction of labeled values that the Co-Inflow runtime automatically and securely creates and uses.We have captured the essence of Co-Inflow in a middle-weight imperative calculus, and proven that it provides a termination- insensitive non-interference security guarantee. We have a prototype implementation of Co-Inflow and use it to evaluate the precision, usability, and potential performance of Co-Inflow.",

        "abstract": "Efficient zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs for arbitrary boolean or arithmetic circuits have recently attracted much attention. Existing solutions suffer from either significant prover overhead (i.e., high memory usage) or relatively high communication complexity (at least \u03ba bits per gate, for computational security parameter \u03ba). In this paper, we propose a new protocol for constant-round interactive ZK proofs that simultaneously allows for an efficient prover with asymptotically optimal memory usage and significantly lower communication compared to protocols with similar memory efficiency. Specifically:\u2022The prover in our ZK protocol has linear running time and, perhaps more importantly, memory usage linear in the memory needed to evaluate the circuit non-cryptographically. This allows our proof system to scale easily to very large circuits.\u2022for statistical security parameter \u03c1 = 40, our ZK protocol communicates roughly 9 bits/gate for boolean circuits and 2\u20134 field elements/gate for arithmetic circuits over large fields.Using 5 threads, 400 MB of memory, and a 200 Mbps network to evaluate a circuit with hundreds of billions of gates, our implementation (\u03c1 = 40, \u03ba = 128) runs at a rate of 0.45 \u03bcs/gate in the boolean case, and 1.6 \u03bcs/gate for an arithmetic circuit over a 61-bit field.We also present an improved subfield Vector Oblivious Linear Evaluation (sVOLE) protocol with malicious security that is of independent interest.",

Information flow control has long been proposed as a way to achieve compositional security, offering strong guarantees even when combining software from different trust domains. Unfortunately, this appealing story breaks down in the presence of reentrancy attacks. We formalize a general definition of reentrancy and introduce a security condition that allows software modules like smart contracts to protect their key invariants while retaining the expressive power of safe forms of reentrancy. We present a security type system that provably enforces secure information flow; in conjunction with run-time mechanisms, it enforces secure reentrancy even in the presence of unknown code; and it helps locate and correct recent high-profile vulnerabilities.",

        "abstract": "Fringe groups and organizations have a long history of using euphemisms\u2014ordinary-sounding words with a secret meaning\u2014to conceal what they are discussing. Nowadays, one common use of euphemisms is to evade content moderation policies enforced by social media platforms. Existing tools for enforcing policy automatically rely on keyword searches for words on a \"ban list\", but these are notoriously imprecise: even when limited to swearwords, they can still cause embarrassing false positives [1]. When a commonly used ordinary word acquires a euphemistic meaning, adding it to a keyword-based ban list is hopeless: consider \"pot\" (storage container or marijuana?) or \"heater\" (household appliance or firearm?) The current generation of social media companies instead hire staff to check posts manually, but this is expensive, inhumane, and not much more effective. It is usually apparent to a human moderator that a word is being used euphemistically, but they may not know what the secret meaning is, and therefore whether the message violates policy. Also, when a euphemism is banned, the group that used it need only invent another one, leaving moderators one step behind.This paper will demonstrate unsupervised algorithms that, by analyzing words in their sentence-level context, can both detect words being used euphemistically, and identify the secret meaning of each word. Compared to the existing state of the art, which uses context-free word embeddings, our algorithm for detecting euphemisms achieves 30\u2013400% higher detection accuracies of unlabeled euphemisms in a text corpus. Our algorithm for revealing euphemistic meanings of words is the first of its kind, as far as we are aware. In the arms race between content moderators and policy evaders, our algorithms may help shift the balance in the direction of the moderators.",

In this paper, we present a practical static binary analyzer that automatically infers system call types on Windows at scale. We incorporate our analyzer to NtFuzz, a type-aware Windows kernel fuzzing framework. To our knowledge, this is the first practical fuzzing system that utilizes scalable binary analysis on a COTS OS. With NtFuzz, we found 11 previously unknown kernel bugs, and earned $25,000 through the bug bounty program offered by Microsoft. All these results confirm the practicality of our system as a kernel fuzzer.",

We present estimators and confidence intervals for the optimal privacy parameter of a randomized algorithm A, as well as other key variables (such as the \u201cdata-centric privacy level\u201d). Our estimators are based on a local characterization of privacy and in contrast to the related literature avoid the process of \u201cevent selection\u201d - a major obstacle to privacy validation. This makes our methods easy to implement and user-friendly. We show fast convergence rates of the estimators and asymptotic validity of the confidence intervals. An experimental study of various algorithms confirms the efficacy of our approach.",

        "abstract": "App builders commonly use security challenges, a form of step-up authentication, to add security to their apps. However, the ethical implications of this type of architecture has not been studied previously.In this paper, we present a large-scale measurement study of running an existing anti-fraud security challenge, Boxer, in real apps running on mobile devices. We find that although Boxer does work well overall, it is unable to scan effectively on devices that run its machine learning models at less than one frame per second (FPS), blocking users who use inexpensive devices.With the insights from our study, we design Daredevil, a new anti-fraud system for scanning payment cards that works well across the broad range of performance characteristics and hardware configurations found on modern mobile devices. Daredevil reduces the number of devices that run at less than one FPS by an order of magnitude compared to Boxer, providing a more equitable system for fighting fraud.In total, we collect data from 5,085,444 real devices spread across 496 real apps running production software and interacting with real users.",

In this work, we aim to develop a comprehensive systemization for poisoning attacks on FL by enumerating all possible threat models, variations of poisoning, and adversary capabilities. We specifically put our focus on un-targeted poisoning attacks, as we argue that they are significantly relevant to production FL deployments. We present a critical analysis of untargeted poisoning attacks under practical, production FL environments by carefully characterizing the set of realistic threat models and adversarial capabilities. Our findings are rather surprising: contrary to the established belief, we show that FL is highly robust in practice even when using simple, low-cost defenses. We go even further and propose novel, state-of-the-art data and model poisoning attacks, and show via an extensive set of experiments across three benchmark datasets how (in)effective poisoning attacks are in the presence of simple defense mechanisms. We aim to correct previous misconceptions and offer concrete guidelines to conduct more accurate (and more realistic) research on this topic.",

        "title": "Quantifying Blockchain Extractable Value: How dark is the forest?",
        "abstract": "Permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin have excelled at financial services. Yet, opportunistic traders extract monetary value from the mesh of decentralized finance (DeFi) smart contracts through so-called blockchain extractable value (BEV). The recent emergence of centralized BEV relayer portrays BEV as a positive additional revenue source. Because BEV was quantitatively shown to deteriorate the blockchain\u2019s consensus security, BEV relayers endanger the ledger security by incentivizing rational miners to fork the chain. For example, a rational miner with a 10% hashrate will fork Ethereum if a BEV opportunity exceeds 4x the block reward.However, related work is currently missing quantitative in-sights on past BEV extraction to assess the practical risks of BEV objectively. In this work, we allow to quantity the BEV danger by deriving the USD extracted from sandwich attacks, liquidations, and decentralized exchange arbitrage. We estimate that over 32 months, BEV yielded 540.54M USD in profit, divided among 11,289 addresses when capturing 49,691 cryptocurrencies and 60, 830 on-chain markets. The highest BEV instance we find amounts to 4.1MUSD, 616.6x the Ethereum block reward.Moreover, while the practitioner\u2019s community has discussed the existence of generalized trading bots, we are, to our knowledge, the first to provide a concrete algorithm. Our algorithm can replace unconfirmed transactions without the need to understand the victim transactions\u2019 underlying logic, which we estimate to have yielded a profit of 57,037.32 ETH (35.37MUSD) over 32 months of past blockchain data.Finally, we formalize and analyze emerging BEV relay systems, where miners accept BEV transactions from a centralized relay server instead of the peer-to-peer (P2P) network. We find that such relay systems aggravate the consensus layer attacks and therefore further endanger blockchain security.",

        "title": "Merkle2: A Low-Latency Transparency Log System",
        "abstract": "Transparency logs are designed to help users audit untrusted servers. For example, Certificate Transparency (CT) enables users to detect when a compromised Certificate Authority (CA) has issued a fake certificate. Practical state-of-the-art transparency log systems, however, suffer from high monitoring costs when used for low-latency applications. To reduce monitoring costs, such systems often require users to wait an hour or more for their updates to take effect, inhibiting low-latency applications. We propose Merkle2, a transparency log system that supports both efficient monitoring and low-latency updates. To achieve this goal, we construct a new multi-dimensional, authenticated data structure that nests two types of Merkle trees, hence the name of our system, Merkle2. Using this data structure, we then design a transparency log system with efficient monitoring and lookup protocols that enables low-latency updates. In particular, all the operations in Merkle2 are independent of update intervals and are (poly)logarithmic to the number of entries in the log. Merkle2 not only has excellent asymptotics when compared to prior work, but is also efficient in practice. Our evaluation shows that Merkle2 propagates updates in as little as 1 second and can support 100\u00d7 more users than state-of-the-art transparency logs.",
