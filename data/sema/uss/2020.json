        "abstract": "Voice over LTE (VoLTE) is a packet-based telephony service seamlessly integrated into the Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard and deployed by most telecommunication providers in practice. Due to this widespread use, successful attacks against VoLTE can affect a large number of users worldwide. In this work, we introduce R E V O LTE, an attack that exploits an LTE implementation \ufb02aw to recover the contents of an encrypted VoLTE call, hence enabling an adversary to eaves-drop on phone calls. R E V O LTE makes use of a predictable keystream reuse on the radio layer that allows an adversary to decrypt a recorded call with minimal resources. Through a series of preliminary as well as real-world experiments, we successfully demonstrate the feasibility of R E V O LTE and analyze various factors that critically in\ufb02uence our attack in commercial networks. For mitigating the R E V O LTE attack, we propose and discuss short-and long-term countermeasures deployable by providers and equipment vendors.",

        "abstract": "Intra-process memory isolation can improve security by enforcing least-privilege at a \ufb01ner granularity than traditional operating system controls without the context-switch overhead associated with inter -process communication. A single process can be divided into separate components such that memory belonging to one component can only be accessed by the code of that component. Because the process has traditionally been a fundamental security boundary, assigning different levels of trust to components within a process is a fundamental change in secure systems design. However, so far there has been little research on the challenges of securely implementing intra-process isolation on top of existing operating system abstractions. We identify that despite providing strong intra-process memory isolation, existing, general purpose approaches neglect the ways in which the OS makes memory and other intra-process resources accessible through system objects. Using two recently-proposed memory isolation systems, we show that such designs are vulnerable to generic attacks that bypass memory isolation These attacks use the kernel as a confused deputy, taking advantage of existing intended kernel functionality that is agnostic of intra-process isolation. We argue that the root cause stems from a fundamentally different security model between kernel abstractions and user-level, intra-process memory isolation. Finally, we discuss potential mitigations and show that the performance cost of extending a ptrace -based sandbox to prevent the new attacks is high, highlighting the need for more ef\ufb01cient system call interception",

        "abstract": "Differentially private analysis of graphs is widely used for releasing statistics from sensitive graphs while still preserving user privacy. Most existing algorithms however are in a centralized privacy model, where a trusted data curator holds the entire graph. As this model raises a number of privacy and security issues -- such as, the trustworthiness of the curator and the possibility of data breaches, it is desirable to consider algorithms in a more decentralized local model where no server holds the entire graph. \nIn this work, we consider a local model, and present algorithms for counting subgraphs -- a fundamental task for analyzing the connection patterns in a graph -- with LDP (Local Differential Privacy). For triangle counts, we present algorithms that use one and two rounds of interaction, and show that an additional round can significantly improve the utility. For $k$-star counts, we present an algorithm that achieves an order optimal estimation error in the non-interactive local model. We provide new lower-bounds on the estimation error for general graph statistics including triangle counts and $k$-star counts. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on two real datasets, and show that it is indeed possible to accurately estimate subgraph counts in the local differential privacy model.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid growth of mobile devices and WiFi hotspots, security risks arise. In practice, it is critical for administrators of corporate and public wireless networks to identify the type and/or model of devices connected to the network, in order to set access/firewall rules, to check for known vulnerabilities, or to configure IDS accordingly. Mobile devices are not obligated to report their detailed identities when they join a (public) wireless network, while adversaries could easily forge device attributes. In the literature, efforts have been made to utilize features from network traffic for device identification. In this paper, we present OWL, a novel device identification mechanism for both network administrators and normal users. We first extract network traffic features from passively received broadcast and multicast (BC/MC) packets. Embedding representations are learned to model features into six independent and complementary views. We then present a new multi-view wide and deep learning (MvWDL) framework that is optimized on both generalization performance and labelview interaction performance. Meanwhile, a malicious device detection mechanism is designed to assess the inconsistencies across views in the multi-view classifier to identify anomalies. Finally, we demonstrate OWL\u2019s performance through experiments, case studies, and qualitative analysis.",

        "abstract": "Misconfigurations and outdated software are a major cause of compromised websites and data leaks. Past research has proposed and evaluated sending automated security notifications to the operators of misconfigured websites, but encountered issues with reachability, mistrust, and a perceived lack of importance. In this paper, we seek to understand the determinants of effective notifications. We identify a data protection misconfiguration that affects 12.7 % of the 1.3 million websites we scanned and opens them up to legal liability. Using a subset of 4754 websites, we conduct a multivariate randomized controlled notification experiment, evaluating contact medium, sender, and framing of the message. We also include a link to a public web-based self-service tool that is run by us in disguise and conduct an anonymous survey of the notified website owners (N=477) to understand their perspective. \nWe find that framing a misconfiguration as a problem of legal compliance can increase remediation rates, especially when the notification is sent as a letter from a legal research group, achieving remediation rates of 76.3 % compared to 33.9 % for emails sent by computer science researchers warning about a privacy issue. Across all groups, 56.6 % of notified owners remediated the issue, compared to 9.2 % in the control group. In conclusion, we present factors that lead website owners to trust a notification, show what framing of the notification brings them into action, and how they can be supported in remediating the issue.",

A great deal of e \ufb00 ort is devoted to getting users to follow this advice. Surprisingly then, little is known about the quality of this advice: Is it comprehensible? Is it actionable? Is it e \ufb00 ective? To answer these questions, we \ufb01rst conduct a large-scale, user-driven measurement study to identify 374 unique recommended behaviors contained within 1,264 documents of online security and privacy advice. Second, we develop and validate measurement approaches for evaluating the quality \u2013 comprehensibility, perceived actionability, and perceived e \ufb03 cacy \u2013 of security advice. Third, we deploy these measurement approaches to evaluate the 374 unique pieces of security advice in a user-study with 1,586 users and 41 professional security experts. Our results suggest a crisis of advice prioritization. The majority of advice is perceived by the most users to be at least somewhat actionable, and somewhat comprehensible. Yet, both users and experts struggle to prioritize this advice. For example, experts perceive 89% of the hundreds of studied behaviors as being e \ufb00 ective, and identify 118 of them as being among the \u201ctop 5\u201d things users should do, leaving end-users on their own to prioritize and take action to protect themselves.",

        "abstract": "Smart contract security has drawn much attention due to many severe incidents with huge ether and token losses. As a consequence, researchers have proposed to detect smart contract vulnerabilities via code analysis. However, code analysis only shows what contracts can be attacked, but not what have been attacked, and more importantly, what attacks have been prevented in the real world. In this paper, we present the \ufb01rst comprehensive measurement study to analyze real-world attacks and defenses adopted in the wild based on the transaction logs produced by unin-strumented Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Speci\ufb01cally, our study decouples two important factors of an adversarial transaction\u2014i.e., (i) an adversarial action exploiting the vulnerable contract and (ii) an adversarial consequence like ether or token transfers resulted from the action\u2014for the analysis of attacks and defenses. The results of our study reveal a huge volume of attacks beyond what have been studied in the literature, e.g., those targeting new vulnerability types like airdrop hunting and those targeting zero-day variants of known vulnerabilities. Besides successful attacks, our study also shows attempted attacks that are prevented due to the deployments of defenses. As the nature of cyber-security, those defenses have also been evaded, mainly due to incomplete defense deployments. To summarize it, we believe that this is an ever-evolving game between adversaries obtaining illegal pro\ufb01ts and defenders shielding their own contracts.",

        "abstract": "Abusers increasingly use spyware apps, account compromise, and social engineering to surveil their intimate partners, causing substantial harms that can culminate in violence. This form of privacy violation, termed intimate partner surveillance (IPS), is a profoundly challenging problem to address due to the physical access and trust present in the relationship between the target and attacker. While previous research has examined IPS from the perspectives of survivors, we present the first measurement study of online forums in which (potential) attackers discuss IPS strategies and techniques. In domains such as cybercrime, child abuse, and human trafficking, studying the online behaviors of perpetrators has led to better threat intelligence and techniques to combat attacks. We aim to provide similar insights in the context of IPS. We identified five online forums containing discussion of monitoring cellphones and other means of surveilling an intimate partner, including three within the context of investigating relationship infidelity. We perform a mixed-methods analysis of these forums, surfacing the tools and tactics that attackers use to perform surveillance. Via qualitative analysis of forum content, we present a taxonomy of IPS strategies used and recommended by attackers, and synthesize lessons for technologists seeking to curb the spread of IPS.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of camera-based assistive technologies has empowered people with visual impairments (VIP) to obtain independence in their daily lives. Popular services feature volunteers who answer questions about photos or videos (e.g., to identify a medical prescription). However, people with VIPs can (inadvertently) reveal sensitive information to these volunteers. To better understand the privacy concerns regarding the disclosure of background objects to different types of human assistants (friends, family, and others), we conducted an online survey with 155 visually impaired participants. In general, our participants had varying concerns depending on the type of assistants and the kind of information. We found that our participants were more concerned about the privacy of bystanders than their own when capturing people in images. We also found that participants were concerned about self-presentation and were more comfortable sharing embar-rassing information with family than with their friends. Our \ufb01ndings suggest directions for future work in the development of human-assisted question-answering systems. Speci\ufb01cally, we discuss how humanizing these systems can give people a greater sense of personal security.",

        "abstract": "We propose a new class of signal injection attacks on microphones by physically converting light to sound. We show how an attacker can inject arbitrary audio signals to a target microphone by aiming an amplitude-modulated light at the microphone's aperture. We then proceed to show how this effect leads to a remote voice-command injection attack on voice-controllable systems. Examining various products that use Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Facebook's Portal, and Google Assistant, we show how to use light to obtain control over these devices at distances up to 110 meters and from two separate buildings. Next, we show that user authentication on these devices is often lacking, allowing the attacker to use light-injected voice commands to unlock the target's smartlock-protected front doors, open garage doors, shop on e-commerce websites at the target's expense, or even unlock and start various vehicles connected to the target's Google account (e.g., Tesla and Ford). Finally, we conclude with possible software and hardware defenses against our attacks.",

        "abstract": "For high-level Autonomous Vehicles (AV), localization is highly security and safety critical. One direct threat to it is GPS spoofing, but fortunately, AV systems today predominantly use Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF) algorithms that are generally believed to have the potential to practically defeat GPS spoofing. However, no prior work has studied whether today's MSF algorithms are indeed sufficiently secure under GPS spoofing, especially in AV settings. In this work, we perform the first study to fill this critical gap. As the first study, we focus on a production-grade MSF with both design and implementation level representativeness, and identify two AV-specific attack goals, off-road and wrong-way attacks. \nTo systematically understand the security property, we first analyze the upper-bound attack effectiveness, and discover a take-over effect that can fundamentally defeat the MSF design principle. We perform a cause analysis and find that such vulnerability only appears dynamically and non-deterministically. Leveraging this insight, we design FusionRipper, a novel and general attack that opportunistically captures and exploits take-over vulnerabilities. We evaluate it on 6 real-world sensor traces, and find that FusionRipper can achieve at least 97% and 91.3% success rates in all traces for off-road and wrong-way attacks respectively. We also find that it is highly robust to practical factors such as spoofing inaccuracies. To improve the practicality, we further design an offline method that can effectively identify attack parameters with over 80% average success rates for both attack goals, with the cost of at most half a day. We also discuss promising defense directions.",

        "title": "The Impact of Ad-Blockers on Product Search and Purchase Behavior: A Lab Experiment",
        "abstract": ". Ad-blocking applications have become increasingly popular among Internet users. Ad-blockers offer various privacy- and security-enhancing features: they can reduce personal data collection and exposure to malicious advertising, help safeguard users' decision-making autonomy, reduce users' costs (by increasing the speed of page loading), and improve the browsing experience (by reducing visual clutter). On the other hand, the online advertising industry has claimed that ads increase consumers' economic welfare by helping them find better, cheaper deals faster. If so, using ad-blockers would deprive consumers of these benefits. However, little is known about the actual economic impact of ad-blockers. We designed a lab experiment (N=212) with real economic incentives to understand the impact of ad-blockers on consumers' product searching and purchasing behavior, and the resulting consumer outcomes. We focus on the effects of blocking contextual ads (ads targeted to individual, potentially sensitive, contexts, such as search queries in a search engine or the content of web pages) on how participants searched for and purchased various products online, and the resulting consumer welfare. We find that blocking contextual ads did not have a statistically significant effect on the prices of products participants chose to purchase, the time they spent searching for them, or how satisfied they were with the chosen products, prices, and perceived quality. Hence we do not reject the null hypothesis that consumer behavior and outcomes stay constant when such ads are blocked or shown. We conclude that the use of ad-blockers does not seem to compromise consumer economic welfare (along the metrics captured in the experiment) in exchange for privacy and security benefits. We discuss the implications of this work in terms of end-users' privacy, the study's limitations, and future work to extend these results.Presented at the 29th USENIX Security Symposium, August 12-14, 2020",

        "title": "Mind Your Weight(s): A Large-scale Study on Insufficient Machine Learning Model Protection in Mobile Apps",
        "abstract": "On-device machine learning (ML) is quickly gaining popularity among mobile apps. It allows offline model inference while preserving user privacy. However, ML models, considered as core intellectual properties of model owners, are now stored on billions of untrusted devices and subject to potential thefts. Leaked models can cause both severe financial loss and security consequences. \nThis paper presents the first empirical study of ML model protection on mobile devices. Our study aims to answer three open questions with quantitative evidence: How widely is model protection used in apps? How robust are existing model protection techniques? How much can (stolen) models cost? To that end, we built a simple app analysis pipeline and analyzed 46,753 popular apps collected from the US and Chinese app markets. We identified 1,468 ML apps spanning all popular app categories. We found that, alarmingly, 41% of ML apps do not protect their models at all, which can be trivially stolen from app packages. Even for those apps that use model protection or encryption, we were able to extract the models from 66% of them via unsophisticated dynamic analysis techniques. The extracted models are mostly commercial products and used for face recognition, liveness detection, ID/bank card recognition, and malware detection. We quantitatively estimated the potential financial impact of a leaked model, which can amount to millions of dollars for different stakeholders. \nOur study reveals that on-device models are currently at high risk of being leaked; attackers are highly motivated to steal such models. Drawn from our large-scale study, we report our insights into this emerging security problem and discuss the technical challenges, hoping to inspire future research on robust and practical model protection for mobile devices.",

        "abstract": "We demonstrate the feasibility of database reconstruction under a cache side-channel attack on SQLite. Specifically, we present a Flush+Reload attack on SQLite that obtains approximate (or \"noisy\") volumes of range queries made to a private database. We then present several algorithms that, taken together, reconstruct nearly the exact database in varied experimental conditions, given these approximate volumes. Our reconstruction algorithms employ novel techniques for the approximate/noisy setting, including a noise-tolerant clique-finding algorithm, a \"Match & Extend\" algorithm for extrapolating volumes that are omitted from the clique, and a \"Noise Reduction Step\" that makes use of a closest vector problem (CVP) solver to improve the overall accuracy of the reconstructed database. The time complexity of our attacks grows quickly with the size of the range of the queried attribute, but scales well to large databases. Experimental results show that we can reconstruct databases of size 100,000 and ranges of size 12 with error percentage of 0.22 % in under 12 hours on a personal laptop.",

        "title": "Walking Onions: Scaling Anonymity Networks while Protecting Users",
        "abstract": "Scaling anonymity networks offers unique security challenges, as attackers can exploit differing views of the network\u2019s topology to perform epistemic and route capture attacks. Anonymity networks in practice, such as Tor, have opted for security over scalability by requiring participants to share a globally consistent view of all relays to prevent these kinds of attacks. Such an approach requires each user to maintain up-to-date information about every relay, causing the total amount of data each user must download every epoch to scale linearly with the number of relays. As the number of clients increases, more relays must be added to provide bandwidth, further exacerbating the total load on the network. In this work, we present Walking Onions , a set of protocols improving scalability for anonymity networks. Walking Onions enables constant-size scaling of the information each user must download in every epoch, even as the number of relays in the network grows. Furthermore, we show how relaxing the clients\u2019 bandwidth growth from constant to logarithmic can enable an outsized improvement to relays\u2019 bandwidth costs. Notably, Walking Onions offers the same security properties as current designs that require a globally consistent network view. We present two protocol variants. The \ufb01rst requires minimal changes from current onion-routing systems. The second presents a more signi\ufb01cant design change, thereby reducing the latency required to establish a path through the network while providing better forward secrecy than previous such constructions. We implement and evaluate Walking Onions in a simulated onion-routing anonymity network modelled after Tor, and validate that Walking Onions indeed offers signi\ufb01cant scalability improvements for networks at or above the size of the current Tor network.",

        "abstract": "Synthetic data has been advertised as a silver-bullet solution to privacy-preserving data publishing that addresses the shortcomings of traditional anonymisation techniques. The promise is that synthetic data drawn from generative models preserves the statistical properties of the original dataset but, at the same time, provides perfect protection against privacy attacks. In this work, we present the first quantitative evaluation of the privacy gain of synthetic data publishing and compare it to that of previous anonymisation techniques. Our evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art generative models demonstrates that synthetic data either does not prevent inference attacks or does not retain data utility. In other words, we empirically show that synthetic data does not provide a better tradeoff between privacy and utility than traditional anonymisation techniques. Furthermore, in contrast to traditional anonymisation, the privacy-utility tradeoff of synthetic data publishing is hard to predict. Because it is impossible to predict what signals a synthetic dataset will preserve and what information will be lost, synthetic data leads to a highly variable privacy gain and unpredictable utility loss. In summary, we find that synthetic data is far from the holy grail of privacy-preserving data publishing.",

        "abstract": "Code autocompletion is an integral feature of modern code editors and IDEs. The latest generation of autocompleters uses neural language models, trained on public open-source code repositories, to suggest likely (not just statically feasible) completions given the current context. \nWe demonstrate that neural code autocompleters are vulnerable to data- and model-poisoning attacks. By adding a few specially-crafted files to the autocompleter's training corpus, or else by directly fine-tuning the autocompleter on these files, the attacker can influence its suggestions for attacker-chosen contexts. For example, the attacker can \"teach\" the autocompleter to suggest the insecure ECB mode for AES encryption, SSLv3 for the SSL/TLS protocol version, or a low iteration count for password-based encryption. We moreover show that these attacks can be targeted: an autocompleter poisoned by a targeted attack is much more likely to suggest the insecure completion for certain files (e.g., those from a specific repo). \nWe quantify the efficacy of targeted and untargeted data- and model-poisoning attacks against state-of-the-art autocompleters based on Pythia and GPT-2. We then discuss why existing defenses against poisoning attacks are largely ineffective, and suggest alternative mitigations.",

        "abstract": "Recent Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) schemes enable secure searching over an encrypted database stored in a server while limiting the information leaked to the server. These schemes focus on hiding the access pattern, which refers to the set of documents that match the client's queries. This provides protection against current attacks that largely depend on this leakage to succeed. However, most SSE constructions also leak whether or not two queries aim for the same keyword, also called the search pattern. \nIn this work, we show that search pattern leakage can severely undermine current SSE defenses. We propose an attack that leverages both access and search pattern leakage, as well as some background and query distribution information, to recover the keywords of the queries performed by the client. Our attack follows a maximum likelihood estimation approach, and is easy to adapt against SSE defenses that obfuscate the access pattern. We empirically show that our attack is efficient, it outperforms other proposed attacks, and it completely thwarts two out of the three defenses we evaluate it against, even when these defenses are set to high privacy regimes. These findings highlight that hiding the search pattern, a feature that most constructions are lacking, is key towards providing practical privacy guarantees in SSE.",

        "title": "EPIC: Every Packet Is Checked in the Data Plane of a Path-Aware Internet",
        "abstract": "An exciting insight of recent networking research has been that path-aware networking architectures are able to fundamentally solve many of the security issues of today\u2019s Internet, while increasing overall efficiency and giving control over path selection to end hosts. In this paper, we consider three important issues related to this new networking paradigm: First, network operators still need to be able to impose their own policies to rule out uneconomical paths and to enforce these decisions on the data plane. Second, end hosts should be able to verify that their forwarding decisions are actually followed by the network. Finally, both intermediate routers and recipients should be able to authenticate the source of packets. These properties have been considered by previous work, but there is no existing system that achieves both strong security guarantees and high efficiency. We propose EPIC, a family of data-plane protocols that provide increasingly strong security properties, addressing all three described requirements. The EPIC protocols have significantly lower communication overhead than comparable systems: for realistic path lengths, the overhead is 3\u20135 times smaller compared to the state-of-the-art systems OPT and ICING. Our prototype implementation is able to saturate a 40 Gbps link even on commodity hardware due to the use of only few highly efficient symmetric cryptographic operations in the forwarding process. Thus, by ensuring that every packet is checked at every hop, we make an important step towards an efficient and secure future Internet.",

        "title": "SLAP: Improving Physical Adversarial Examples with Short-Lived Adversarial Perturbations",
        "abstract": "Whilst significant research effort into adversarial examples (AE) has emerged in recent years, the main vector to realize these attacks in the real-world currently relies on static adversarial patches, which are limited in their conspicuousness and can not be modified once deployed. In this paper, we propose Short-Lived Adversarial Perturbations (SLAP), a novel technique that allows adversaries to realize robust, dynamic real-world AE from a distance. As we show in this paper, such attacks can be achieved using a light projector to shine a specifically crafted adversarial image in order to perturb real-world objects and transform them into AE. This allows the adversary greater control over the attack compared to adversarial patches: (i) projections can be dynamically turned on and off or modified at will, (ii) projections do not suffer from the locality constraint imposed by patches, making them harder to detect. We study the feasibility of SLAP in the self-driving scenario, targeting both object detector and traffic sign recognition tasks. We demonstrate that the proposed method generates AE that are robust to different environmental conditions for several networks and lighting conditions: we successfully cause misclassifications of state-of-the-art networks such as Yolov3 and Mask-RCNN with up to 98% success rate for a variety of angles and distances. Additionally, we demonstrate that AE generated with SLAP can bypass SentiNet, a recent AE detection method which relies on the fact that adversarial patches generate highly salient and localized areas in the input images.",

        "abstract": "Current formal approaches have been successfully used to find design flaws in many security protocols. However, it is still challenging to automatically analyze protocols due to their large or infinite state spaces. In this paper, we propose SmartVerif, a novel and general framework that pushes the limit of automation capability of state-of-the-art verification approaches. The primary technical contribution is the dynamic strategy inside SmartVerif, which can be used to smartly search proof paths. Different from the non-trivial and error-prone design of existing static strategies, the design of our dynamic strategy is simple and flexible: it can automatically optimize itself according to the security protocols without any human intervention. With the optimized strategy, SmartVerif can localize and prove supporting lemmata, which leads to higher probability of success in verification. The insight of designing the strategy is that the node representing a supporting lemma is on an incorrect proof path with lower probability, when a random strategy is given. Hence, we implement the strategy around the insight by introducing a reinforcement learning algorithm. We also propose several methods to deal with other technical problems in implementing SmartVerif. Experimental results show that SmartVerif can automatically verify all security protocols studied in this paper. The case studies also validate the efficiency of our dynamic strategy.",

        "abstract": "The Noise specification describes how to systematically construct a large family of Diffie-Hellman based key exchange protocols, including the secure transports used by WhatsApp, Lightning, and WireGuard. As the specification only makes informal security claims, earlier work has explored which formal security properties may be enjoyed by protocols in the Noise framework, yet many important questions remain open. In this work we provide the most comprehensive, systematic analysis of the Noise framework to date. We start from first principles and, using an automated analysis tool, compute the strongest threat model under which a protocol is secure, thus enabling formal comparison between protocols. Our results allow us to objectively and automatically associate each informal security level presented in the Noise specification with a formal security claim. We also provide a fine-grained separation of Noise protocols that were previously described as offering similar security properties, revealing a subclass for which alternative Noise protocols exist that offer strictly better security guarantees. Our analysis also uncovers missing assumptions in the Noise specification and some surprising consequences, e.g., in some situations higher security levels yield strictly worse security.",

        "abstract": "Hardware enclaves are designed to execute small pieces of sensitive code or to operate on sensitive data, in isolation from larger, less trusted systems. Partitioning a large, legacy application requires signi\ufb01cant effort. Partitioning an application written in a managed language, such as Java, is more challenging because of mutable language characteristics, extensive code reachability in class libraries, and the inevitability of using a heavyweight runtime. Civet is a framework for partitioning Java applications into enclaves. Civet reduces the number of lines of code in the enclave and uses language-level defenses, including deep type checks and dynamic taint-tracking, to harden the enclave interface. Civet also contributes a partitioned Java runtime de-sign, including a garbage collection design optimized for the peculiarities of enclaves. Civet is ef\ufb01cient for data-intensive workloads; partitioning a Hadoop mapper reduces the en-clave overhead from 10 \u00d7 to 16\u201322% without taint-tracking or 70\u201380% with taint-tracking.",

Technically, such data \ufb02ows are not \u201cleaks\u201d if they are disclosed in a privacy policy. To address this limitation in automated analysis, recent work has combined program analysis of applications with analysis of privacy policies to determine the \ufb02ow-to-policy consistency, and hence violations thereof. However, this prior work has a fundamental weakness: it does not differentiate the entity (e.g., \ufb01rst-party vs. third-party) receiving the privacy-sensitive data. In this paper, we propose P OLI C HECK , which formalizes and implements an entity-sensitive \ufb02ow-to-policy consistency model. We use P OLI C HECK to study 13,796 applications and their privacy policies and \ufb01nd that up to 42.4% of applications either incorrectly disclose or omit disclosing their privacy-sensitive data \ufb02ows. Our results also demonstrate the signi\ufb01cance of considering entities: without considering entity, prior approaches would falsely classify up to 38.4% of applications as having privacy-sensitive data \ufb02ows consistent with their privacy policies. These false classi\ufb01cations include data \ufb02ows to third-parties that are omitted (e.g., the policy states only the \ufb01rst-party collects the data type), incorrect (e.g., the policy states the third-party does not collect the data type), and ambiguous (e.g., the policy has con\ufb02icting statements about the data type collection).

        "abstract": "Machine learning has made remarkable progress in the last years, yet its success has been overshadowed by different attacks that can thwart its correct operation. While a large body of research has studied attacks against learning algorithms, vulnerabilities in the preprocessing for machine learning have received little attention so far. An exception is the recent work of Xiao et al. that proposes attacks against image scaling. In contrast to prior work, these attacks are agnostic to the learning algorithm and thus impact the majority of learning-based approaches in computer vision. The mechanisms underlying the attacks, however, are not understood yet, and hence their root cause remains unknown. In this paper, we provide the first in-depth analysis of image-scaling attacks. We theoretically analyze the attacks from the perspective of signal processing and identify their root cause as the interplay of downsampling and convolution. Based on this finding, we investigate three popular imaging libraries for machine learning (OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Pillow) and confirm the presence of this interplay in different scaling algorithms. As a remedy, we develop a novel defense against image-scaling attacks that prevents all possible attack variants. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of this defense against non-adaptive and adaptive adversaries.",

        "abstract": "Many users implicitly assume that software can only be exploited after it is installed. However, recent supply-chain attacks demonstrate that application integrity must be ensured during installation itself. We introduce SIGL, a new tool for detecting malicious behavior during software installation. SIGL collects traces of system call activity, building a data provenance graph that it analyzes using a novel autoencoder architecture with a graph long short-term memory network (graph LSTM) for the encoder and a standard multilayer perceptron for the decoder. SIGL flags suspicious installations as well as the specific installation-time processes that are likely to be malicious. Using a test corpus of 625 malicious installers containing real-world malware, we demonstrate that SIGL has a detection accuracy of 96%, outperforming similar systems from industry and academia by up to 87% in precision and recall and 45% in accuracy. We also demonstrate that SIGL can pinpoint the processes most likely to have triggered malicious behavior, works on different audit platforms and operating systems, and is robust to training data contamination and adversarial attack. It can be used with application-specific models, even in the presence of new software versions, as well as application-agnostic meta-models that encompass a wide range of applications and installers.",

Counterfeit parts, which are primarily recycled, test rejects, or legitimate but regraded, have to date been found in a number of systems, including critical defense systems. In this work, we present COUNTERFOIL \u2013 an anti-counterfeiting system based on enrolling and authenticating intrinsic features of the molded packages that enclose a majority of semiconductor chips sold on the market. Our system relies on computer-readable labels, inexpensive cameras, imaging processing using OpenCV, and digital signatures, to enroll and verify chip packages. We demonstrate our approach on a dataset from over 100 chips. Our method is able to authenticate chips within 150ms, which makes it suitable for real-time use in pick-and-place machines. We show that our technique is effective and reliable for verifying provenance under a variety of settings, and evaluate the robustness of the package features by using different imaging platforms, and by wearing the chips with silicon carbide polishing grit in a rock tumbler. We show that, even if an adversary steals the exact mold used to produce an enrolled chip package, he will have limited success in being able to counterfeit the chip.",

        "title": "MUZZ: Thread-aware Grey-box Fuzzing for Effective Bug Hunting in Multithreaded Programs",
        "abstract": "Grey-box fuzz testing has revealed thousands of vulnerabilities in real-world software owing to its lightweight instrumentation, fast coverage feedback, and dynamic adjusting strategies. However, directly applying grey-box fuzzing to input-dependent multithreaded programs can be extremely inefficient. In practice, multithreading-relevant bugs are usually buried in sophisticated program flows. Meanwhile, the existing grey-box fuzzing techniques do not stress thread-interleavings which affect execution states in multithreaded programs. Therefore, mainstream grey-box fuzzers cannot effectively test problematic segments in multithreaded programs despite they might obtain high code coverage statistics. \nTo this end, we propose MUZZ, a new grey-box fuzzing technique that hunts for bugs in multithreaded programs. MUZZ owns three novel thread-aware instrumentations, namely coverage-oriented instrumentation, thread-context instrumentation, and schedule-intervention instrumentation. During fuzzing, these instrumentations engender runtime feedback to stress execution states caused by thread interleavings. By leveraging the feedback in the dynamic seed selection and execution strategies, MUZZ preserves more valuable seeds that expose bugs in a multithreading context. \nWe evaluate MUZZ on 12 real-world software programs. Experiments show that MUZZ outperforms AFL in both multithreading-relevant seed generation and concurrency-vulnerability detection. Further, by replaying the target programs against the generated seeds, MUZZ also reveals more concurrency-bugs (e.g., data-races, thread-leaks) than AFL. In total, MUZZ detected 8 new concurrency-vulnerabilities and 19 new concurrency-bugs. At the time of writing, 4 CVE IDs have been assigned to the reported issues.",

        "abstract": "We introduce a new timing side-channel attack on Intel CPU processors. Our Frontal attack exploits the way that CPU frontend fetches and processes instructions while being interrupted. In particular, we observe that in modern Intel CPUs, some instruction's execution times will depend on which operations precede and succeed them, and on their virtual addresses. Unlike previous attacks that could only profile branches if they contained different code or were based on conditional jumps, the attack allows the adversary to distinguish between instruction-wise identical branches. As the attack requires OS capabilities to set the interrupts, we use it to exploit SGX enclaves. Our attack demonstrates that a realistic SGX attacker can always observe the full enclave instruction trace, and secret-depending branching should not be used even alongside defenses to current controlled-channel attacks. We show that the adversary can use the Frontal attack to extract a secret from an SGX enclave if that secret was used as a branching condition for two instruction-wise identical branches. The attack can be exploited against several crypto libraries and affects all Intel CPUs.",

        "abstract": "VirusTotal provides malware labels from a large set of anti-malware engines, and is heavily used by researchers for malware annotation and system evaluation. Since different engines often disagree with each other, researchers have used various methods to aggregate their labels. In this paper, we take a data-driven approach to categorize, reason, and validate common labeling methods used by researchers. We \ufb01rst survey 115 academic papers that use VirusTotal, and identify common methodologies. Then we collect the daily snapshots of VirusTotal labels for more than 14,000 \ufb01les (including a subset of manually veri\ufb01ed ground-truth) from 65 VirusTotal engines over a year. Our analysis validates the bene\ufb01ts of threshold-based label aggregation in stabilizing \ufb01les\u2019 labels, and also points out the impact of poorly-chosen thresholds. We show that hand-picked \u201ctrusted\u201d engines do not always perform well, and certain groups of engines are strongly correlated and should not be treated independently. Finally, we empirically show certain engines fail to perform in-depth analysis on submitted \ufb01les and can easily produce false positives. Based on our \ufb01ndings, we offer suggestions for future usage of VirusTotal for data annotation.",

        "title": "PARTEMU: Enabling Dynamic Analysis of Real-World TrustZone Software Using Emulation",
        "abstract": "ARM\u2019s TrustZone technology is the basis for security of billions of devices worldwide, including Android smartphones and IoT devices. Because TrustZone has access to sensitive information such as cryptographic keys, access to TrustZone has been locked down on real-world devices: only code that is authenticated by a trusted party can run in TrustZone. A side-effect is that TrustZone software cannot be instrumented or monitored. Thus, recent advances in dynamic analysis techniques such as feedback-driven fuzz testing have not been applied to TrustZone software. To address the above problem, this work builds an emulator that runs four widely-used, real-world TrustZone operating systems (TZOSes) - Qualcomm\u2019s QSEE, Trustonic\u2019s Kinibi, Samsung\u2019s TEEGRIS, and Linaro\u2019s OP-TEE - and the trusted applications (TAs) that run on them. The traditional challenge for this approach is that the emulation effort required is often impractical. However, we \ufb01nd that TZOSes depend only on a limited subset of hardware and software components. By carefully choosing a subset of components to emulate, we \ufb01nd we are able to make the effort practical. We implement our emulation on P ART E MU , a modular framework we develop on QEMU and PANDA. We show the utility of P ART E MU by integrating feedback-driven fuzz-testing us-ing AFL and use it to perform a large-scale study of 194 unique TAs from 12 different Android smartphone vendors and a leading IoT vendor, \ufb01nding previously unknown vulnerabilities in 48 TAs, several of which are exploitable. We identify patterns of developer mistakes unique to TrustZone development that cause some of these vulnerabilities, high-lighting the need for TrustZone-speci\ufb01c developer education. We also demonstrate using P ART E MU to test the QSEE TZOS itself, \ufb01nding crashes in code paths that would not normally be exercised on a real device. Our work shows that dynamic analysis of real-world TrustZone software through emulation is both feasible and bene\ufb01cial.",

        "abstract": "Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) local and remote attestation mechanisms enable an enclave to attest its identity (i.e., the enclave measurement, which is the cryptographic hash of its initial code and data) to an enclave. To verify that the attested identity is trusted, one enclave usually includes the measurement of the enclave it trusts into its initial data in advance assuming no trusted third parties are available during runtime to provide this piece of information. However, when mutual trust between these two enclaves is required, it is infeasible to simultaneously include into their own initial data the other's measurements respectively as any change to the initial data will change their measurements, making the previously included measurements invalid. In this paper, we propose MAGE, a framework enabling a group of enclaves to mutually attest each other without trusted third parties. Particularly, we introduce a technique to instrument these enclaves so that each of them could derive the others' measurements using information solely from its own initial data. We also provide a prototype implementation based on Intel SGX SDK, to facilitate enclave developers to adopt this technique.",

        "title": "CURE: A Security Architecture with CUstomizable and Resilient Enclaves",
        "abstract": "Security architectures providing Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have been an appealing research subject for a wide range of computer systems, from low-end embedded devices to powerful cloud servers. The goal of these architectures is to protect sensitive services in isolated execution contexts, called enclaves. Unfortunately, existing TEE solutions suffer from significant design shortcomings. First, they follow a one-size-fits-all approach offering only a single enclave type, however, different services need flexible enclaves that can adjust to their demands. Second, they cannot efficiently support emerging applications (e.g., Machine Learning as a Service), which require secure channels to peripherals (e.g., accelerators), or the computational power of multiple cores. Third, their protection against cache side-channel attacks is either an afterthought or impractical, i.e., no fine-grained mapping between cache resources and individual enclaves is provided. \nIn this work, we propose CURE, the first security architecture, which tackles these design challenges by providing different types of enclaves: (i) sub-space enclaves provide vertical isolation at all execution privilege levels, (ii) user-space enclaves provide isolated execution to unprivileged applications, and (iii) self-contained enclaves allow isolated execution environments that span multiple privilege levels. Moreover, CURE enables the exclusive assignment of system resources, e.g., peripherals, CPU cores, or cache resources to single enclaves. CURE requires minimal hardware changes while significantly improving the state of the art of hardware-assisted security architectures. We implemented CURE on a RISC-V-based SoC and thoroughly evaluated our prototype in terms of hardware and performance overhead. CURE imposes a geometric mean performance overhead of 15.33% on standard benchmarks.",

Existing defenses all come at the cost of performance, so they present signi\ufb01cant barriers to a practical deployment in high-speed networks. We propose NetWarden , a novel defense whose key design goal is to preserve TCP performance while mitigating covert channels. The use of programmable data planes makes it possible for Net-Warden to adapt defenses that were only demonstrated before as proof of concept, and apply them at linespeed. Moreover, NetWarden uses a set of performance boosting techniques to temporarily increase the performance of connections that have been affected by covert channel mitigation, with the ultimate goal of neutralizing the overall performance impact. NetWarden also uses a fastpath/slowpath architecture to combine the generality of software and the ef\ufb01ciency of hardware for effective defense. Our evaluation shows that NetWarden works smoothly with complex applications and workloads, and that it can mitigate covert timing and storage channels with little performance disturbance.",

        "title": "Justinian's GAAvernor: Robust Distributed Learning with Gradient Aggregation Agent",
        "abstract": "The hidden vulnerability of distributed learning systems against Byzantine attacks has been investigated by recent researches and, fortunately, some known defenses showed the ability to mitigate Byzantine attacks when a minority of workers are under adversarial control. Yet, our community still has very little knowledge on how to handle the situations when the proportion of malicious workers is 50% or more. Based on our preliminary study of this open challenge, we \ufb01nd there is more that can be done to restore Byzantine robustness in these more threatening situations, if we better utilize the auxiliary information inside the learning process. In this paper, we propose Justinian\u2019s GAAvernor (GAA), a Gradient Aggregation Agent which learns to be robust against Byzantine attacks via reinforcement learning techniques. Ba-sically, GAA relies on utilizing the historical interactions with the workers as experience and a quasi-validation set , a small dataset that consists of less than 10 data samples from similar data domains, to generate reward signals for policy learning. As a complement to existing defenses, our proposed approach does not bound the expected number of malicious workers and is proved to be robust in more challenging scenarios. Through extensive evaluations on four benchmark systems and against various adversarial settings, our proposed defense shows desirable robustness as if the systems were under no attacks, even in some case when 90% Byzantine workers are controlled by the adversary. Meanwhile, our approach shows a similar level of time ef\ufb01ciency compared with the state-of-the-art defenses. Moreover, GAA provides highly interpretable traces of worker behavior as by-products for further mitigation usages like Byzantine worker detection and behavior pattern analysis.",

Sys uses a two-step approach to \ufb01nd such tricky errors. First, it breaks down large\u2014tens of millions of lines\u2014systems into small pieces using user-extensible static checkers to quickly \ufb01nd and mark potential errorsites. Second, it uses user-extensible symbolic execution to deeply examine these potential errorsites for actual bugs. Both the checkers and the system itself are small (6KLOC total). Sys is \ufb02exible, because users must be able to exploit domain-or system-speci\ufb01c knowledge in order to detect errors and suppress false positives in real codebases. Sys \ufb01nds many security bugs (51 bugs, 43 con\ufb01rmed) in well-checked code\u2014the Chrome and Firefox web browsers\u2014and code that some symbolic tools struggle with\u2014the FreeBSD operating system. Sys\u2019s most interesting results include: an exploitable, cash bountied CVE in Chrome that was \ufb01xed in seven hours (and whose patch was backported in two days); a trio of bountied bugs with a CVE in Firefox; and a bountied bug in Chrome\u2019s audio support.",

        "abstract": "Attack surface reduction through the removal of unnecessary application features and code is a promising technique for improving security without incurring any additional overhead. Recent software debloating techniques consider an application\u2019s entire lifetime when extracting its code requirements, and reduce the attack surface accordingly. In this paper, we present temporal specialization , a novel approach for limiting the set of system calls available to a process depending on its phase of execution. Our approach is tailored to server applications, which exhibit distinct initialization and serving phases with different system call requirements. We present novel static analysis techniques for improving the precision of extracting the application\u2019s call graph for each execution phase, which is then used to pinpoint the system calls used in each phase. We show that requirements change throughout the lifetime of servers, and many dangerous system calls (such as execve ) can be disabled after the completion of the initialization phase. We have implemented a prototype of temporal specialization on top of the LLVM compiler, and evaluated its effectiveness with six popular server applications. Our results show that it disables 51% more security-critical system calls compared to existing library specialization approaches, while offering the additional bene\ufb01t of neutralizing 13 more Linux kernel vulnerabilities that could lead to privilege escalation.",

        "abstract": "The invention of Ethereum smart contract has enabled the blockchain users to customize computing logic in transactions. However, similar to traditional computer programs, smart contracts have vulnerabilities, which can be exploited to cause \ufb01nancial loss of contract owners. While there are many software tools for detecting vulnerabilities in the smart contract bytecode, few have focused on transactions. In this paper, we propose T X S PECTOR , a generic, logic-driven framework to investigate Ethereum transactions for attack detection. At a high level, T X S PECTOR replays history transactions and records EVM bytecode-level traces, and then encodes the control and data dependencies into logic relations. Instead of setting a pre-de\ufb01ned set of functionalities, T X S PECTOR allows users to specify customized rules to uncover various types of attacks in the transactions. We have built a prototype of T X S PECTOR and evaluated it for the detection of three Ethereum attacks that exploit: ( i ) the Re-entrancy vulnerability, ( ii ) the UncheckedCall vulnerability, and ( iii ) the Suicidal vulnerability. The results demonstrate that T X S PECTOR can effectively detect attacks in the transactions and, as a byproduct, the corresponding vulnerabilities in the smart contracts. We also show how T X S PECTOR can be used for forensic analysis on transactions, and present Detection Rules for detecting other types of attacks in addition to the three focused Ethereum attacks.",

        "abstract": "There has been a resurgent trend in the industry to enforce a variety of security policies in hardware. The current trend for developing dedicated hardware security extensions is an imperfect, lengthy, and costly process. In contrast to this trend, a \ufb02exible hardware monitor can ef\ufb01ciently enforce and enhance a variety of security policies as security threats evolve. Existing hardware monitors typically suffer from one (or more) of the following drawbacks: a restricted set of monitoring actions, considerable performance and power overheads, or an invasive design. In this paper, we propose a minimally-invasive and ef\ufb01cient implementation of a Programmable Hardware Monitor (PHMon) with expressive monitoring rules and \ufb02exible \ufb01ne-grained actions. PHMon can enforce a variety of security policies and can also assist with detecting software bugs and security vulnerabilities. Our prototype of PHMon on an FPGA includes the hardware monitor and its interface with a RISC-V Rocket processor as well as a complete Linux software stack. We demonstrate the versatility of PHMon and its ease of adoption through four different use cases: a shadow stack, a hardware-accelerated fuzzing engine, an information leak prevention mechanism, and a hardware-accelerated debugger. Our prototype implementation of PHMon incurs 0.9% performance overhead on average, while the hardware-accelerated fuzzing engine improves fuzzing performance on average by 16 \u00d7 over the state-of-the art software-based implementation. Our ASIC implementation of PHMon only incurs a 5% power overhead and a 13.5% area overhead.",

        "title": "Fuzzing Error Handling Code using Context-Sensitive Software Fault Injection",
        "abstract": "Error handling code is often critical but difficult to test in reality. As a result, many hard-to-find bugs exist in error handling code and may cause serious security problems once triggered. Fuzzing has become a widely used technique for finding software bugs nowadays. Fuzzing approaches mutate and/or generate various inputs to cover infrequently-executed code. However, existing fuzzing approaches are very limited in testing error handling code, because some of this code can be only triggered by occasional errors (such as insufficient memory and network-connection failures), but not specific inputs. Therefore, existing fuzzing approaches in general cannot effectively test such error handling code. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzing framework named FIFUZZ, to effectively test error handling code and detect bugs. The core of FIFUZZ is a context-sensitive software fault injection (SFI) approach, which can effectively cover error handling code in different calling contexts to find deep bugs hidden in error handling code with complicated contexts. We have implemented FIFUZZ and evaluated it on 9 widelyused C programs. It reports 317 alerts which are caused by 50 unique bugs in terms of the root causes. 32 of these bugs have been confirmed by related developers. We also compare FIFUZZ to existing fuzzing tools (including AFL, AFLFast, AFLSmart and FairFuzz), and find that FIFUZZ finds many bugs missed by these tools. We believe that FIFUZZ can effectively augment existing fuzzing approaches to find many real bugs that have been otherwise missed.",

        "abstract": "In the digital era, users share their personal data with service providers to obtain some utility, e.g., access to high-quality services. Yet, the induced information flows raise privacy and integrity concerns. Consequently, cautious users may want to protect their privacy by minimizing the amount of information they disclose to curious service providers. Service providers are interested in verifying the integrity of the users' data to improve their services and obtain useful knowledge for their business. In this work, we present a generic solution to the trade-off between privacy, integrity, and utility, by achieving authenticity verification of data that has been encrypted for offloading to service providers. Based on lattice-based homomorphic encryption and commitments, as well as zero-knowledge proofs, our construction enables a service provider to process and reuse third-party signed data in a privacy-friendly manner with integrity guarantees. We evaluate our solution on different use cases such as smart-metering, disease susceptibility, and location-based activity tracking, thus showing its promising applications. Our solution achieves broad generality, quantum-resistance, and relaxes some assumptions of state-of-the-art solutions without affecting performance.",

        "abstract": "Click-jacking protection on the modern Web is commonly enforced via client-side security mechanisms for framing control, like the X-Frame-Options header (XFO) and Content Security Policy (CSP). Though these client-side security mechanisms are certainly useful and successful, delegating protection to web browsers opens room for inconsistencies in the security guarantees offered to users of different browsers. In particular, inconsistencies might arise due to the lack of support for CSP and the different implementations of the underspecified XFO header. In this paper, we formally study the problem of inconsistencies in framing control policies across different browsers and we implement an automated policy analyzer based on our theory, which we use to assess the state of click-jacking protection on the Web. Our analysis shows that 10% of the (distinct) framing control policies in the wild are inconsistent and most often do not provide any level of protection to at least one browser. We thus propose recommendations for web developers and browser vendors to mitigate this issue. Finally, we design and implement a server-side proxy to retrofit security in web applications.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we consider distributed private learning. For this purpose, companies collect statistics about telemetry, usage and frequent settings from their users without disclosing individual values. We focus on rank-based statistics, speci\ufb01cally, the median which is more robust to outliers than the mean. Local differential privacy, where each user shares locally perturbed data with an untrusted server, is often used in private learning but does not provide the same accuracy as the central model, where noise is applied only once by a trusted server. Existing solutions to compute the differentially private median provide good accuracy only for large amounts of users (local model), by using a trusted third party (central model), or for a very small data universe (secure multi-party computation). We present a multi-party computation to ef\ufb01ciently compute the exponential mechanism for the median, which also supports, e.g., general rank-based statistics (e.g., p th - percentile, interquartile range) and convex optimizations for machine learning. Our approach is ef\ufb01cient (practical running time), scaleable (sublinear in the data universe size) and accurate, i.e., the absolute error is smaller than comparable methods and is independent of the number of users, hence, our protocols can be used even for a small number of users. In our experiments we were able to compute the differentially private median for 1 million users in 3 minutes using 3 semi-honest computation parties distributed over the Internet.",

        "title": "Empirical Understanding of Deletion Privacy: Experiences, Expectations, and Measures",
        "abstract": "Social platforms are heavily used by individuals to share their thoughts and personal information. However, due to regret over time about posting inappropriate social content, embarrassment, or even life or relationship changes, some past posts might also pose serious privacy concerns for them. To cope with these privacy concerns, social platforms offer deletion mechanisms that allow users to remove their contents. Quite naturally, these deletion mechanisms are really useful for removing past posts as and when needed. However, these same mechanisms also leave the users potentially vulnerable to attacks by adversaries who specifically seek the users' damaging content and exploit the act of deletion as a strong signal for identifying such content. Unfortunately, today user experiences and contextual expectations regarding such attacks on deletion privacy and deletion privacy in general are not well understood. To that end, in this paper, we conduct a user survey-based exploration involving 191 participants to unpack their prior deletion experiences, their expectations of deletion privacy, and how effective they find the current deletion mechanisms. We find that more than 80% of the users have deleted at least a social media post, and users self-reported that, on average, around 35% of their deletions happened after a week of posting. While the participants identified the irrelevancy (due to time passing) as the main reason for content removal, most of them believed that deletions indicate that the deleted content includes some damaging information to the owner. Importantly, the participants are significantly more concerned about their deletions being noticed by large-scale data collectors (e.g., the government) than individuals from their social circle. Finally, the participants felt that popular deletion mechanisms are not very effective in protecting the privacy of those deletions.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed an increasing number of protocols relying on UDP. Compared to TCP, UDP offers performance advantages such as simplicity and lower latency. This has motivated its adoption in Voice over IP, tunneling technologies, IoT, and novel Web protocols. To protect sensitive data exchange in these scenarios, the DTLS protocol has been developed as a cryptographic variation of TLS. DTLS\u2019s main challenge is to support the stateless and unreliable transport of UDP. This has forced protocol designers to make choices that affect the complexity of DTLS, and to incorporate features that need not be addressed in the numerous TLS analyses. We present the first comprehensive analysis of DTLS implementations using protocol state fuzzing. To that end, we extend TLS-Attacker, an open source framework for analyzing TLS implementations, with support for DTLS tailored to the stateless and unreliable nature of the underlying UDP layer. We build a framework for applying protocol state fuzzing on DTLS servers, and use it to learn state machine models for thirteen DTLS implementations. Analysis of the learned state models reveals four serious security vulnerabilities, including a full client authentication bypass in the latest JSSE version, as well as several functional bugs and non-conformance issues. It also uncovers considerable differences between the models, confirming the complexity of DTLS state machines.",

        "abstract": "The continuing use of proprietary cryptography in embedded systems across many industry verticals, from physical access control systems and telecommunications to machine-to-machine authentication, presents a significant obstacle to black-box security-evaluation efforts. In-depth security analysis requires locating and classifying the algorithm in often very large binary images, thus rendering manual inspection, even when aided by heuristics, time consuming. \nIn this paper, we present a novel approach to automate the identification and classification of (proprietary) cryptographic primitives within binary code. Our approach is based on Data Flow Graph (DFG) isomorphism, previously proposed by Lestringant et al. Unfortunately, their DFG isomorphism approach is limited to known primitives only, and relies on heuristics for selecting code fragments for analysis. By combining the said approach with symbolic execution, we overcome all limitations of their work, and are able to extend the analysis into the domain of unknown, proprietary cryptographic primitives. To demonstrate that our proposal is practical, we develop various signatures, each targeted at a distinct class of cryptographic primitives, and present experimental evaluations for each of them on a set of binaries, both publicly available (and thus providing reproducible results), and proprietary ones. Lastly, we provide a free and open-source implementation of our approach, called Where's Crypto?, in the form of a plug-in for the popular IDA disassembler.",

        "abstract": "Smartphone loss affects millions of users each year and causes significant monetary and data losses. Device tracking services (e.g., Google\u2019s \u201cFind My Device\u201d) enable the device owner to secure or recover a lost device, but they can be easily circumvented with physical access (e.g., turn on airplane mode). An effective loss prevention solution should immediately lock the phone and alert the owner before they leave without the phone. We present such an opensource, real-time system called Chaperone that does not require additional hardware. Chaperone adopts active acoustic sensing to detect a phone\u2019s unattended status by tracking the owner\u2019s departure via the built-in speaker and microphone. It is designed to robustly operate in real-world scenarios characterized by bursting highfrequency noise, bustling crowds, and diverse environmental layouts. We evaluate Chaperone by conducting over 1,300 experiments at a variety of locations including coffee shops, restaurants, transit stations, and cars, under different testing conditions. Chaperone provides an overall precision rate of 93% and an overall recall rate of 96% for smartphone loss events. Chaperone detects these events in under 0.5 seconds for 95% of the successful detection cases. We conduct a user study (n = 17) to investigate participants\u2019 smartphone loss experiences, collect feedback on using Chaperone, and study different alert methods. Most participants were satisfied with Chaperone\u2019s performance for its detection ability, detection accuracy, and power consumption. Finally, we provide an implementation of Chaperone as a standalone Android app.",

        "title": "CACTI: Captcha Avoidance via Client-side TEE Integration",
        "abstract": "Preventing abuse of web services by bots is an increasingly important problem, as abusive activities grow in both volume and variety. CAPTCHAs are the most common way for thwarting bot activities. However, they are often ineffective against bots and frustrating for humans. In addition, some recent CAPTCHA techniques diminish user privacy. Meanwhile, client-side Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are becoming increasingly widespread (notably, ARM TrustZone and Intel SGX), allowing establishment of trust in a small part (trust anchor or TCB) of client-side hardware. This prompts the question: can a TEE help reduce (or remove entirely) user burden of solving CAPTCHAs? \nIn this paper, we design CACTI: CAPTCHA Avoidance via Client-side TEE Integration. Using client-side TEEs, CACTI allows legitimate clients to generate unforgeable rate-proofs demonstrating how frequently they have performed specific actions. These rate-proofs can be sent to web servers in lieu of solving CAPTCHAs. CACTI provides strong client privacy guarantees, since the information is only sent to the visited website and authenticated using a group signature scheme. Our evaluations show that overall latency of generating and verifying a CACTI rate-proof is less than 0.25 sec, while CACTI's bandwidth overhead is over 98% lower than that of current CAPTCHA systems.",

        "abstract": "Visual fingerprints are used in human verification of identities to improve security against impersonation attacks. The verification requires the user to confirm that the visual fingerprint image derived from the trusted source is the same as the one derived from the unknown source. We introduce CEAL, a novel mechanism to build generators for visual fingerprint representations of arbitrary public strings. CEAL stands out from existing approaches in three significant aspects: (1) eliminates the need for hand curated image generation rules by learning a generator model that imitates the style and domain of fingerprint images from a large collection of sample images, hence enabling easy customizability, (2) operates within limits of the visual discriminative ability of human perception, such that the learned fingerprint image generator avoids mapping distinct keys to images which are not distinguishable by humans, and (3) the resulting model deterministically generates realistic fingerprint images from an input vector, where the vector components are designated to control visual properties which are either readily perceptible to a human eye, or imperceptible, yet necessary for accurately modeling the target image domain. Unlike existing visual fingerprint generators, CEAL factors in the limits of human perception, and pushes the key payload capacity of the images toward the limits of its generative model: We have built a generative network for nature landscape images which can reliably encode 123 bits of entropy in the fingerprint. We label 3,996 image pairs by 931 participants. In experiments with 402 million attack image pairs, we found that pre-image attacks performed by adversaries equipped with the human perception discriminators that we build, achieve a success rate against CEAL that is at most 2 \u00d710\u22124%. The CEAL generator model is small (67MB) and efficient (2.3s to generate an image fingerprint on a laptop).",

        "abstract": "The IEEE 802.11 WPA2 protocol is widely used across the globe to protect network connections. The protocol, which is specified on more than three-thousand pages and has received various patches over the years, is extremely complex and therefore hard to analyze. In particular, it involves various mechanisms that interact with each other in subtle ways, which offers little hope for modular reasoning. Perhaps because of this, there exists no formal or cryptographic argument that shows that the patches to the core protocol indeed prevent the corresponding attacks, such as, e.g., the notorious KRACK attacks from 2017. In this work, we address this situation and present an extensive formal analysis of the WPA2 protocol design. Our model is the first that is detailed enough to detect the KRACK attacks; it includes mechanisms such as the four-way handshake, the group-key handshake, WNM sleep mode, the dataconfidentiality protocol, and their complex interactions. Our analysis provides the first security argument, in any formalism, that the patched WPA2 protocol meets its claimed security guarantees in the face of complex modern attacks.",

        "abstract": "The Universal Serial Bus (USB) connects external devices to a host. This interface exposes the OS kernels and device drivers to attacks by malicious devices. Unfortunately, kernels and drivers were developed under a security model that implicitly trusts connected devices. Drivers expect faulty hardware but not malicious attacks. Similarly, security testing drivers is challenging as input must cross the hardware/software barrier. Fuzzing, the most widely used bug finding technique, relies on providing random data to programs. However, fuzzing device drivers is challenging due to the difficulty in crossing the hardware/software barrier and providing random device data to the driver under test. We present USBFuzz, a portable, flexible, and modular framework for fuzz testing USB drivers. At its core, USBFuzz uses a software-emulated USB device to provide random device data to drivers (when they perform IO operations). As the emulated USB device works at the device level, porting it to other platforms is straight-forward. Using the USBFuzz framework, we apply (i) coverage-guided fuzzing to a broad range of USB drivers in the Linux kernel; (ii) dumb fuzzing in FreeBSD, MacOS, and Windows through cross-pollination seeded by the Linux inputs; and (iii) focused fuzzing of a USB webcam driver. USBFuzz discovered a total of 26 new bugs, including 16 memory bugs of high security impact in various Linux subsystems (USB core, USB sound, and network), one bug in FreeBSD, three in MacOS (two resulting in an unplanned reboot and one freezing the system), and four in Windows 8 and Windows 10 (resulting in Blue Screens of Death), and one bug in the Linux USB host controller driver and another one in a USB camera driver. From the Linux bugs, we have fixed and upstreamed 11 bugs and received 10 CVEs.",

        "abstract": "Although targeted advertising has drawn signifcant attention from privacy researchers, many critical empirical questions remain. In particular, only a few of the dozens of targeting mechanisms used by major advertising platforms are well understood, and studies examining users\u2019 perceptions of ad targeting often rely on hypothetical situations. Further, it is unclear how well existing transparency mechanisms, from data-access rights to ad explanations, actually serve the users they are intended for. To develop a deeper understanding of the current targeting advertising ecosystem, this paper engages 231 participants\u2019 own Twitter data, containing ads they were shown and the associated targeting criteria, for measurement and user study. We fnd many targeting mechanisms ignored by prior work \u2014 including advertiser-uploaded lists of specifc users, lookalike audiences, and retargeting cam-paigns \u2014 are widely used on Twitter. Crucially, participants found these understudied practices among the most privacy invasive. Participants also found ad explanations designed for this study more useful, more comprehensible, and overall more preferable than Twitter\u2019s current ad explanations. Our fndings underscore the benefts of data access, characterize unstudied facets of targeted advertising, and identify potential directions for improving transparency in targeted advertising.",

        "abstract": "Increasingly mobile device users are being hurt by security or privacy issues with the apps they use. App developers can help prevent this; inexpensive security assurance techniques to do so are now well established, but do developers use them? And if they do so, is that reflected in more secure apps? From a survey of 335 successful app developers, we conclude that less than a quarter of such professionals have access to security experts; that less than a third use assurance techniques regularly; and that few have made more than cosmetic changes as a result of the European GDPR legislation. Reas-suringly, we found that app developers tend to use more assurance techniques and make more frequent security updates when (1) they see more need for security, and (2) there is security expert or champion involvement. In a second phase we downloaded the apps corresponding to each completed survey and analyzed them for SSL issues, cryptographic API misuse and privacy leaks, finding only one fifth defect-free as far as our tools could detect. We found that having security experts or champions involved led to more cryptographic API issues, probably because of greater cryptography usage; but that measured defect counts did not relate to the need for security, nor to the use of assurance techniques. This offers two major opportunities for research: to further improve the detection of security issues in app binaries; and to support increasing the use of assurance techniques in the app developer community.",

        "abstract": "Proofs of Retrievability (PoRs) are protocols which allow a client to store data remotely and to efficiently ensure, via audits, that the entirety of that data is still intact. A dynamic PoR system also supports efficient retrieval and update of any small portion of the data. We propose new, simple protocols for dynamic PoR that are designed for practical efficiency, trading decreased persistent storage for increased server computation, and show in fact that this tradeoff is inherent via a lower bound proof of time-space for any PoR scheme. Notably, ours is the first dynamic PoR which does not require any special encoding of the data stored on the server, meaning it can be trivially composed with any database service or with existing techniques for encryption or redundancy. Our implementation and deployment on Google Cloud Platform demonstrates our solution is scalable: for example, auditing a 1TB file takes 16 minutes at a monetary cost of just $0.23 USD. We also present several further enhancements, reducing the amount of client storage, or the communication bandwidth, or allowing public verifiability, wherein any untrusted third party may conduct an audit.",

        "title": "DELF: Safeguarding deletion correctness in Online Social Networks",
        "abstract": "Deletion is a core facet of Online Social Networks (OSNs). For users, deletion is a tool to remove what they have shared and control their data. For OSNs, robust deletion is both an obligation to their users and a risk when developer mistakes inevitably occur. While developers are effective at identifying high-level deletion requirements in products (e.g., users should be able to delete posted photos), they are less effective at mapping high-level requirements into concrete operations (e.g., deleting all relevant items in data stores). Without framework support, developer mistakes lead to violations of users\u2019 privacy, such as retaining data that should be deleted, deleting the wrong data, and exploitable vulnerabilities. We propose DELF, a deletion framework for modern OSNs. In DELF, developers specify deletion annotations on data type definitions, which the framework maps into asynchronous, reliable and temporarily reversible operations on backing data stores. DELF validates annotations both statically and dynamically, proactively flagging errors and suggesting fixes. We deployed DELF in three distinct OSNs, showing the feasibility of our approach. DELF detected, surfaced, and helped developers correct thousands of omissions and dozens of mistakes, while also enabling timely recovery in tens of incidents where user data was inadvertently deleted.",

Since flash memory cell holds information in the analog threshold voltage, flash cell may hold the imprints of previously written data even after digital sanitization. In this paper, we show that data is partially or completely recoverable from the flash media sanitized with \u201cscrubbing\u201d based technique, which is a popular technique for page deletion in NAND flash. We find that adversary may utilize the data retention property of the memory cells for recovering the deleted data using standard digital interfaces with the memory. We demonstrate data recovery from commercial flash memory chip, sanitized with scrubbing, by using partial erase operation on the chip. Our results show that analog scrubbing is needed to securely delete information in flash system. We propose and implement analog scrubbing using partial program operation based on the file creation time information.",

        "title": "MVP: Detecting Vulnerabilities using Patch-Enhanced Vulnerability Signatures",
        "abstract": "Recurring vulnerabilities widely exist and remain undetected in real-world systems, which are often resulted from reused code base or shared code logic. However, the potentially small differences between vulnerable functions and their patched functions as well as the possibly large differences between vulnerable functions and target functions to be detected bring challenges to clone-based and function matching-based approaches to identify these recurring vulnerabilities, i.e., causing high false positives and false negatives. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect recurring vulnerabilities with low false positives and low false negatives. We first use our novel program slicing to extract vulnerability and patch signatures from vulnerable function and its patched function at syntactic and semantic levels. Then a target function is identified as potentially vulnerable if it matches the vulnerability signature but does not match the patch signature. We implement our approach in a tool named MVP. Our evaluation on ten open-source systems has shown that, i) MVP significantly outperformed state-of-the-art clone-based and function matching-based recurring vulnerability detection approaches; ii) MVP detected recurring vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by general-purpose vulnerability detection approaches, i.e., two learning-based approaches and two commercial tools; and iii) MVP has detected 97 new vulnerabilities with 23 CVE identifiers assigned.",

        "title": "PatchGuard: A Provably Robust Defense against Adversarial Patches via Small Receptive Fields and Masking",
        "abstract": "Localized adversarial patches aim to induce misclassification in machine learning models by arbitrarily modifying pixels within a restricted region of an image. Such attacks can be realized in the physical world by attaching the adversarial patch to the object to be misclassified, and defending against such attacks is an unsolved/open problem. In this paper, we propose a general defense framework called PatchGuard that can achieve high provable robustness while maintaining high clean accuracy against localized adversarial patches. The cornerstone of PatchGuard involves the use of CNNs with small receptive fields to impose a bound on the number of features corrupted by an adversarial patch. Given a bounded number of corrupted features, the problem of designing an adversarial patch defense reduces to that of designing a secure feature aggregation mechanism. Towards this end, we present our robust masking defense that robustly detects and masks corrupted features to recover the correct prediction. Notably, we can prove the robustness of our defense against any adversary within our threat model. Our extensive evaluation on ImageNet, ImageNette (a 10-class subset of ImageNet), and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrates that our defense achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both provable robust accuracy and clean accuracy.",

        "abstract": "We present PANCAKE , the \ufb01rst system to protect key-value stores from access pattern leakage attacks with small constant factor bandwidth overhead. PANCAKE uses a new approach, that we call frequency smoothing , to transform plaintext accesses into uniformly distributed encrypted accesses to an encrypted data store. We show that frequency smoothing prevents access pattern leakage attacks by passive persistent adversaries in a new formal security model. We integrate PANCAKE into three key-value stores used in production clusters, and demonstrate its practicality: on standard benchmarks, PANCAKE achieves 229 \u00d7 better throughput than non-recursive Path ORAM \u2014 within 3\u20136 \u00d7 of insecure base-lines for these key-value stores.",

We use it to demonstrate new classes of backdoors strictly more powerful than those in prior literature: single-pixel and physical backdoors in ImageNet models, backdoors that switch the model to a covert, privacy-violating task, and backdoors that do not require inference-time input modifications. \nOur attack is \\emph{blind}: the attacker cannot modify the training data, nor observe the execution of his code, nor access the resulting model. Blind backdoor training uses multi-objective optimization to achieve high accuracy on both the main and backdoor tasks. Finally, we show how the blind attack can evade all known defenses, and propose new ones.",

        "title": "UNIFUZZ: A Holistic and Pragmatic Metrics-Driven Platform for Evaluating Fuzzers",
        "abstract": "A flurry of fuzzing tools (fuzzers) have been proposed in the literature, aiming at detecting software vulnerabilities effectively and efficiently. To date, it is however still challenging to compare fuzzers due to the inconsistency of the benchmarks, performance metrics, and/or environments for evaluation, which buries the useful insights and thus impedes the discovery of promising fuzzing primitives. In this paper, we design and develop UNIFUZZ, an open-source and metrics-driven platform for assessing fuzzers in a comprehensive and quantitative manner. Specifically, UNIFUZZ to date has incorporated 35 usable fuzzers, a benchmark of 20 real-world programs, and six categories of performance metrics. We first systematically study the usability of existing fuzzers, find and fix a number of flaws, and integrate them into UNIFUZZ. Based on the study, we propose a collection of pragmatic performance metrics to evaluate fuzzers from six complementary perspectives. Using UNIFUZZ, we conduct in-depth evaluations of several prominent fuzzers including AFL [1], AFLFast [2], Angora [3], Honggfuzz [4], MOPT [5], QSYM [6], T-Fuzz [7] and VUzzer64 [8]. We find that none of them outperforms the others across all the target programs, and that using a single metric to assess the performance of a fuzzer may lead to unilateral conclusions, which demonstrates the significance of comprehensive metrics. Moreover, we identify and investigate previously overlooked factors that may significantly affect a fuzzer's performance, including instrumentation methods and crash analysis tools. Our empirical results show that they are critical to the evaluation of a fuzzer. We hope that our findings can shed light on reliable fuzzing evaluation, so that we can discover promising fuzzing primitives to effectively facilitate fuzzer designs in the future.",

        "abstract": "The DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) standard allows clients and servers to establish a TLS connection without relying on trusted third parties like CAs by publishing TLSA records. DANE uses the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) PKI to achieve integrity and authenticity. However, DANE can only work correctly if each principal in its PKI properly performs its duty: through their DNSSEC-aware DNS servers, DANE servers (e.g., SMTP servers) must publish their TLSA records, which are consistent with their certi\ufb01cates. Similarly, DANE clients (e.g., SMTP clients) must verify the DANE servers\u2019 TLSA records, which are also used to validate the fetched certi\ufb01cates. DANE is rapidly gaining popularity in the email ecosystem, to help improve transport security between mail servers. Yet its security bene\ufb01ts hinge on deploying DANE correctly. In this paper we perform a large-scale, longitudinal, and comprehensive measurement study on how well the DANE standard and its relevant protocols are deployed and managed. We collect data for all second-level domains under the .com , .net , .org , .nl , and .se TLDs over a period of 24 months to analyze server-side deployment and management. To analyse the client-side deployment and management, we investigate 29 popular email service providers, and four popular MTA and eleven DNS software programs. Our study reveals pervasive mismanagement in the DANE ecosystem. For instance, we found that 35% of TLSA records cannot be validated due to missing or incorrect DNSSEC records, and 3.68% of them are inconsistent with their certi\ufb01cates. We also found that only four email service providers support DANE for both outgoing and",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, virtually all mobile apps rely on communicating with a network backend. Given the sensitive nature of the data exchanged between apps and their backends, securing these network communications is of growing importance. In recent years, Google has developed a number of security mechanisms for Android apps, ranging from multiple KeyStores to the recent introduction of the new Network Security Policy, an XML-based con\ufb01guration \ufb01le that allows apps to de\ufb01ne their network security posture.

We also found that several popular ad libraries require apps to weaken their security policy, the key problem lying in the vast complexity of the ad ecosystem.

        "title": "PTAuth: Temporal Memory Safety via Robust Points-to Authentication",
        "abstract": "Temporal memory corruptions are commonly exploited software vulnerabilities that can lead to powerful attacks. Despite significant progress made by decades of research on mitigation techniques, existing countermeasures fall short due to either limited coverage or overly high overhead. Furthermore, they require external mechanisms (e.g., spatial memory safety) to protect their metadata. Otherwise, their protection can be bypassed or disabled. To address these limitations, we present robust points-to authentication, a novel runtime scheme for detecting all kinds of temporal memory corruptions. We built a prototype system, called PTAuth, that realizes this scheme on ARM architectures. PTAuth contains a customized compiler for code analysis and instrumentation and a runtime library for performing the points-to authentication as a protected program runs. PTAuth leverages the Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) feature, provided by the ARMv8.3 and later CPUs, which serves as a simple hardware-based encryption primitive. PTAuth uses minimal in-memory metadata and protects its metadata without requiring spatial memory safety. We report our evaluation of PTAuth in terms of security, robustness and performance using 150 vulnerable programs from Juliet test suite and the SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks. PTAuth detects all three categories of heap-based temporal memory corruptions, generates zero false alerts, and slows down program execution by 26% (this number was measured based on software-emulated PAC; it is expected to decrease to 20% when using hardware-based PAC). We also show that PTAuth incurs 2% memory overhead thanks to the efficient use of metadata.",

        "abstract": "Security of machine learning is increasingly becoming a major concern due to the ubiquitous deployment of deep learning in many security-sensitive domains. Many prior studies have shown external attacks such as adversarial examples that tamper with the integrity of DNNs using maliciously crafted inputs. However, the security implication of internal threats (i.e., hardware vulnerability) to DNN models has not yet been well understood. In this paper, we demonstrate the first hardware-based attack on quantized deep neural networks-DeepHammer-that deterministically induces bit flips in model weights to compromise DNN inference by exploiting the rowhammer vulnerability. DeepHammer performs aggressive bit search in the DNN model to identify the most vulnerable weight bits that are flippable under system constraints. To trigger deterministic bit flips across multiple pages within reasonable amount of time, we develop novel system-level techniques that enable fast deployment of victim pages, memory-efficient rowhammering and precise flipping of targeted bits. DeepHammer can deliberately degrade the inference accuracy of the victim DNN system to a level that is only as good as random guess, thus completely depleting the intelligence of targeted DNN systems. We systematically demonstrate our attacks on real systems against 12 DNN architectures with 4 different datasets and different application domains. Our evaluation shows that DeepHammer is able to successfully tamper DNN inference behavior at run-time within a few minutes. We further discuss several mitigation techniques from both algorithm and system levels to protect DNNs against such attacks. Our work highlights the need to incorporate security mechanisms in future deep learning system to enhance the robustness of DNN against hardware-based deterministic fault injections.",

        "title": "KOOBE: Towards Facilitating Exploit Generation of Kernel Out-Of-Bounds Write Vulnerabilities",
        "abstract": "The monolithic nature of modern OS kernels leads to a constant stream of bugs being discovered. It is often unclear which of these bugs are worth \ufb01xing, as only a subset of them may be serious enough to lead to security takeovers ( i.e., privilege escalations). Therefore, researchers have recently started to develop automated exploit generation techniques (for UAF bugs) to assist the bug triage process. In this paper, we investigate another top memory vulnerability in Linux kernel \u2014 out-of-bounds (OOB) memory write from heap. We design KOOBE to assist the analysis of such vulnerabilities based on two observations: (1) Surprisingly often, different OOB vulnerability instances exhibit a wide range of capabilities. (2) Kernel exploits are multi-interaction in nature ( i.e., multiple syscalls are involved in an exploit) which allows the exploit crafting process to be modular. Speci\ufb01cally, we focus on the extraction of capabilities of an OOB vulnerability which will feed the subsequent exploitability evaluation process. Our system builds on several building blocks, including a novel capability-guided fuzzing solution to uncover hidden capabilities, and a way to compose capabilities together to further enhance the likelihood of successful exploitations. In our evaluation, we demonstrate the applicability of KOOBE by exhaustively analyzing 17 most recent Linux kernel OOB vulnerabilities (where only 5 of them have publicly available exploits), for which KOOBE successfully generated candidate exploit strategies for 11 of them (including 5 that do not even have any CVEs assigned). Subsequently from these strategies, we are able to construct fully working exploits for all of them.",

        "abstract": "Today's proliferation of powerful facial recognition systems poses a real threat to personal privacy. As this http URL demonstrated, anyone can canvas the Internet for data and train highly accurate facial recognition models of individuals without their knowledge. We need tools to protect ourselves from potential misuses of unauthorized facial recognition systems. Unfortunately, no practical or effective solutions exist. \nIn this paper, we propose Fawkes, a system that helps individuals inoculate their images against unauthorized facial recognition models. Fawkes achieves this by helping users add imperceptible pixel-level changes (we call them \"cloaks\") to their own photos before releasing them. When used to train facial recognition models, these \"cloaked\" images produce functional models that consistently cause normal images of the user to be misidentified. We experimentally demonstrate that Fawkes provides 95+% protection against user recognition regardless of how trackers train their models. Even when clean, uncloaked images are \"leaked\" to the tracker and used for training, Fawkes can still maintain an 80+% protection success rate. We achieve 100% success in experiments against today's state-of-the-art facial recognition services. Finally, we show that Fawkes is robust against a variety of countermeasures that try to detect or disrupt image cloaks.",

        "abstract": "Firefox and other major browsers rely on dozens of third-party libraries to render audio, video, images, and other content. These libraries are a frequent source of vulnerabilities. To mitigate this threat, we are migrating Firefox to an architecture that isolates these libraries in lightweight sandboxes, dramatically reducing the impact of a compromise. \nRetrofitting isolation can be labor-intensive, very prone to security bugs, and requires critical attention to performance. To help, we developed RLBox, a framework that minimizes the burden of converting Firefox to securely and efficiently use untrusted code. To enable this, RLBox employs static information flow enforcement, and lightweight dynamic checks, expressed directly in the C++ type system. \nRLBox supports efficient sandboxing through either software-based-fault isolation or multi-core process isolation. Performance overheads are modest and transient, and have only minor impact on page latency. We demonstrate this by sandboxing performance-sensitive image decoding libraries ( libjpeg and libpng ), video decoding libraries ( libtheora and libvpx ), the libvorbis audio decoding library, and the zlib decompression library. \nRLBox, using a WebAssembly sandbox, has been integrated into production Firefox to sandbox the libGraphite font shaping library.",

Yet, state-of-the-art systems do not offer strong security or struggle with frequent domain crossings and oftentimes intrusive kernel modi\ufb01cations. We propose Donky, an ef\ufb01cient hardware-software co-design for strong in-process isolation based on dynamic memory protection domains. The two components of our design are a secure software framework and a non-intrusive hardware extension. We facilitate domain switches entirely in userspace, thus minimizing switching overhead as well as kernel complexity. We show the versatility of Donky in three realistic use cases, secure V8 sandboxing, software vaults, and untrusted third-party libraries. We provide an open-source implementation on a RISC-V Ariane CPU and an Intel-MPK-based emulation mode for x86. We evaluate the security and performance of our implementation for RISC-V synthesized on an FPGA. We also evaluate the performance on x86 and show why our new design is more secure than Intel MPK. Donky does not impede the runtime of in-domain computation. Cross-domain switches are 16\u2013116x faster than regular process context switches. Fully protecting the mbedTLS cryptographic operations has a 4 % overhead.",

        "abstract": "Today\u2019s cloud tenants are facing severe security threats such as compromised hypervisors, which forces a strong adversary model where the hypervisor should be excluded out of the TCB. Previous approaches to shielding guest VMs either suffer from insufficient protection or result in suboptimal performance due to frequent VM exits (especially for I/O operations). This paper presents CloudVisor-D, an efficient nested hypervisor design that embraces both strong protection and high performance. The core idea of CloudVisor-D is to disaggregate the nested hypervisor by separating major protection logics into a protected Guardian-VM alongside each guest VM. The Guardian-VM is securely isolated and protected by the nested hypervisor and provides secure services for most privileged operations like hypercalls, EPT violations and I/O operations from guest VMs. By leveraging recent hardware features, most privileged operations from a guest VM require no VM exits to the nested hypervisor, which are the major sources of performance slowdown in prior designs. We have implemented CloudVisor-D on a commercially available machine with these recent hardware features. Experimental evaluation shows that CloudVisor-D incurs negligible performance overhead even for I/O intensive benchmarks and in some cases outperforms a vanilla hypervisor due to the reduced number of VM exits.",

        "abstract": "We present Virtual Secure Platform (VSP), the first comprehensive platform that implements a multi-opcode general-purpose sequential processor over Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). VSP protects both the data and functions on which the data are evaluated from the adversary in a secure computation offloading situation like cloud computing. We proposed a complete processor architecture with a five-stage pipeline, which improves the performance of the VSP by providing more parallelism in circuit evaluation. In addition, we also designed a custom Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) to reduce the gate count of our processor, along with an entire set of toolchains to ensure that arbitrary C programs can be compiled into our custom ISA. In order to speed up instruction evaluation over VSP, CMUX Memory based ROM and RAM constructions over FHE are also proposed. Our experiments show that both the pipelined architecture and the CMUX Memory technique are effective in improving the performance of the proposed processor. We provide an open-source implementation of VSP which achieves a per-instruction latency of less than 1 second. We demonstrate that compared to the best existing processor over FHE, our implementation runs nearly 1,600$\\times$ faster.",

        "abstract": "As a fundamental communicative service, email is playing an important role in both individual and corporate communications, which also makes it one of the most frequently attack vectors. An email's authenticity is based on an authentication chain involving multiple protocols, roles and services, the inconsistency among which creates security threats. Thus, it depends on the weakest link of the chain, as any failed part can break the whole chain-based defense. This paper systematically analyzes the transmission of an email and identifies a series of new attacks capable of bypassing SPF, DKIM, DMARC and user-interface protections. In particular, by conducting a \"cocktail\" joint attack, more realistic emails can be forged to penetrate the celebrated email services, such as Gmail and Outlook. We conduct a large-scale experiment on 30 popular email services and 23 email clients, and find that all of them are vulnerable to certain types of new attacks. We have duly reported the identified vulnerabilities to the related email service providers, and received positive responses from 11 of them, including Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud and Alibaba. Furthermore, we propose key mitigating measures to defend against the new attacks. Therefore, this work is of great value for identifying email spoofing attacks and improving the email ecosystem's overall security.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning involves expensive data collection and training procedures. Model owners may be concerned that valuable intellectual property can be leaked if adversaries mount model extraction attacks. Because it is difficult to defend against model extraction without sacrificing significant prediction accuracy, watermarking leverages unused model capacity to have the model overfit to outlier input-output pairs, which are not sampled from the task distribution and are only known to the defender. The defender then demonstrates knowledge of the input-output pairs to claim ownership of the model at inference. The effectiveness of watermarks remains limited because they are distinct from the task distribution and can thus be easily removed through compression or other forms of knowledge transfer. \nWe introduce Entangled Watermarking Embeddings (EWE). Our approach encourages the model to learn common features for classifying data that is sampled from the task distribution, but also data that encodes watermarks. An adversary attempting to remove watermarks that are entangled with legitimate data is also forced to sacrifice performance on legitimate data. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Google Speech Commands validate that the defender can claim model ownership with 95% confidence after less than 10 queries to the stolen copy, at a modest cost of 1% accuracy in the defended model's performance.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning systems are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. In particular, query-based black-box attacks do not require knowledge of the deep learning model, but can compute adversarial examples over the network by submitting queries and inspecting returns. Recent work largely improves the efficiency of those attacks, demonstrating their practicality on today's ML-as-a-service platforms. We propose Blacklight, a new defense against query-based black-box adversarial attacks. The fundamental insight driving our design is that, to compute adversarial examples, these attacks perform iterative optimization over the network, producing image queries highly similar in the input space. Blacklight detects query-based black-box attacks by detecting highly similar queries, using an efficient similarity engine operating on probabilistic content fingerprints. We evaluate Blacklight against eight state-of-the-art attacks, across a variety of models and image classification tasks. Blacklight identifies them all, often after only a handful of queries. By rejecting all detected queries, Blacklight prevents any attack to complete, even when attackers persist to submit queries after account ban or query rejection. Blacklight is also robust against several powerful countermeasures, including an optimal black-box attack that approximates white-box attacks in efficiency. Finally, we illustrate how Blacklight generalizes to other domains like text classification.",

        "abstract": "Disinformation is proliferating on the internet, and platforms are responding by attaching warnings to content. There is little evidence, however, that these warnings help users identify or avoid disinformation. In this work, we adapt methods and results from the information security warning literature in order to design and evaluate effective disinformation warnings. \nIn an initial laboratory study, we used a simulated search task to examine contextual and interstitial disinformation warning designs. We found that users routinely ignore contextual warnings, but users notice interstitial warnings--and respond by seeking information from alternative sources. \nWe then conducted a follow-on crowdworker study with eight interstitial warning designs. We confirmed a significant impact on user information-seeking behavior, and we found that a warning's design could effectively inform users or convey a risk of harm. We also found, however, that neither user comprehension nor fear of harm moderated behavioral effects. \nOur work provides evidence that disinformation warnings can -- when designed well -- help users identify and avoid disinformation. We show a path forward for designing effective warnings, and we contribute repeatable methods for evaluating behavioral effects. We also surface a possible dilemma: disinformation warnings might be able to inform users and guide behavior, but the behavioral effects might result from user experience friction, not informed decision making.",

While trusted execution environments (TEEs) are promising options for preventing the direct leakage of private video content, they remain vulnerable to side-channel attacks. \nWe present Visor, a system that provides confidentiality for the user's video stream as well as the ML models in the presence of a compromised cloud platform and untrusted co-tenants. Visor executes video pipelines in a hybrid TEE that spans both the CPU and GPU. It protects the pipeline against side-channel attacks induced by data-dependent access patterns of video modules, and also addresses leakage in the CPU-GPU communication channel. Visor is up to $1000\\times$ faster than naive oblivious solutions, and its overheads relative to a non-oblivious baseline are limited to $2\\times$--$6\\times$.",

        "abstract": "Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) use hardware-basedisolation toguardsensitivedatafrom conventionalmono-lithic OSes. While such isolation strengthens security guarantees, it also introduces a semantic gap between the TEE on the one side and the conventional OS and applications on the other. In this work, we studied the impact of this semantic gap on the handling of sensitive data by Trusted Applications (TAs) running in popular TEEs. We found that the combination of two properties, ( i ) multi-tenancy and ( ii ) statefulness in TAs leads to vulnerabilities of Horizontal Privilege Escalation (HPE). These vulnerabilities leaked sensitive session data or provided cryptographic oracles without requiring code execution vulnerabilities in TEE logic. We identi\ufb01ed 19 HPE vulnerabilities present across 95 TAs running on three major ARM TrustZone-basedtrustedOSes. Ourresults showedthatHPE attacks can be used to decrypt DRM protected content, to forge attestations, andtoobtaincryptographickeysunderallthreeevaluatedOSes. Here, we present HOOPER an automatic symbolic execution based scanner for HPE vulnerabilities, in order to aid manual analysis and to dramatically reduce overall time. In particular, in the Teegris Trusted OS HOOPER is able to identify 19 out of 24 HPE-based attack \ufb02ows in 24-hours contrasted with our original manual analysis time of approximately four weeks.",

        "title": "Exploring the Security Boundary of Data Reconstruction via Neuron Exclusivity Analysis",
        "abstract": "Among existing privacy attacks on the gradient of neural networks, \\emph{data reconstruction attack}, which reverse engineers the training batch from the gradient, poses a severe threat on the private training data. Despite its empirical success on large architectures and small training batches, unstable reconstruction accuracy is also observed when a smaller architecture or a larger batch is under attack. Due to the weak interpretability of existing learning-based attacks, there is little known on why, when and how data reconstruction attack is feasible. In our work, we perform the first analytic study on the security boundary of data reconstruction from gradient via a microcosmic view on neural networks with rectified linear units (ReLUs), the most popular activation function in practice. For the first time, we characterize the insecure/secure boundary of data reconstruction attack in terms of the \\emph{neuron exclusivity state} of a training batch, indexed by the number of \\emph{\\textbf{Ex}clusively \\textbf{A}ctivated \\textbf{N}eurons} (ExANs, i.e., a ReLU activated by only one sample in a batch). Intuitively, we show a training batch with more ExANs are more vulnerable to data reconstruction attack and vice versa. On the one hand, we construct a novel deterministic attack algorithm which substantially outperforms previous attacks for reconstructing training batches lying in the insecure boundary of a neural network. Meanwhile, for training batches lying in the secure boundary, we prove the impossibility of unique reconstruction, based on which an exclusivity reduction strategy is devised to enlarge the secure boundary for mitigation purposes.",

        "title": "MIRAGE: Mitigating Conflict-Based Cache Attacks with a Practical Fully-Associative Design",
        "abstract": "Shared caches in modern processors are vulnerable to conflict-based attacks, whereby an attacker monitors the access pattern of a victim by engineering cache-set conflicts. Recent mitigations propose a randomized mapping of addresses to cache locations to obfuscate addresses that can conflict with a target address. Unfortunately, such designs continue to select eviction candidates from a small subset of the resident cache lines, which makes such designs vulnerable to algorithms that can quickly identify the conflicting addresses. \nThis paper presents Mirage, a practical design for a fully associative cache, wherein eviction candidates are selected randomly from among all the lines resident in the cache, to be immune to set-conflicts. A key challenge in naively adopting such designs for large shared caches (containing tens of thousands of lines) is the complexity of cache-lookup, as that can require searching through all the lines resident in the cache in such designs. Mirage practically enables a fully-associative design, while maintaining the access latency similar to a traditional set-associative cache using: (1) Pointer-based indirection from the tag-store to the data-store, which allows a newly installed address to evict data of any resident line, (2) Skewed-associative tag-store with extra invalid tags, wherein incoming addresses can be installed without set-conflicts, and (3) Load-aware placement that maximizes the availability of sets with invalid tags, to eliminate set-conflicts. Our analysis shows Mirage provides the global-eviction property of a fully-associative cache throughout the system lifetime (violations of full-associativity, i.e set-conflicts, occur less than once in 10^4 to 10^17 years), offering a principled defense against set-conflict based attacks. Mirage incurs negligible slowdown (0.3%) and 12-15% extra storage compared to the recently proposed Scatter-Cache.",

        "abstract": "Link shimming (also known as URL wrapping) is a technique widely used by websites, where URLs on a site are rewritten to direct link navigations to an intermediary end-point before redirecting to the original destination. This \u201cshim-ming\u201d of URL clicks can serve navigation security, privacy, and analytics purposes, and has been deployed by prominent websites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Google) for over a decade. Yet, we lack a deep understanding of its purported security and privacy contributions, particularly in today\u2019s web ecosystem, where modern browsers provide potential alternative mechanisms for protecting link navigations without link shimming\u2019s costs. In this paper, we provide a large-scale empirical evaluation of link shimming\u2019s security and privacy contributions, using Facebook\u2019s real-world deployment as a case study. Our results indicate that even in the modern web, link shimming can provide meaningful security and privacy bene\ufb01ts to users broadly. These bene\ufb01ts are most notable for the sizable populations that we observed with a high prevalence of legacy browser clients, such as in mobile-centric developing countries. We discuss the tradeoff of these gains against potential costs. Beyond link shimming, our \ufb01ndings also provide insights for advancing user online protection, such as on the web ecosystem\u2019s distribution of responsibility, legacy software scenarios, and user responses to website security warnings.",

        "title": "Shattered Chain of Trust: Understanding Security Risks in Cross-Cloud IoT Access Delegation",
        "abstract": "IoT clouds facilitate the communication between IoT devices and users, and authorize users\u2019 access to their devices. In this paradigm, an IoT device is usually managed under a particular IoT cloud designated by the device vendor, e.g., Philips bulbs are managed under Philips Hue cloud. Today\u2019s mainstream IoT clouds also support device access delegation across different vendors (e.g., Philips Hue, LIFX, etc.) and cloud providers (e.g., Google, IFTTT, etc.): for example, Philips Hue and SmartThings clouds support to delegate device access to another cloud such as Google Home, so a user can manage multiple devices from different vendors all through Google Home. Serving this purpose are the IoT delegation mechanisms developed and utilized by IoT clouds, which we found are heterogeneous and ad-hoc in the wild, in the absence of a standardized delegation protocol suited for IoT environments. In this paper, we report the first systematic study on real-world IoT access delegation, based upon a semi-automatic verification tool we developed. Our study brought to light the pervasiveness of security risks in these delegation mechanisms, allowing the adversary (e.g., Airbnb tenants, former employees) to gain unauthorized access to the victim\u2019s devices (e.g., smart locks) or impersonate the devices to trigger other devices. We confirmed the presence of critical security flaws in these mechanisms through end-to-end exploits on them, and further conducted a measurement study. Our research demonstrates the serious consequences of these exploits and the security implications of the practice today for building these mechanisms. We reported our findings to related parties, which acknowledged the problems. We further propose principles for developing more secure cross-cloud IoT delegation services, before a standardized solution can be widely deployed.",

        "abstract": "Text-based toxic content detection is an important tool for reducing harmful interactions in online social media environments. Yet, its underlying mechanism, deep learning-based text classi\ufb01cation (DLTC), is inherently vulnerable to maliciously crafted adversarial texts. To mitigate such vulnerabilities, intensive research has been conducted on strengthening English-based DLTC models. However, the existing defenses are not effective for Chinese-based DLTC models, due to the unique sparseness, diversity, and variation of the Chinese language. In this paper, we bridge this striking gap by presenting T EXT S HIELD , a new adversarial defense framework speci\ufb01cally designed for Chinese-based DLTC models. T EXT S HIELD differs from previous work in several key aspects: (i) generic \u2013 it applies to any Chinese-based DLTC models without requiring re-training; (ii) robust \u2013 it signi\ufb01-cantly reduces the attack success rate even under the setting of adaptive attacks; and (iii) accurate \u2013 it has little impact on the performance of DLTC models over legitimate inputs. Extensive evaluations show that it outperforms both existing methods and the industry-leading platforms. Future work will explore its applicability in broader practical tasks.",

        "abstract": "Password managers (PMs) are considered highly effective tools for increasing security, and a recent study by Pearman et al. (SOUPS'19) highlighted the motivations and barriers to adopting PMs. We expand these findings by replicating Pearman et al.'s protocol and interview instrument applied to a sample of strictly older adults (>60 years of age), as the prior work focused on a predominantly younger cohort. We conducted n=26 semi-structured interviews with PM users, built-in browser/operating system PM users, and non-PM users. The average participant age was 70.4 years. Using the same codebook from Pearman et al., we showcase differences and similarities in PM adoption between the samples, including fears of a single point of failure and the importance of having control over one's private information. Meanwhile, older adults were found to have higher mistrust of cloud storage of passwords and cross-device synchronization. We also highlight PM adoption motivators for older adults, including the power of recommendations from family members and the importance of education and outreach to improve familiarity.",

        "abstract": "Password security hinges on an accurate understanding of the techniques adopted by attackers. However, current studies mostly rely on probabilistic password models that are imperfect proxies of real-world guessing strategies. The main reason is that attackers rely on very pragmatic approaches such as dictionary attacks. Unfortunately, it is inherently difficult to correctly model those methods. To be representative, dictionary attacks must be thoughtfully configured according to a process that requires an expertise that cannot be easily replicated in password studies. The consequence of inaccurately calibrating those attacks is the unreliability of password security estimates, impaired by measurement bias. \nIn the present work, we introduce new guessing techniques that make dictionary attacks consistently more resilient to inadequate configurations. Our framework allows dictionary attacks to self-heal and converge towards optimal attacks' performance, requiring no supervision or domain-knowledge. To achieve this: (1) We use a deep neural network to model and then simulate the proficiency of expert adversaries. (2) Then, we introduce automatic dynamic strategies within dictionary attacks to mimic experts' ability to adapt their guessing strategies on the fly by incorporating knowledge on their targets. Our techniques enable robust and sound password strength estimates, eventually reducing bias in modeling real-world threats in password security.",

        "title": "Hermes Attack: Steal DNN Models with Lossless Inference Accuracy",
        "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) models become one of the most valuable enterprise assets due to their critical roles in all aspects of applications. With the trend of privatization deployment of DNN models, the data leakage of the DNN models is becoming increasingly serious and widespread. All existing model-extraction attacks can only leak parts of targeted DNN models with low accuracy or high overhead. In this paper, we first identify a new attack surface -- unencrypted PCIe traffic, to leak DNN models. Based on this new attack surface, we propose a novel model-extraction attack, namely Hermes Attack, which is the first attack to fully steal the whole victim DNN model. The stolen DNN models have the same hyper-parameters, parameters, and semantically identical architecture as the original ones. It is challenging due to the closed-source CUDA runtime, driver, and GPU internals, as well as the undocumented data structures and the loss of some critical semantics in the PCIe traffic. Additionally, there are millions of PCIe packets with numerous noises and chaos orders. Our Hermes Attack addresses these issues by huge reverse engineering efforts and reliable semantic reconstruction, as well as skillful packet selection and order correction. We implement a prototype of the Hermes Attack, and evaluate two sequential DNN models (i.e., MINIST and VGG) and one consequential DNN model (i.e., ResNet) on three NVIDIA GPU platforms, i.e., NVIDIA Geforce GT 730, NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1080 Ti, and NVIDIA Geforce RTX 2080 Ti. The evaluation results indicate that our scheme is able to efficiently and completely reconstruct ALL of them with making inferences on any one image. Evaluated with Cifar10 test dataset that contains 10,000 images, the experiment results show that the stolen models have the same inference accuracy as the original ones (i.e., lossless inference accuracy).",

        "abstract": "Card-not-present credit card fraud costs businesses billions of dollars a year. In this paper, we present Boxer, a mobile SDK and server that enables apps to combat card-not-present fraud by scanning cards and verifying that they are genuine. Boxer analyzes the images from these scans, looking for telltale signs of attacks, and introduces a novel abstraction on top of modern security hardware for complementary protection. Currently, 323 apps have integrated Boxer, and tens of them have deployed it to production, including some large, popular, and international apps, resulting in Boxer scanning over 10 million real cards already. Our evaluation of Boxer from one of these deployments shows ten cases of real attacks that our novel hardware-based abstraction detects. Additionally, from the same deployment, without letting in any fraud, Boxer\u2019s card scanning recovers 89% of the good users whom the app would have blocked. In another evaluation of Boxer, we run our image analysis models against images from real users and show an accuracy of 96% and 100% on the two models that we use.",

Over the past two years it has become clear that operators have sold and leaked identity and location data of hundreds of millions of mobile users. \nIn this paper, we examine how to improve privacy in modern mobile networks. We take an end-to-end perspective on today's cellular architecture and find key points of decoupling that enable a new type of operator to offer privacy-enhanced service with no changes to physical infrastructure and without direct cooperation from existing operators. \nWe describe Pretty Good Phone Privacy (PGPP) and demonstrate how our modified backend stack (EPC) works with real phones to provide ordinary yet privacy-preserving connectivity. We explore inherent privacy and efficiency tradeoffs in a simulation of a large metropolitan region. We show how PGPP maintains today's control overheads while significantly improving user identity and location privacy.",

        "abstract": "Perception plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving systems, which utilizes onboard sensors like cameras and LiDARs (Light Detection and Ranging) to assess surroundings. Recent studies have demonstrated that LiDAR-based perception is vulnerable to spoofing attacks, in which adversaries spoof a fake vehicle in front of a victim self-driving car by strategically transmitting laser signals to the victim's LiDAR sensor. However, existing attacks suffer from effectiveness and generality limitations. In this work, we perform the first study to explore the general vulnerability of current LiDAR-based perception architectures and discover that the ignored occlusion patterns in LiDAR point clouds make self-driving cars vulnerable to spoofing attacks. We construct the first black-box spoofing attack based on our identified vulnerability, which universally achieves around 80% mean success rates on all target models. We perform the first defense study, proposing CARLO to mitigate LiDAR spoofing attacks. CARLO detects spoofed data by treating ignored occlusion patterns as invariant physical features, which reduces the mean attack success rate to 5.5%. Meanwhile, we take the first step towards exploring a general architecture for robust LiDAR-based perception, and propose SVF that embeds the neglected physical features into end-to-end learning. SVF further reduces the mean attack success rate to around 2.3%.",

        "abstract": "Data flow analysis (e.g., dynamic taint analysis) has proven to be useful for guiding fuzzers to explore hard-to-reach code and find vulnerabilities. However, traditional taint analysis is labor-intensive, inaccurate and slow, affecting the fuzzing efficiency. Apart from taint, few data flow features are utilized. In this paper, we proposed a data flow sensitive fuzzing solution GREYONE. We first utilize the classic feature taint to guide fuzzing. A lightweight and sound fuzzing-driven taint inference (FTI) is adopted to infer taint of variables, by monitoring their value changes while mutating input bytes during fuzzing. With the taint, we propose a novel input prioritization model to determine which branch to explore, which bytes to mutate and how to mutate. Further, we use another data flow feature constraint conformance, i.e., distance of tainted variables to values expected in untouched branches, to tune the evolution direction of fuzzing. We implemented a prototype of GREYONE and evaluated it on the LAVA data set and 19 real world programs. The results showed that it outperforms various state-of-the-art fuzzers in terms of both code coverage and vulnerability discovery. In the LAVA data set, GREYONE found all listed bugs and 336 more unlisted. In real world programs, GREYONE on average found 2.12X unique program paths and 3.09X unique bugs than state-of-the-art evolutionary fuzzers, including AFL, VUzzer, CollAFL, Angora and Honggfuzz, Moreover, GREYONE on average found 1.2X unique program paths and 1.52X unique bugs than a state-of-the-art symbolic exeuction assisted fuzzer QSYM. In total, it found 105 new security bugs, of which 41 are confirmed by CVE.",

        "abstract": "In today\u2019s DNS infrastructure, DNS forwarders are devices standing in between DNS clients and recursive resolvers. The devices often serve as ingress servers for DNS clients, and instead of resolving queries, they pass the DNS requests to other servers. Because of the advantages and several use cases, DNS forwarders are widely deployed and queried by Internet users. However, studies have shown that DNS for-warders can be more vulnerable devices in the DNS infrastructure. In this paper, we present a cache poisoning attack targeting DNS forwarders. Through this attack, attackers can inject rogue records of arbitrary victim domain names using a controlled domain, and circumvent widely-deployed cache poisoning defences. By performing tests on popular home router models and DNS software, we \ufb01nd several vulnerable implementations, including those of large vendors (e.g., D-Link, Linksys, dnsmasq and MS DNS). Further, through a nationwide measurement, we estimate the population of Chinese mobile clients which are using vulnerable DNS for-warders. We have been reporting the issue to the affected vendors, and so far have received positive feedback from three of them. Our work further demonstrates that DNS for-warders can be a soft spot in the DNS infrastructure, and calls for attention as well as implementation guidelines from the community.",

        "title": "Hall Spoofing: A Non-Invasive DoS Attack on Grid-Tied Solar Inverter",
        "abstract": "Grid-tied solar inverters continue to proliferate rapidly to tackle the growing environmental challenges. Nowadays, different smart sensors and transducers are tightly integrated with the grid-tied inverter. This integration opens the \"Pandora\u2019s Box\" of unknown threats that could come from very unconventional ways. This paper demonstrates a noninvasive attack that could come by spoofing the Hall sensor of an inverter in a stealthy way by using an external magnetic field. We demonstrate how an attacker can camouflage his/her attack tool and place it near a target inverter. In doing so, he/she can intentionally perturb grid voltage and frequency and can inject false real and reactive power to the grid. We also show the consequences of the attack on a scaled-down testbed of a power grid with a commercial 140 W grid-tied inverter from Texas Instruments. We are able to achieve a 31.52% change in output voltage, 3.16x (-6dB to -11dB) increase in lowfrequency harmonics power, and 3.44x increase in real power. Moreover, we introduce a duty-cycle variation approach for a noninvasive adversarial control that can change the inverter voltage up to 34% and real power up to 38%. We discuss the feasibility of using a 100 kW inverter through discussion. This provides insights behind the generalization of the attack model. In addition, the commercial power system simulation tool Etap 19.0.1 is used to simulate the impact of the attack on a 2.3 MW power grid. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first methodology that highlights the possibility of such an attack that might lead to grid blackout in a weak grid.",

        "title": "Frankenstein: Advanced Wireless Fuzzing to Exploit New Bluetooth Escalation Targets",
        "abstract": "Wireless communication standards and implementations have a troubled history regarding security. Since most implementations and firmwares are closed-source, fuzzing remains one of the main methods to uncover Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in deployed systems. Generic over-the-air fuzzing suffers from several shortcomings, such as constrained speed, limited repeatability, and restricted ability to debug. In this paper, we present Frankenstein, a fuzzing framework based on advanced firmware emulation, which addresses these shortcomings. Frankenstein brings firmware dumps \"back to life\", and provides fuzzed input to the chip's virtual modem. The speed-up of our new fuzzing method is sufficient to maintain interoperability with the attached operating system, hence triggering realistic full-stack behavior. We demonstrate the potential of Frankenstein by finding three zero-click vulnerabilities in the Broadcom and Cypress Bluetooth stack, which is used in most Apple devices, many Samsung smartphones, the Raspberry Pis, and many others. \nGiven RCE on a Bluetooth chip, attackers may escalate their privileges beyond the chip's boundary. We uncover a Wi-Fi/Bluetooth coexistence issue that crashes multiple operating system kernels and a design flaw in the Bluetooth 5.2 specification that allows link key extraction from the host. Turning off Bluetooth will not fully disable the chip, making it hard to defend against RCE attacks. Moreover, when testing our chip-based vulnerabilities on those devices, we find BlueFrag, a chip-independent Android RCE.",

Unlike previous attempts, which simply automate the execution of known attacks, we consider a more challenging problem: to programmatically derive a novel attack strategy, given only a machine-readable description of the plaintext veri\ufb01cation function and the malleability characteristics of the encryption scheme. We present a new set of algorithms that use SAT and SMT solvers to reason deeply over the design of the system, producing an automated attack strategy that can entirely decrypt protected messages. Developing our algorithms required us to adapt techniques from a diverse range of research \ufb01elds, as well as to explore and develop new ones. We implement our algorithms using existing theory solvers. The result is a practical tool called Delphinium that succeeds against real-world and contrived format oracles. To our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst work to automatically derive such complex chosen ciphertext attacks.",

In this paper, we isolate and identify these detection gaps by measuring the end-to-end life cycle of large-scale phishing attacks. We develop a unique framework\u2014 Golden Hour \u2014that allows us to passively measure victim traffic to phishing pages while proactively protectingtensofthousandsofaccountsintheprocess. Overa one yearperiod,ournetworkmonitorrecorded4.8 million victims who visitedphishing pages,excluding crawlertraffic. We use these events and related data sources to dissect phishing campaigns: from the time they first come online, to email distribution, to visitor traffic, to ecosystem detection, and finally to account compromise. We find the average campaign from startto the lastvictim takes just21 hours. Atleast7.42% ofvisi-tors supply their credentials and ultimately experience a compromise and subsequent fraudulent transaction. Furthermore, a smallcollection ofhighlysuccessfulcampaigns are responsible for 89.13% of victims. Based on our findings, we outline potential opportunities to respond to these sophisticated attacks.",

        "abstract": "The adversarial model presented by trusted execution environments (TEEs) has prompted researchers to investigate unusual attack vectors. One particularly powerful class of controlled-channel attacks abuses page-table modifications to reliably track enclave memory accesses at a page-level granularity. In contrast to noisy microarchitectural timing leakage, this line of deterministic controlled-channel attacks abuses indispensable architectural interfaces and hence cannot be mitigated by tweaking microarchitectural resources. \nWe propose an innovative controlled-channel attack, named CopyCat, that deterministically counts the number of instructions executed within a single enclave code page. We show that combining the instruction counts harvested by CopyCat with traditional, coarse-grained page-level leakage allows the accurate reconstruction of enclave control flow at a maximal instruction-level granularity. CopyCat can identify intra-page and intra-cache line branch decisions that ultimately may only differ in a single instruction, underscoring that even extremely subtle control flow deviations can be deterministically leaked from secure enclaves. We demonstrate the improved resolution and practicality of CopyCat on Intel SGX in an extensive study of single-trace and deterministic attacks against cryptographic implementations, and give novel algorithmic attacks to perform single-trace key extraction that exploit subtle vulnerabilities in the latest versions of widely-used cryptographic libraries. Our findings highlight the importance of stricter verification of cryptographic implementations, especially in the context of TEEs.",

        "abstract": "Since 2016, with a strong push from the Government of India, smartphone-based payment apps have become mainstream, with over $50 billion transacted through these apps in 2018. Many of these apps use a common infrastructure introduced by the Indian government, called the Uni\ufb01ed Payments Interface (UPI), but there has been no security analysis of this critical piece of infrastructure that supports money transfers. This paper uses a principled methodology to do a detailed security analysis of the UPI protocol by reverse-engineering the design of this protocol through seven popular UPI apps. We discover previously-unreported multi-factor authentication design-level \ufb02aws in the UPI 1.0 speci\ufb01cation that can lead to signi\ufb01cant attacks when combined with an installed attacker-controlled application. In an extreme version of the attack, the \ufb02aws could allow a victim\u2019s bank account to be linked and emptied, even if a victim had never used a UPI app. The potential attacks were scalable and could be done remotely. We discuss our methodology and detail how we overcame challenges in reverse-engineering this unpublished application layer protocol, including that all UPI apps undergo a rigorous security review in India and are designed to resist analysis. The work resulted in several CVEs, and a key attack vector that we reported was later addressed in UPI 2.0.",

        "abstract": "A major impediment to practical symbolic execution is speed, especially when compared to near-native speed solutions like fuzz testing. We propose a compilation-based approach to symbolic execution that performs better than state-of-the-art implementations by orders of magnitude. We present S YM CC, an LLVM-based C and C++ compiler that builds concolic execution right into the binary. It can be used by software developers as a drop-in replacement for clang and clang++ , and we show how to add support for other languages with little effort. In comparison with KLEE, S YM CC is faster by up to three orders of magnitude and an average factor of 12. It also outperforms QSYM, a system that recently showed great performance improvements over other implementations, by up to two orders of magnitude and an average factor of 10. Using it on real-world software, we found that our approach consistently achieves higher coverage, and we discovered two vulnerabilities in the heavily tested OpenJPEG project, which have been con\ufb01rmed by the project maintainers and assigned CVE identi\ufb01ers.",

        "title": "SHA-1 is a Shambles: First Chosen-Prefix Collision on SHA-1 and Application to the PGP Web of Trust",
        "abstract": "The SHA-1 hash function was designed in 1995 and has been widely used during two decades. A theoretical collision attack was first proposed in 2004 [29], but due to its high complexity it was only implemented in practice in 2017, using a large GPU cluster [23]. More recently, an almost practical chosen-prefix collision attack against SHA-1 has been proposed [12]. This more powerful attack allows to build colliding messages with two arbitrary prefixes, which is much more threatening for real protocols. In this paper, we report the first practical implementation of this attack, and its impact on real-world security with a PGP/GnuPG impersonation attack. We managed to significantly reduce the complexity of collision attacks against SHA-1: on an Nvidia GTX 970, identical-prefix collisions can now be computed with a complexity (expressed in terms of SHA-1 equivalents on this GPU) of 261.2 rather than 264.7, and chosen-prefix collisions with a complexity of 263.4 rather than 267.1. When renting cheap GPUs, this translates to a cost of US$ 11k for a collision, and US$ 45k for a chosen-prefix collision, within the means of academic researchers. Our actual attack required two months of computations using 900 Nvidia GTX 1060 GPUs. Therefore, the same attacks that have been practical on MD5 since 2009 are now practical on SHA-1. In particular, chosen-prefix collisions can break signature schemes and handshake security in secure channel protocols (TLS, SSH), if generated extremely quickly. We strongly advise to remove SHA-1 from those type of applications as soon as possible. We exemplify our cryptanalysis by creating a pair of PGP/GnuPG keys with different identities, but colliding SHA-1 certificates. A SHA-1 certification of the first key can therefore be transferred to the second key, leading to an impersonation attack. This proves that SHA-1 signatures now offer virtually no security in practice. \u2217https://sha-mbles.github.io/ The legacy branch of GnuPG still uses SHA-1 by default for identity certifications, but after notifying the authors, the modern branch now rejects SHA-1 signatures (the issue is tracked as CVE-2019-14855).",

        "title": "BScout: Direct Whole Patch Presence Test for Java Executables",
        "abstract": "To protect end-users and software from known vulnerabilities, it is crucial to apply security patches to affected executables timely. To this end, patch presence tests are proposed with the capability of independently investigating patch application status on a target without source code. Existing work on patch presence testing adopts a signature-based approach. To make a trade-off between the uniqueness and the stability of the signature, existing work is limited to use a small and localized patch snippet (instead of the whole patch) for signature generation, so they are inherently unreliable. In light of this, we present BSCOUT, which directly checks the presence of a whole patch in Java executables without generating signatures. BSCOUT features several new techniques to bridge the semantic gap between source code and bytecode instructions during the testing, and accurately checks the fine-grained patch semantics in the whole target executable. We evaluate BScout with 194 CVEs from the Android framework and third-party libraries. The results show that it achieves remarkable accuracy with and without line number information (i.e., debug information) presented in a target executable. We further apply BSCOUT to perform a large-scale patch application practice study with 2,506 Android system images from 7 vendors. Our study reveals many findings that have not yet been reported.",

        "abstract": "Author(s): Singh, Akash Deep | Advisor(s): Srivastava, Mani B | Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of low-cost wireless sensors in smart homes and buildings has enabled users to easily deploy systems to remotely monitor and control their environments. However, this raises privacy concerns for third-party occupants, such as a hotel room guest who may be unaware of deployed clandestine sensors. Previous methods focused on specific modalities such as detecting cameras but do not provide a generalizable and comprehensive method to capture arbitrary sensors which may be \"spying\" on a user. In this work, we seek to determine whether one can walk in a room and detect any wireless sensor monitoring an individual. As such, we propose SnoopDog, a framework to not only detect wireless sensors that are actively monitoring a user, but also classify and localize each device. SnoopDog works by establishing causality between patterns in observable wireless traffic and a trusted sensor in the same space, e.g., an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that captures a user's movement. Once causality is established, SnoopDog performs packet inspection to inform the user about the monitoring device. Finally, SnoopDog localizes the clandestine device in a 2D plane using a novel trial-based localization technique. We evaluated SnoopDog across several devices and various modalities and were able to detect causality 96.6% percent of the time, classify suspicious devices with 100% accuracy, and localize devices to a sufficiently reduced sub-space.",

        "title": "Medusa: Microarchitectural Data Leakage via Automated Attack Synthesis",
        "abstract": "In May 2019, a new class of transient execution attack based on Meltdown called microarchitectural data sampling (MDS), was disclosed. MDS enables adversaries to leak secrets across security domains by collecting data from shared CPU resources such as data cache, \ufb01ll buffers, and store buffers. These resources may temporarily hold data that belongs to other processes and privileged contexts, which could falsely be forwarded to memory accesses of an adversary. We perform an in-depth analysis of these Meltdown-style attacks using our novel fuzzing-based approach. We introduce an analysis tool, named Transynther, which mutates the basic block of existing Meltdown variants to generate and evaluate new Meltdown subvariants. We apply Transynther to analyze modern CPUs and better understand the root cause of these attacks. As a result, we \ufb01nd new variants of MDS that only target speci\ufb01c memory operations, e.g., fast string copies. Based on our \ufb01ndings, we propose a new attack, named Medusa, which can leak data from implicit write-combining memory operations. Since Medusa only applies to speci\ufb01c operations, it can be used to pinpoint vulnerable targets. In a case study, we apply Medusa to recover the key during the RSA signing operation. We show that Medusa can leak various parts of an RSA key during the base64 decoding stage. Then we build leakage templates and recover full RSA keys by employing lattice-based cryptanalysis techniques.",

        "abstract": "Smartphones and their applications have become a predominant way of computing, and it is only natural that they have become an important part of \ufb01nancial transaction technology. However, applications asking users to enter credit card numbers have been largely overlooked by prior studies, which frequently report pervasive security and privacy concerns in the general mobile application ecosystem. Such applications are particularly security-sensitive, and they are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). In this paper, we design a tool called Cardpliance , which bridges the semantics of the graphical user interface with static program analysis to capture relevant requirements from PCI DSS. We use Cardpliance to study 358 popular applications from Google Play that ask the user to enter a credit card number. Overall, we found that 1.67 % of the 358 applications are not compliant with PCI DSS, with vulnerabilities including improperly storing credit card numbers and card veri\ufb01cation codes. These \ufb01ndings paint a largely positive picture of the state of PCI DSS compliance of popular Android applications.",

        "abstract": "Due to the open nature of voice assistants\u2019 input channels, adversaries could easily record people\u2019s use of voice commands, and replay them to spoof voice assistants. To mitigate such spoofing attacks, we present a highly efficient voice liveness detection solution called \u201cVoid.\u201d Void detects voice spoofing attacks using the differences in spectral power between live-human voices and voices replayed through speakers. In contrast to existing approaches that use multiple deep learning models, and thousands of features, Void uses a single classification model with just 97 features. We used two datasets to evaluate its performance: (1) 255,173 voice samples generated with 120 participants, 15 playback devices and 12 recording devices, and (2) 18,030 publicly available voice samples generated with 42 participants, 26 playback devices and 25 recording devices. Void achieves equal error rate of 0.3% and 11.6% in detecting voice replay attacks for each dataset, respectively. Compared to a state of the art, deep learning-based solution that achieves 7.4% error rate in that public dataset, Void uses 153 times less memory and is about 8 times faster in detection. When combined with a Gaussian Mixture Model that uses Melfrequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) as classification features \u2013 MFCC is already being extracted and used as the main feature in speech recognition services \u2013 Void achieves 8.7% error rate on the public dataset. Moreover, Void is resilient against hidden voice command, inaudible voice command, voice synthesis, equalization manipulation attacks, and combining replay attacks with live-human voices achieving about 99.7%, 100%, 90.2%, 86.3%, and 98.2% detection rates for those attacks, respectively.",

        "title": "SkillExplorer: Understanding the Behavior of Skills in Large Scale",
        "abstract": "Smart speakers have been popularly used around the world recently, mainly due to the convenience brought from the virtual personal assistant (VPA) which offers interactive actions through the convenient voice commands from users. Besides the built-in capabilities, VPA services can be further extended by third-party developers through skills. Similar to smartphone applications on Android and iOS markets, skills are also available on markets (e.g., Amazon, Google), attracting users together with malicious developers. Recent researches discover that malicious developers are able to route users\u2019 requests to malicious skills without users\u2019 consent by creating skills with similar names of legitimate ones. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no prior research that systematically explores the interaction behaviors of skills, mainly due to the challenges in handling skills\u2019 inputs/outputs which are in the form of natural languages. In this paper, we propose the first systematic study on behaviors of skills, which is achieved by a suite of new grammar-based techniques including utterance extraction, question understanding, and answer generation specifically designed for skills. We build an interactive system called SkillExplorer and analyze 28,904 skills from the Amazon market and 1,897 actions from the Google market. Among these skills, we find that 1,141 skills request users\u2019 private information without following developer specifications, which are actually demanded by markets. 68 skills continue to eavesdrop users\u2019 private conversations, even after users have sent the command to stop them.",

        "title": "FANS: Fuzzing Android Native System Services via Automated Interface Analysis",
        "abstract": "Android native system services provide essential supports and fundamental functionalities for user apps. Finding vulnerabilities in them is crucial for Android security. Fuzzing is one of the most popular vulnerability discovery solutions, yet faces several challenges when applied to Android native system services. First, such services are invoked via a special inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism, namely binder , via service-speci\ufb01c interfaces. Thus, the fuzzer has to recognize all interfaces and generate interface-speci\ufb01c test cases automatically. Second, effective test cases should satisfy the interface model of each interface. Third, the test cases should also satisfy the semantic requirements, including variable dependencies and interface dependencies. In this paper, we propose an automated generation-based fuzzing solution FANS to \ufb01nd vulnerabilities in Android native system services. It \ufb01rst collects all interfaces in target services and uncovers deep nested multi-level interfaces to test. Then, it automatically extracts interface models, including feasible transaction code, variable names and types in the transaction data, from the abstract syntax tree (AST) of target interfaces. Further, it infers variable dependencies in transactions via the variable name and type knowledge, and infers interface dependencies via the generation and use relationship. Finally, it employs the interface models and dependency knowledge to generate sequences of transactions, which have valid formats and semantics, to test interfaces of target services. We implemented a prototype of FANS from scratch and evaluated it on six smartphones equipped with a recent version of Android, i.e., android-9.0.0_r46 , and found 30 unique vulnerabilities deduplicated from thousands of crashes, of which 20 have been con\ufb01rmed by Google. Surprisingly, we also discovered 138 unique Java exceptions during fuzzing.",

        "title": "Graph Backdoor",
        "abstract": "One intriguing property of deep neural networks (DNNs) is their inherent vulnerability to backdoor attacks -- a trojaned model responds to trigger-embedded inputs in a highly predictable manner while functioning normally otherwise. Surprisingly, despite the plethora of prior work on DNNs for continuous data (e.g., images), little is known about the vulnerability of graph neural networks (GNNs) for discrete-structured data (e.g., graphs), which is highly concerning given their increasing use in security-sensitive domains. To bridge this gap, we present GTA, the first backdoor attack on GNNs. Compared with prior work, GTA departs in significant ways: graph-oriented -- it defines triggers as specific subgraphs, including both topological structures and descriptive features, entailing a large design spectrum for the adversary; input-tailored -- it dynamically adapts triggers to individual graphs, thereby optimizing both attack effectiveness and evasiveness; downstream model-agnostic -- it can be readily launched without knowledge regarding downstream models or fine-tuning strategies; and attack-extensible -- it can be instantiated for both transductive (e.g., node classification) and inductive (e.g., graph classification) tasks, constituting severe threats for a range of security-critical applications (e.g., toxic chemical classification). Through extensive evaluation using benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of GTA: for instance, on pre-trained, off-the-shelf GNNs, GTA attains over 99.2% attack success rate with merely less than 0.3% accuracy drop. We further provide analytical justification for its effectiveness and discuss potential countermeasures, pointing to several promising research directions.",

In six experiment deployments over nine months, we systematically launchandreport2,862 new (innocuous) phishing websites to evaluate the performance (speed and coverage) and consistency of blacklists, with the goal of improving them. We show that methodical long-term empirical measurements are an e ective strategy for proactively detecting weaknesses in the anti-phishing ecosystem. Through our experiments, we identify and disclose several such weaknesses, including a class of behavior-based JavaScript evasion that blacklists were unable to detect. We nd that enhanced protections on mobile devices and the expansion of evidence-based reporting protocols are critical ecosystem improvements that could better protect users against modern phishing attacks, which routinely seek to evade detection infrastructure.",

        "abstract": "Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks threaten user privacy on anonymity networks because they can be used by network surveillants to identify the webpage being visited by extracting features from network traf\ufb01c. A number of defenses have been put forward to mitigate the threat of WF, but they are \ufb02awed: some have been defeated by stronger WF attacks, some are too expensive in overhead, while others are impractical to deploy. In this work, we propose two novel zero-delay lightweight defenses, FRONT and GLUE. We \ufb01nd that WF attacks rely on the feature-rich trace front, so FRONT focuses on obfus-cating the trace front with dummy packets. It also random-izes the number and distribution of dummy packets for trace-to-trace randomness to impede the attacker\u2019s learning process. GLUE adds dummy packets between separate traces so that they appear to the attacker as a long consecutive trace, rendering the attacker unable to \ufb01nd their start or end points, let alone classify them. Our experiments show that with 33% data overhead, FRONT outperforms the best known lightweight defense, WTF-PAD, which has a similar data overhead. With around 22%\u201344% data overhead, GLUE can lower the accuracy and precision of the best WF attacks to a degree comparable with the best heavyweight defenses. Both defenses have no latency overhead.",

        "title": "HALucinator: Firmware Re-hosting Through Abstraction Layer Emulation",
        "abstract": "Given the increasing ubiquity of online embedded devices, analyzing their \ufb01rmware is important to security, privacy, and safety. The tight coupling between hardware and \ufb01rmware and the diversity found in embedded systems makes it hard to perform dynamic analysis on \ufb01rmware. However, \ufb01rmware developers regularly develop code using abstractions, such as Hardware Abstraction Layers (HALs), to simplify their job. We leverage such abstractions as the basis for the re-hosting and analysis of \ufb01rmware. By providing high-level replacements for HAL functions (a process termed High-Level Emulation \u2013 HLE ), we decouple the hardware from the \ufb01rmware. This approach works by \ufb01rst locating the library functions in a \ufb01rmware sample, through binary analysis, and then providing generic implementations of these functions in a full-system emulator. Wepresent these ideas in a prototype system, HALucinator, able to re-host \ufb01rmware, and allow the virtual device to be used normally. First, we introduce extensions to existing library matching techniques that are needed to identify library functions in binary \ufb01rmware, to reduce collisions, and for inferring additional function names. Next, we demonstrate the re-hosting process, through the use of simpli\ufb01ed handlers and peripheral models , which make the process fast, \ufb02exible, and portable between \ufb01rmware samples",

        "abstract": "Peer-to-peer networks are an attractive alternative to classical client-server architectures in several fields of application such as voice-over-IP telephony and file sharing. Recently, a new peer-to-peer solution called the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) has attracted attention, which promises to re-decentralise the Web. Being increasingly used as a stand-alone application, IPFS has also emerged as the technical backbone of various other decentralised solutions and was even used to evade censorship. Decentralised applications serving millions of users rely on IPFS as one of their crucial building blocks. This popularity makes IPFS attractive for large-scale attacks. We have identified a conceptual issue in one of IPFS's core libraries and demonstrate their exploitation by means of a successful end-to-end attack. We evaluated this attack against the IPFS reference implementation on the public IPFS network, which is used by the average user to share and consume IPFS content. Results obtained from mounting this attack on live IPFS nodes show that arbitrary IPFS nodes can be eclipsed, i.e. isolated from the network, with moderate effort and limited resources. Compared to similar works, we show that our attack scales linearly even beyond current network sizes and can disrupt the entire public IPFS network with alarmingly low effort. The vulnerability set described in this paper has been assigned CVE-2020-10937. Responsible disclosure procedures are currently being carried out and have led to mitigations being deployed, with additional fixes to be rolled out in future releases.",

        "abstract": "The Estonian electronic identity card (ID card) is considered to be one of the most successful deployments of smart cardbased national ID card systems in the world. The publickey cryptography and private keys stored on the card enable Estonian ID card holders to access e-services, give legally binding digital signatures and even cast an i-vote in national elections. In this paper, we describe several security flaws found in the ID card manufacturing process. The flaws have been discovered by analyzing public-key certificates that have been collected from the public ID card certificate repository. In particular, we find that in some cases, contrary to the security requirements, the ID card manufacturer has generated private keys outside the chip. In several cases, copies of the same private key have been imported in the ID cards of different cardholders, allowing them to impersonate each other. In addition, as a result of a separate flaw in the manufacturing process, corrupted RSA public key moduli have been included in the certificates, which in one case led to the full recovery of the corresponding private key. This paper describes the discovery process of these findings and the incident response taken by the authorities.",

        "abstract": "Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) introduced new instructions to switch the processor to enclave mode which protects it from introspection. While the enclave mode strongly protects the memory and the state of the processor, it cannot withstand memory corruption errors inside the enclave code. In this paper, we show that the attack surface of SGX enclaves provides new challenges for enclave developers as exploitable memory corruption vulnerabilities are easily introduced into enclave code. We develop TeeRex to automatically analyze enclave binary code for vulnerabilities introduced at the host-to-enclave boundary by means of symbolic execution. Our evaluation on public enclave binaries reveal that many of them suffer from memory corruption errors allowing an attacker to corrupt function pointers or perform arbitrary memory writes. As we will show, TeeRex features a specifically tailored framework for SGX enclaves that allows simple proof-of-concept exploit construction to assess the discovered vulnerabilities. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities in multiple enclaves, including enclaves developed by Intel, Baidu, and WolfSSL, as well as biometric fingerprint software deployed on popular laptop brands.",

        "abstract": "In the 2018 midterm elections, West Virginia became the \ufb01rst state in the U.S. to allow select voters to cast their ballot on a mobile phone via a proprietary app called \u201cVoatz.\u201d Although there is no public formal description of Voatz\u2019s security model, the company claims that election security and integrity are maintained through the use of a permissioned blockchain, biometrics, a mixnet, and hardware-backed key storage modules on the user\u2019s device. In this work, we present the \ufb01rst public security analysis of Voatz, based on a reverse engineering of their Android application and the minimal available documentation of the system. We performed a clean-room reimplementation of Voatz\u2019s server and present an analysis of the election process as visible from the app itself. We \ufb01nd that Voatz has vulnerabilities that allow different kinds of adversaries to alter, stop, or expose a user\u2019s vote, including a sidechannel attack in which a completely passive network adversary can potentially recover a user\u2019s secret ballot. We additionally \ufb01nd that Voatz has a number of privacy issues stemming from their use of third party services for crucial app functionality. Our \ufb01ndings serve as a concrete illustration of the common wisdom against Internet voting, and of the importance of transparency to the legitimacy of elections.",

        "abstract": "The introduction of smart contracts has significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in cryptocurrencies. Smart contracts are programs who live on the blockchain, governing the flow of money. However, the promise of monetary gain has attracted miscreants, resulting in spectacular hacks which resulted in the loss of millions worth of currency. In response, several powerful static analysis tools were developed to address these problems. We surveyed eight recently proposed static analyzers for Ethereum smart contracts and found that none of them captures all relevant features of the Ethereum ecosystem. For example, we discovered that a precise memory model is missing and inter-contract analysis is only partially supported. Based on these insights, we present the design and implementation of ETHBMC, a bounded model checker based on symbolic execution which provides a precise model of the Ethereum network. We demonstrate its capabilities in a series of experiments. First, we compare against the eight aforementioned tools, showing that even relatively simple toy examples can obstruct other analyzers. Further proving that precise modeling is indispensable, we leverage ETHBMC capabilities for automatic vulnerability scanning.We perform a large-scale analysis of roughly 2.2 million accounts currently active on the blockchain and automatically generate 5,905 valid inputs which trigger a vulnerability. From these, 1,989 can destroy a contract at will (so called suicidal contracts) and the rest can be used by an adversary to arbitrarily extract money. Finally, we compare our large-scale analysis against two previous analysis runs, finding significantly more inputs (22.8%) than previous approaches.",

        "abstract": "The wide deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in high-performance cloud computing platforms has emerged field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) as a popular choice of accelerator to boost performance due to its hardware reprogramming flexibility. To improve the efficiency of hardware resource utilization, growing efforts have been invested in FPGA virtualization, enabling the co-existence of multiple independent tenants in a shared FPGA chip. Such a multi-tenant FPGA setup for DNN acceleration potentially exposes the DNN interference task under severe threat from malicious users. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to explore DNN model vulnerabilities in multi-tenant FPGAs. We propose a novel adversarial attack framework: Deep-Dup, in which the adversarial tenant can inject faults to the DNN model of victim tenant in FPGA. Specifically, she can aggressively overload the shared power distribution system of FPGA with malicious power-plundering circuits, achieving adversarial weight duplication (AWD) hardware attack that duplicates certain DNN weight packages during data transmission between off-chip memory and on-chip buffer, with the objective to hijack DNN function of the victim tenant. Further, to identify the most vulnerable DNN weight packages for a given malicious objective, we propose a generic vulnerable weight package searching algorithm, called Progressive Differential Evolution Search (P-DES), which is, for the first time, adaptive to both deep learning white-box and black-box attack models. Unlike prior works only working in a deep learning white-box setup, our adaptiveness mainly comes from the fact that the proposed P-DES does not require any gradient information of DNN model.",

        "title": "EcoFuzz: Adaptive Energy-Saving Greybox Fuzzing as a Variant of the Adversarial Multi-Armed Bandit",
        "abstract": "Fuzzing is one of the most effective approaches for identifying security vulnerabilities. As a state-of-the-art coverage-based greybox fuzzer, AFL is a highly effective and widely used technique. However, AFL allocates excessive energy (i.e., the number of test cases generated by the seed) to seeds that exercise the high-frequency paths and can not adaptively adjust the energy allocation, thus wasting a signi\ufb01cant amount of energy. Moreover, the current Markov model for modeling coverage-based greybox fuzzing is not profound enough. This paper presents a variant of the Adversarial Multi-Armed Bandit model for modeling AFL\u2019s power schedule process. We \ufb01rst explain the challenges in AFL\u2019s scheduling algorithm by using the reward probability that generates a test case for discovering a new path. Moreover, we illustrated the three states of the seeds set and developed a unique adaptive scheduling algorithm as well as a probability-based search strategy. These approaches are implemented on top of AFL in an adaptive energy-saving greybox fuzzer called EcoFuzz. EcoFuzz is examined against other six AFL-type tools on 14 real-world subjects over 490 CPU days. According to the results, EcoFuzz could attain 214% of the path coverage of AFL with reducing 32% test cases generation of that of AFL. Besides, EcoFuzz identi\ufb01ed 12 vulnerabilities in GNU Binutils and other software. We also extended EcoFuzz to test some IoT devices and found a new vulnerability in the SNMP component.",

        "abstract": "Commercial threat intelligence is thought to provide unmatched coverage on attacker behavior, but it is out of reach for many organizations due to its hefty price tag. This paper presents the first empirical assessment of the services of commercial threat intelligence providers. For two leading vendors, we describe what these services consist of and compare their indicators with each other. There is almost no overlap between them, nor with four large open threat intelligence feeds. Even for 22 specific threat actors \u2013 which both vendors claim to track \u2013 we find an average overlap of only 2.5% to 4.0% between the indicator feeds. The small number of overlapping indicators show up in the feed of the other vendor with a delay of, on average, a month. These findings raise questions on the coverage and timeliness of paid threat intelligence. We also conducted 14 interviews with security professionals that use paid threat intelligence. We find that value in this market is understood differently than prior work on quality metrics has assumed. Poor coverage and small volume appear less of a problem to customers. They seem to be optimizing for the workflow of their scarce resource \u2013 analyst time \u2013 rather than for the detection of threats. Respondents evaluate TI mostly through informal processes and heuristics, rather than the quantitative metrics that research has proposed.",

Despite wide-spread anec-dotal discussion of the problem, many important questions remain unanswered. In this paper, we present the \ufb01rst large-scale, longitudinal analysis of unsolicited calls to a honeypot of up to 66,606 lines over 11 months. From call metadata we characterize the long-term trends of unsolicited calls, develop the \ufb01rst techniques to measure voicemail spam, wangiri attacks, and identify unexplained high-volume call incidences. Additionally, we mechanically answer a subset of the call attempts we receive to cluster related calls into operational campaigns, allowing us to characterize how these campaigns use telephone numbers. Critically, we \ufb01nd no evidence that answering unsolicited calls increases the amount of unsolicited calls received, overturning popular wisdom. We also \ufb01nd that we can reliably isolate individual call campaigns, in the process revealing the extent of two distinct Social Security scams while empirically demonstrating the majority of campaigns rarely reuse phone numbers. These analyses comprise powerful new tools and perspectives for researchers, investigators, and a beleaguered public.",

        "abstract": "It has become common to publish large (billion parameter) language models that have been trained on private datasets. This paper demonstrates that in such settings, an adversary can perform a training data extraction attack to recover individual training examples by querying the language model. \nWe demonstrate our attack on GPT-2, a language model trained on scrapes of the public Internet, and are able to extract hundreds of verbatim text sequences from the model's training data. These extracted examples include (public) personally identifiable information (names, phone numbers, and email addresses), IRC conversations, code, and 128-bit UUIDs. Our attack is possible even though each of the above sequences are included in just one document in the training data. \nWe comprehensively evaluate our extraction attack to understand the factors that contribute to its success. For example, we find that larger models are more vulnerable than smaller models. We conclude by drawing lessons and discussing possible safeguards for training large language models.",

        "title": "Agamotto: Accelerating Kernel Driver Fuzzing with Lightweight Virtual Machine Checkpoints",
        "abstract": "Kernel-mode drivers are challenging to analyze for vulnerabilities, yet play a critical role in maintaining the security of OS kernels. Their wide attack surface, exposed via both the system call interface and the peripheral interface, is often found to be the most direct attack vector to compromise an OS kernel. Researchers therefore have proposed many fuzzing techniques to \ufb01nd vulnerabilities in kernel drivers. However, the performance of kernel fuzzers is still lacking, for reasons such as prolonged execution of kernel code, interference be-tween test inputs, and kernel crashes. This paper proposes lightweight virtual machine check-pointing as a new primitive that enables high-throughput kernel driver fuzzing. Our key insight is that kernel driver fuzzers frequently execute similar test cases in a row, and that their performance can be improved by dynamically creating multiple checkpoints while executing test cases and skipping parts of test cases using the created checkpoints. We built a system, dubbed Agamotto, around the virtual machine check-pointing primitive and evaluated it by fuzzing the peripheral attack surface of USB and PCI drivers in Linux. The results are convincing. Agamotto improved the performance of the state-of-the-art kernel fuzzer, Syzkaller, by 66.6% on average in fuzzing 8 USB drivers, and an AFL-based PCI fuzzer by 21.6% in fuzzing 4 PCI drivers, without modifying their underlying input generation algorithm.",

        "title": "Stealing Links from Graph Neural Networks",
        "abstract": "Graph data, such as social networks and chemical networks, contains a wealth of information that can help to build powerful applications. To fully unleash the power of graph data, a family of machine learning models, namely graph neural networks (GNNs), is introduced. Empirical results show that GNNs have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various tasks. \nGraph data is the key to the success of GNNs. High-quality graph is expensive to collect and often contains sensitive information, such as social relations. Various research has shown that machine learning models are vulnerable to attacks against their training data. Most of these models focus on data from the Euclidean space, such as images and texts. Meanwhile, little attention has been paid to the security and privacy risks of graph data used to train GNNs. \nIn this paper, we aim at filling the gap by proposing the first link stealing attacks against graph neural networks. Given a black-box access to a GNN model, the goal of an adversary is to infer whether there exists a link between any pair of nodes in the graph used to train the model. We propose a threat model to systematically characterize the adversary's background knowledge along three dimensions. By combination, we obtain a comprehensive taxonomy of 8 different link stealing attacks. We propose multiple novel methods to realize these attacks. Extensive experiments over 8 real-world datasets show that our attacks are effective at inferring links, e.g., AUC (area under the ROC curve) is above 0.95 in multiple cases.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles are becoming increasingly popular, but their reliance on computer systems to sense and operate in the physical world introduces new security risks. In this paper, we show that the location privacy of an autonomous vehicle may be compromised by software side-channel attacks if localization software shares a hardware platform with an attack program. In particular, we demonstrate that a cache side-channel attack can be used to infer the route or the location of a vehicle that runs the adaptive Monte-Carlo localization (AMCL) algorithm. The main contributions of the paper are as follows. First, we show that adaptive behaviors of perception and control algorithms may introduce new sidechannel vulnerabilities that reveal the physical properties of a vehicle or its environment. Second, we introduce statistical learning models that infer the AMCL algorithm\u2019s state from cache access patterns and predict the route or the location of a vehicle from the trace of the AMCL state. Third, we implement and demonstrate the attack on a realistic software stack using real-world sensor data recorded on city roads. Our findings suggest that autonomous driving software needs strong timing-channel protection for location privacy.",

Our system can securely compute histograms over 300 million items in about 4 minutes, and it can perform sparse matrix factorization, which is commonly used in recommendation systems, on 20 million records in about 6 minutes. 1 Furthermore, in contrast to prior work, our system is secure against a malicious adversary that corrupts one of the computing servers.",

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of the Android ecosystem has led to the fragmentation problem where a wide range of (customized) versions of Android OS exist in the market. This poses a severe security issue as it is very costly for Android vendors to \ufb01x vulnerabilities in their customized Android kernels in time. The recent development of the hot patching technique provides an ideal solution to solve this problem since it can be applied to a wide range of Android kernels without in-terrupting their normal functionalities. However, the current hot patches are written by human experts, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. To this end, we \ufb01rst study the feasibility of automatic patch generation from 373 Android kernel CVEs ranging from 2012 to 2016. Then, we develop an automatic hot patch generation tool, named V ulmet , which produces semantic preserving hot patches by learning from the o \ufb03 cial patches. The key idea of V ulmet is to use the weakest precondition reasoning to transform the changes made by the o \ufb03 cial patches into the hot patch constraints. The experiments have shown that V ulmet can generate correct hot patches for 55 real-world Android kernel CVEs. The hot patches do not a \ufb00 ect the robustness of the kernels and have low performance overhead.",

        "abstract": "With wide adoption of robotic aerial vehicles (RAVs), their accidents increasingly occur, calling for in-depth investigation of such accidents. Unfortunately, an inquiry to \u201cwhy did my drone crash\u201d often ends up with nowhere, if the root cause lies in the RAV\u2019s control program, due to the key challenges in evidence and methodology: (1) Current RAVs\u2019 flight log only records high-level vehicle control states and events, without recording control program execution; (2) The capability of \u201cconnecting the dots\u201d \u2013 from controller anomaly to program variable corruption to program bug location \u2013 is lacking. To address these challenges, we develop MAYDAY, a crossdomain post-accident investigation framework by mapping control model to control program, enabling (1) in-flight logging of control program execution, and (2) traceback to the control-semantic bug that led to an accident, based on controland program-level logs. We have applied MAYDAY to ArduPilot, a popular open-source RAV control program that runs on a wide range of commodity RAVs. Our investigation of 10 RAV accidents caused by real ArduPilot bugs demonstrates that MAYDAY is able to pinpoint the root causes of these accidents within the program with high accuracy and minimum runtime and storage overhead. We also found 4 recently patched bugs still vulnerable and alerted the ArduPilot team.",

        "abstract": "Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) serve a large and increasing portion of today\u2019s web content. Beyond caching, CDNs provide their customers with a variety of services, including protection against DDoS and targeted attacks. As the web shifts from HTTP to HTTPS, CDNs continue to provide such services by also assuming control of their customers\u2019 private keys, thereby breaking a fundamental security principle: private keys must only be known by their owner. We present the design and implementation of Phoenix, the first truly \u201ckeyless CDN\u201d. Phoenix uses secure enclaves (in particular Intel SGX) to host web content, store sensitive key material, apply web application firewalls, and more on otherwise untrusted machines. To support scalability and multitenancy, Phoenix is built around a new architectural primitive which we call conclaves: containers of enclaves. Conclaves make it straightforward to deploy multi-process, scalable, legacy applications. We also develop a filesystem to extend the enclave\u2019s security guarantees to untrusted storage. In its strongest configuration, Phoenix reduces the knowledge of the edge server to that of a traditional on-path HTTPS adversary. We evaluate the performance of Phoenix with a series of microand macro-benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Fuzzing is a testing technique to discover unknown vulnerabilities in software. When applying fuzzing to libraries, the core idea of supplying random input remains unchanged, yet it is non-trivial to achieve good code coverage. Libraries cannot run as standalone programs, but instead are invoked through another application. Triggering code deep in a library remains challenging as specific sequences of API calls are required to build up the necessary state. Libraries are diverse and have unique interfaces that require unique fuzzers, so far written by a human analyst. To address this issue, we present FuzzGen, a tool for automatically synthesizing fuzzers for complex libraries in a given environment. FuzzGen leverages a whole system analysis to infer the library\u2019s interface and synthesizes fuzzers specifically for that library. FuzzGen requires no human interaction and can be applied to a wide range of libraries. Furthermore, the generated fuzzers leverage LibFuzzer to achieve better code coverage and expose bugs that reside deep in the library. FuzzGen was evaluated on Debian and the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) selecting 7 libraries to generate fuzzers. So far, we have found 17 previously unpatched vulnerabilities with 6 assigned CVEs. The generated fuzzers achieve an average of 54.94% code coverage; an improvement of 6.94% when compared to manually written fuzzers, demonstrating the effectiveness and generality of FuzzGen.",

        "title": "Timeless Timing Attacks: Exploiting Concurrency to Leak Secrets over Remote Connections",
        "abstract": "To perform successful remote timing attacks, an adversary typically collects a series of network timing measurements and subsequently performs statistical analysis to reveal a difference in execution time. The number of measurements that must be obtained largely depends on the amount of jitter that the requests and responses are subjected to. In remote timing attacks, a signi\ufb01cant source of jitter is the network path between the adversary and the targeted server, making it practically infeasible to successfully exploit timing side-channels that exhibit only a small difference in execution time. In this paper, we introduce a conceptually novel type of timing attack that leverages the coalescing of packets by network protocols and concurrent handling of requests by applications. These concurrency-based timing attacks infer a relative timing difference by analyzing the order in which responses are returned, and thus do not rely on any absolute timing information. We show how these attacks result in a 100-fold improvement over typical timing attacks performed over the Internet, and can accurately detect timing differences as small as 100ns, similar to attacks launched on a local system. We describe how these timing attacks can be successfully deployed against HTTP/2 webservers, Tor onion services, and EAP-pwd, a popular Wi-Fi authentication method.",

        "title": "AURORA: Statistical Crash Analysis for Automated Root Cause Explanation",
        "abstract": "Given the huge success of automated software testing techniques, a large amount of crashes is found in practice. Identifying the root cause of a crash is a time-intensive endeavor, causing a disproportion between \ufb01nding a crash and \ufb01xing the underlying software fault. To address this problem, various approaches have been proposed that rely on techniques such as reverse execution and backward taint analysis. Still, these techniques are either limited to certain fault types or provide an analyst with assembly instructions, but no context information or explanation of the underlying fault. In this paper, we propose an automated analysis approach that does not only identify the root cause of a given crashing input for a binary executable, but also provides the analyst with context information on the erroneous behavior that characterizes crashing inputs. Starting with a single crashing input, we generate a diverse set of similar inputs that either also crash the program or induce benign behavior. We then trace the program\u2019s states while executing each found input and generate predicates, i. e., simple Boolean expressions that capture behavioral differences between crashing and non-crashing inputs. A statistical analysis of all predicates allows us to identify the predicate pinpointing the root cause, thereby not only revealing the location of the root cause, but also providing an analyst with an explanation of the misbehavior a crash exhibits at this location. We implement our approach in a tool called A URORA and evaluate it on 25 diverse software faults. Our evaluation shows that A URORA is able to uncover root causes even for complex bugs. For example, it succeeded in cases where many millions of instructions were executed between developer \ufb01x and crashing location. In contrast to existing approaches, A URORA is also able to handle bugs with no data dependency between root cause and crash, such as type confusion bugs.",

        "abstract": "WebAssembly is an increasingly popular compilation target designed to run code in browsers and on other platforms safely and securely, by strictly separating code and data, enforcing types, and limiting indirect control \ufb02ow. Still, vulnerabilities in memory-unsafe source languages can translate to vulnerabilities in WebAssembly binaries. In this paper, we analyze to what extent vulnerabilities are exploitable in WebAssembly binaries, and how this compares to native code. We \ufb01nd that many classic vulnerabilities which, due to common mitiga-tions, are no longer exploitable in native binaries, are completely exposed in WebAssembly. Moreover, WebAssembly enables unique attacks, such as overwriting supposedly constant data or manipulating the heap using a stack over\ufb02ow. We present a set of attack primitives that enable an attacker (i) to write arbitrary memory, (ii) to overwrite sensitive data, and (iii) to trigger unexpected behavior by diverting control \ufb02ow or manipulating the host environment. We provide a set of vulnerable proof-of-concept applications along with complete end-to-end exploits, which cover three WebAssembly platforms. An empirical risk assessment on real-world binaries and SPEC CPU programs compiled to WebAssembly shows that our attack primitives are likely to be feasible in practice. Overall, our \ufb01ndings show a perhaps surprising lack of binary security in WebAssembly. We discuss potential protection mechanisms to mitigate the resulting risks.",

        "abstract": "Automated Lane Centering (ALC) systems are convenient and widely deployed today, but also highly security and safety critical. In this work, we are the first to systematically study the security of state-of-the-art deep learning based ALC systems in their designed operational domains under physical-world adversarial attacks. We formulate the problem with a safety-critical attack goal, and a novel and domain-specific attack vector: dirty road patches. To systematically generate the attack, we adopt an optimization-based approach and overcome domain-specific design challenges such as camera frame inter-dependencies due to attack-influenced vehicle control, and the lack of objective function design for lane detection models. We evaluate our attack on a production ALC using 80 scenarios from real-world driving traces. The results show that our attack is highly effective with over 97.5% success rates and less than 0.903 sec average success time, which is substantially lower than the average driver reaction time. This attack is also found (1) robust to various real-world factors such as lighting conditions and view angles, (2) general to different model designs, and (3) stealthy from the driver's view. To understand the safety impacts, we conduct experiments using software-in-the-loop simulation and attack trace injection in a real vehicle. The results show that our attack can cause a 100% collision rate in different scenarios, including when tested with common safety features such as automatic emergency braking. We also evaluate and discuss defenses.",

        "abstract": "Once compromised, server \ufb01rmware can surreptitiously and permanently take over a machine and any stack running thereon, with no hope for recovery, short of hardware-level intervention. To make things worse, modern \ufb01rmware contains millions of lines of unnecessary code and hundreds of unnecessary modules as a result of a long \ufb01rmware supply chain designed to optimize time-to-market and cost, but not security. As a result, off-the-shelf motherboards contain large, unnecessarily complex, closed-source vulnerability surfaces that can completely and irreversibly compromise systems. In this work, we address this problem by dramatically and automatically reducing the vulnerability surface. DECAF is an extensible platform for automatically pruning a wide class of commercial UEFI \ufb01rmware. DECAF intelligently runs dynamic iterative surgery on UEFI \ufb01rmware to remove a maximal amount of code with no regressive effects on the functionality and performance of higher layers in the stack (OS, applications). DECAF has successfully pruned over 70% of unnecessary, redundant, reachable \ufb01rmware in leading server-grade moth-erboards with no effect on the upper layers, and increased resulting system performance and boot times.",

        "abstract": "Network administrators face a security-critical dilemma. While they want to tightly contain their hosts, they usually have to relax firewall policies to support a large variety of applications. However, liberal policies like this enable data exfiltration by unknown (and untrusted) client applications. An inability to attribute communication accurately and reliably to applications is at the heart of this problem. Firewall policies are restricted to coarse-grained features that are easy to evade and mimic, such as protocols or port numbers. \n \nWe present SENG, a network gateway that enables firewalls to reliably attribute traffic to an application. SENG shields an application in an SGX-tailored LibOS and transparently establishes an attestation-based DTLS channel between the SGX enclave and the central network gateway. Consequently, administrators can perfectly attribute traffic to its originating application, and thereby enforce fine-grained per-application communication policies at a central firewall. Our prototype implementation demonstrates that SENG (i) allows administrators to readily use their favorite firewall to enforce network policies on a certified per-application basis and (ii) prevents local system-level attackers from interfering with the shielded application's communication.",

        "title": "EVMPatch: Timely and Automated Patching of Ethereum Smart Contracts",
        "abstract": "Recent attacks exploiting errors in smart contract code had devastating consequences thereby questioning the benefits of this technology. It is currently highly challenging to fix errors and deploy a patched contract in time. Instant patching is especially important since smart contracts are always online due to the distributed nature of blockchain systems. They also manage considerable amounts of assets, which are at risk and often beyond recovery after an attack. Existing solutions to upgrade smart contracts depend on manual and error-prone processes. This paper presents a framework, called EVMPatch, to instantly and automatically patch faulty smart contracts. EVMPatch features a bytecode rewriting engine for the popular Ethereum blockchain, and transparently/automatically rewrites common off-the-shelf contracts to upgradable contracts. The proof-of-concept implementation of EVMPatch automatically hardens smart contracts that are vulnerable to integer over/underflows and access control errors, but can be easily extended to cover more bug classes. Our extensive evaluation on 14,000 real-world (vulnerable) contracts demonstrate that our approach successfully blocks attack transactions launched on these contracts, while keeping the intended functionality of the contract intact. We perform a study with experienced software developers, showing that EVMPatch is practical, and reduces the time for converting a given Solidity smart contract to an upgradable contract by 97.6 %, while ensuring functional equivalence to the original contract.",

        "title": "PEARL: Plausibly Deniable Flash Translation Layer using WOM coding",
        "abstract": "When adversaries are powerful enough to coerce users to reveal encryption keys, encryption alone becomes insufficient for data protection. Plausible deniability (PD) mechanisms resolve this by enabling users to hide the mere existence of sensitive data, often by providing plausible \"cover texts\" or \"public data volumes\" hosted on the same device. \nUnfortunately, with the increasing prevalence of (NAND) flash as a high-performance cost-effective storage medium, PD becomes even more challenging in the presence of realistic adversaries who can usually access a device at multiple points in time (\"multi-snapshot\"). This is because read/write operations to flash do not result in intuitive corresponding changes to the underlying device state. The problem is further compounded by the fact that this behavior is mostly proprietary. For example, in a majority of commercially-available flash devices, an issued delete or overwrite operation from the upper layers almost certainly won't result in an actual immediate erase of the underlying flash cells. \nTo address these challenges, we designed a new class of write-once memory (WOM) codes to store hidden bits in the same physical locations as other public bits. This is made possible by the inherent nature of NAND flash and the possibility of issuing multiple writes to target cells that have not previous been written to in existing pages. \nWe designed PEARL, a general-purpose Flash Translation Layer (FTL) that allows users to plausibly deniably store hidden data in NAND flash devices. We implemented and evaluated PEARL on a widely used simulator FlashSim (Kim et al. 2019). PEARL performs well on real-world workloads, comparably to non-PD baselines. PEARL is the first system that achieves strong plausible deniability for NAND flash devices, secure against realistic multi-snapshot adversaries.",

        "abstract": "Trusted-execution environments (TEE), like Intel SGX, isolate user-space applications into secure enclaves without trusting the OS. Thus, TEEs reduce the trusted computing base, but add one to two orders of magnitude slow-down. The performance cost stems from a strict memory model, which we call the spatial isolation model, where enclaves cannot share memory regions with each other. In this work, we present Elasticlave---a new TEE memory model that allows enclaves to selectively and temporarily share memory with other enclaves and the OS. Elasticlave eliminates the need for expensive data copy operations, while offering the same level of application-desired security as possible with the spatial model. We prototype Elasticlave design on an RTL-designed cycle-level RISC-V core and observe 1 to 2 orders of magnitude performance improvements over the spatial model implemented with the same processor configuration. Elasticlave has a small TCB. We find that its performance characteristics and hardware area footprint scale well with the number of shared memory regions it is configured to support.",

We investigate to what extent quantitative analysis of operational logs of 2FA systems both supports and challenges recent results from user studies and surveys identifying usability challenges in 2FA systems. Using tens of millions of logs and records kept at two public universities, we quantify the at-scale impact on organizations and their employees during a mandatory 2FA implementation. We show the multiplicative effects of device remembrance, fragmented login services, and authentication timeouts on user burden. We find that user burden does not deviate far from other compliance and risk management time requirements already common to large organizations. We investigate the cause of more than one in twenty 2FA ceremonies being aborted or failing, and the variance in user experience across users. We hope our analysis will empower more organizations to protect themselves with 2FA.",

        "abstract": "Side-channel attacks exploiting (EC)DSA nonce leakage easily lead to full key recovery. Although (EC)DSA implementations have already been hardened against side-channel leakage using the constant-time paradigm, the long-standing cat-and-mouse-game of attacks and patches continues. In particular, current code review is prone to miss less obvious side channels hidden deeply in the call stack. To solve this problem, a systematic study of nonce leakage is necessary. We present a systematic analysis of nonce leakage in cryptographic implementations. In particular, we expand DATA, an open-source side-channel analysis framework, to detect nonce leakage. Our analysis identi\ufb01ed multiple unknown nonce leakage vulnerabilities across all essential computation steps involving nonces. Among others, we uncover inherent problems in Bignumber implementations that break claimed constant-time guarantees of (EC)DSA implementations if secrets are close to a word boundary. We found that lazy re-sizing of Bignumbers in OpenSSL and LibreSSL yields a highly accurate and easily exploitable side channel, which has been acknowledged with two CVEs. Surprisingly, we also found a tiny but expressive leakage in the constant-time scalar multiplication of OpenSSL and BoringSSL. Moreover, in the process of reporting and patching, we identi\ufb01ed newly introduced leakage with the support of our tool, thus preventing another attack-patch cycle. We open-source our tool, together with an intuitive graphical user interface we developed.",

        "abstract": "Secure multi-party machine learning allows several parties to build a model on their pooled data to increase utility while not explicitly sharing data with each other. We show that such multi-party computation can cause leakage of global dataset properties between the parties even when parties obtain only black-box access to the final model. In particular, a ``curious'' party can infer the distribution of sensitive attributes in other parties' data with high accuracy. This raises concerns regarding the confidentiality of properties pertaining to the whole dataset as opposed to individual data records. We show that our attack can leak population-level properties in datasets of different types, including tabular, text, and graph data. To understand and measure the source of leakage, we consider several models of correlation between a sensitive attribute and the rest of the data. Using multiple machine learning models, we show that leakage occurs even if the sensitive attribute is not included in the training data and has a low correlation with other attributes or the target variable.",

        "abstract": "With the growing trend of the Internet of Things, a large number of wireless OBD-II dongles are developed, which can be simply plugged into vehicles to enable remote functions such as sophisticated vehicle control and status monitoring. However, since these dongles are directly connected with in-vehicle networks, they may open a new over-the-air attack surface for vehicles. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive security analysis on all wireless OBD-II dongles available on Amazon in the US in February 2019, which were 77 in total. To systematically perform the analysis, we design and implement an automated tool DONGLESCOPE that dynamically tests these dongles from all possible attack stages on a real automobile. With DONGLESCOPE, we have identified 5 different types of vulnerabilities, with 4 being newly discovered. Our results reveal that each of the 77 dongles exposes at least two types of these vulnerabilities, which indicates a widespread vulnerability exposure among wireless OBD-II dongles on the market today. To demonstrate the severity, we further construct 4 classes of concrete attacks with a variety of practical implications such as privacy leakage, property theft, and even safety threat. We also discuss the root causes and feasible countermeasures, and have made corresponding responsible disclosure.",

        "abstract": "JavaScript (JS) engine vulnerabilities pose significant security threats affecting billions of web browsers. While fuzzing is a prevalent technique for finding such vulnerabilities, there have been few studies that leverage the recent advances in neural network language models (NNLMs). In this paper, we present Montage, the first NNLM-guided fuzzer for finding JS engine vulnerabilities. The key aspect of our technique is to transform a JS abstract syntax tree (AST) into a sequence of AST subtrees that can directly train prevailing NNLMs. We demonstrate that Montage is capable of generating valid JS tests, and show that it outperforms previous studies in terms of finding vulnerabilities. Montage found 37 real-world bugs, including three CVEs, in the latest JS engines, demonstrating its efficacy in finding JS engine bugs.",

        "abstract": "Fingerprint authentication has gained increasing popularity on mobile devices in recent years. However, it is vulnerable to presentation attacks, which include that an attacker spoofs with an arti\ufb01cial replica. Many liveness detection solutions have been proposed to defeat such presentation attacks; however, they all fail to defend against a particular type of presentation attack, namely puppet attack , in which an attacker places an unwilling victim\u2019s \ufb01nger on the \ufb01ngerprint sensor. In this paper, we propose F IN A UTH , an effective and ef\ufb01cient software-only solution, to complement \ufb01ngerprint authentication by defeating both synthetic spoofs and puppet attacks using \ufb01ngertip-touch characteristics. F IN A UTH characterizes intrinsic \ufb01ngertip-touch behaviors including the acceleration and the rotation angle of mobile devices when a legitimate user authenticates. F IN A UTH only utilizes common sensors equipped on mobile devices and does not introduce extra usability burdens on users. To evaluate the effectiveness of F IN A UTH , we carried out experiments on datasets collected from 90 subjects after the IRB approval. The results show that F IN A UTH can achieve the average balanced accuracy of 96.04% with 5 training data points and 99.28% with 100 training data points. Security experiments also demonstrate that F IN A UTH is resilient against possible attacks. In addition, we report the usability analysis results of F IN A UTH , including user authentication delay and overhead.",

        "title": "Systematic Evaluation of Privacy Risks of Machine Learning Models",
        "abstract": "Machine learning models are prone to memorizing sensitive data, making them vulnerable to membership inference attacks in which an adversary aims to guess if an input sample was used to train the model. In this paper, we show that prior work on membership inference attacks may severely underestimate the privacy risks by relying solely on training custom neural network classifiers to perform attacks and focusing only on the aggregate results over data samples, such as the attack accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we first propose to benchmark membership inference privacy risks by improving existing non-neural network based inference attacks and proposing a new inference attack method based on a modification of prediction entropy. We also propose benchmarks for defense mechanisms by accounting for adaptive adversaries with knowledge of the defense and also accounting for the trade-off between model accuracy and privacy risks. Using our benchmark attacks, we demonstrate that existing defense approaches are not as effective as previously reported. \nNext, we introduce a new approach for fine-grained privacy analysis by formulating and deriving a new metric called the privacy risk score. Our privacy risk score metric measures an individual sample's likelihood of being a training member, which allows an adversary to perform membership inference attacks with high confidence. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of the privacy risk score metric and demonstrate that the distribution of the privacy risk score across individual samples is heterogeneous. Finally, we perform an in-depth investigation for understanding why certain samples have high privacy risk scores, including correlations with model sensitivity, generalization error, and feature embeddings. Our work emphasizes the importance of a systematic and rigorous evaluation of privacy risks of machine learning models.",

        "abstract": "Recently, directed grey-box fuzzing (DGF) becomes popular in the \ufb01eld of software testing. Different from coverage-based fuzzing whose goal is to increase code coverage for triggering more bugs, DGF is designed to check whether a piece of potentially buggy code (e.g., string operations) really contains a bug. Ideally, all the inputs generated by DGF should reach the target buggy code until triggering the bug. It is a waste of time when executing with unreachable inputs. Unfortunately, in real situations, large numbers of the generated inputs cannot let a program execute to the target, greatly impacting the ef\ufb01ciency of fuzzing, especially when the buggy code is embedded in the code guarded by various constraints. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based approach to predict the reachability of inputs (i.e., miss the target or not) before executing the target program, helping DGF \ufb01ltering out the unreachable ones to boost the performance of fuzzing. To apply deep learning with DGF, we design a suite of new techniques (e.g., step-forwarding approach , representative data selection ) to solve the problems of unbalanced labeled data and insuf\ufb01cient time in the training process. Further, we implement the proposed approach called FuzzGuard and equip it with the state-of-the-art DGF (e.g., AFLGo). Evaluations on 45 real vulnerabilities show that FuzzGuard boosts the fuzzing ef\ufb01ciency",

        "abstract": "IP anycast is used for services such as DNS and Content Delivery Networks (CDN) to provide the capacity to handle Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. During a DDoS attack service operators redistribute traffic between anycast sites to take advantage of sites with unused or greater capacity. Depending on site traffic and attack size, operators may instead concentrate attackers in a few sites to preserve operation in others. Operators use these actions during attacks, but how to do so has not been described systematically or publicly. This paper describes several methods to use BGP to shift traffic when under DDoS, and shows that a response playbook can provide a menu of responses that are options during an attack. To choose an appropriate response from this playbook, we also describe a new method to estimate true attack size, even though the operator's view during the attack is incomplete. Finally, operator choices are constrained by distributed routing policies, and not all are helpful. We explore how specific anycast deployment can constrain options in this playbook, and are the first to measure how generally applicable they are across multiple anycast networks.",

        "abstract": "Secure software development is a challenging task requiring consideration of many possible threats and mitigations. This paper investigates how and why programmers, despite a baseline of security experience, make security-relevant errors. To do this, we conducted an in-depth analysis of 94 submissions to a secure-programming contest designed to mimic real-world constraints: correctness, performance, and security. In addition to writing secure code, participants were asked to search for vulnerabilities in other teams\u2019 programs; in total, teams submitted 866 exploits against the submissions we considered. Over an intensive six-month period, we used iterative open coding to manually, but systematically, characterize each submitted project and vulnerability (including vulnerabilities we identi\ufb01ed ourselves). We labeled vulnerabilities by type, attacker control allowed, and ease of exploitation, and projects according to security implementation strategy. Several patterns emerged. For example, simple mistakes were least common: only 21% of projects introduced such an error. Conversely, vulnerabilities arising from a misunderstanding of security concepts were signi\ufb01cantly more common, appearing in 78% of projects. Our results have implications for improving secure-programming APIs, API documentation, vulnerability-\ufb01nding tools, and security education.",

        "title": "VoteAgain: A scalable coercion-resistant voting system",
        "abstract": "The strongest threat model for voting systems considers coercion resistance: protection against coercers that force voters to modify their votes, or to abstain. Existing remote voting systems either do not provide this property; require an expensive tallying phase; or burden users with the need to store cryptographic key material and with the responsibility to deceive their coercers. We propose VoteAgain, a scalable voting scheme that relies on the revoting paradigm to provide coercion resistance. VoteAgain uses a novel deterministic ballot padding mechanism to ensure that coercers cannot see whether a vote has been replaced. This mechanism ensures tallies take quasilinear time, making VoteAgain the first revoting scheme that can handle elections with millions of voters. We prove that VoteAgain provides ballot privacy, coercion resistance, and verifiability; and we demonstrate its scalability using a prototype implementation of all cryptographic primitives.",
