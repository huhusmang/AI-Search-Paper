        "title": "On the Security Risks of AutoML",
        "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) represents an emerging machine learning (ML) paradigm that automatically searches for models tailored to given tasks, which greatly simplifies the development of ML systems and propels the trend of ML democratization. Yet, little is known about the potential security risks incurred by NAS, which is concerning given the increasing use of NAS-generated models in critical domains. This work represents a solid initial step towards bridging the gap. Through an extensive empirical study of 10 popular NAS methods, we show that compared with their manually designed counterparts, NAS-generated models tend to suffer greater vulnerability to various malicious attacks (e.g., adversarial evasion, model poisoning, and functionality stealing). Further, with both empirical and analytical evidence, we provide possible explanations for such phenomena: given the prohibitive search space and training cost, most NAS methods favor models that converge fast at early training stages; this preference results in architectural properties associated with attack vulnerability (e.g., high loss smoothness and low gradient variance). Our findings not only reveal the relationships between model characteristics and attack vulnerability but also suggest the inherent connections underlying different attacks. Finally, we discuss potential remedies to mitigate such drawbacks, including increasing cell depth and suppressing skip connects, which lead to several promising research directions.",

        "title": "Increasing Adversarial Uncertainty to Scale Private Similarity Testing",
        "abstract": "Social media and other platforms rely on automated detection of abusive content to help combat disinformation, harassment, and abuse. One common approach is to check user content for similarity against a server-side database of problematic items. However, this method fundamentally endangers user privacy. Instead, we target client-side detection, notifying only the users when such matches occur to warn them against abusive content. Our solution is based on privacy-preserving similarity testing. Existing approaches rely on expensive cryptographic protocols that do not scale well to large databases and may sacrifice the correctness of the matching. To contend with this challenge, we propose and formalize the concept of similarity-based bucketization~(SBB). With SBB, a client reveals a small amount of information to a database-holding server so that it can generate a bucket of potentially similar items. The bucket is small enough for efficient application of privacy-preserving protocols for similarity. To analyze the privacy risk of the revealed information, we introduce a framework for measuring an adversary's confidence in inferring a predicate about the client input correctly. We develop a practical SBB protocol for image content, and evaluate its client privacy guarantee with real-world social media data. We then combine SBB with various similarity protocols, showing that the combination with SBB provides a speedup of at least 29x on large-scale databases compared to that without, while retaining correctness of over 95%.",

        "abstract": "CAPTCHA is an effective mechanism for protecting computers from malicious bots. With the development of deep learning techniques, current mainstream text-based CAPTCHAs have been proven to be insecure. Therefore, a major effort has been directed toward developing image-based CAPTCHAs, and image-based visual reasoning is emerging as a new direction of such development. Recently, Tencent deployed the Visual Turing Test (VTT) CAPTCHA. This appears to have been the first application of a visual reasoning scheme. Subsequently, other CAPTCHA service providers (Geetest, NetEase, Dingxiang, etc.) have proposed their own visual reasoning schemes to defend against bots. It is, therefore, natural to ask a fundamental question: are visual reasoning CAPTCHAs as secure as their designers expect? This paper presents the first attempt to solve visual reasoning CAPTCHAs. We implemented a holistic attack and a modular attack, which achieved overall success rates of 67.3% and 88.0% on VTT CAPTCHA, respectively. The results show that visual reasoning CAPTCHAs are not as secure as anticipated; this latest effort to use novel, hard AI problems for CAPTCHAs has not yet succeeded. Based on the lessons we learned from our attacks, we also offer some guidelines for designing visual CAPTCHAs with better security.",

Ranging from mo-biles to high-end mixed reality headsets, a wide spectrum of interactive systems now employs eye-tracking. However, eye gaze data is a rich source of sensitive information that can reveal an individual\u2019s physiological and psychological traits. Prior approaches to protecting eye-tracking data suffer from two major drawbacks: they are either incompatible with the current eye-tracking ecosystem or provide no formal privacy guarantee. In this paper, we propose Kal e ido , an eye-tracking data processing system that (1) provides a formal privacy guarantee, (2) integrates seamlessly with existing eye-tracking ecosystems, and (3) operates in real-time. Kal e ido acts as an intermediary protection layer in the software stack of eye-tracking systems. We conduct a comprehensive user study and trace-based analysis to evaluate Kal e ido . Our user study shows that the users enjoy a satisfactory level of utility from Kal e ido . Additionally, we present empirical evidence of Kal e ido \u2019s effectiveness in thwarting real-world attacks on eye-tracking data.",

Hence, the security of RDMA architectures is crucial, yet potential security implications of using RDMA communication remain largely unstudied. ReDMArk shows that current security mechanisms of IB-based architectures are insuf\ufb01cient against both in-network attackers and attackers located on end hosts, thus affecting not only secrecy, but also integrity of RDMA applications. We demonstrate multiple vulnerabilities in the design of IB-based architectures and implementations of RDMA-capable network interface cards (RNICs) and exploit those vulnerabilities to enable powerful attacks such as packet injection using impersonation, unauthorized memory access, and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. To thwart the discovered attacks we propose multiple mitigation mechanisms that are deployable in current RDMA networks.",

        "abstract": "Cybercrime is on the rise. Attacks by hackers, organized crime and nation-state adversaries are an economic threat for companies world-wide. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have increasingly become victims of cyber-attacks in recent years. SMEs often lack the awareness and resources to deploy extensive information security measures. However, the health of SMEs is critical for society: For example, in Germany, 38.8% of all employees work in SMEs, which contributed 31.9% of the German annual gross domestic product in 2018. Many guidelines and recommendations encourage companies to invest more into their information security measures. However, there is a lack of understanding of the adoption of security measures in SMEs, their risk perception with regards to cybercrime and their experiences with cyberattacks. To address this gap in research, we performed 5,000 computer-assisted telephone-interviews (CATIs) with representatives of SMEs in Germany. We report on their experiences with cybercrime, management of information security and risk perception. We present and discuss empirical results of the adoption of both technical and organizational security measures and risk awareness in SMEs. We \ufb01nd that many technical security measures and basic awareness have been deployed in the majority of companies. We uncover differences in reporting cybercrime incidences for SMEs based on their industry sector, company size and security awareness. We conclude our work with a discussion of recommendations for future research, industry and policy makers.",

We provide novel insights into this topic through an online study ( n =413) in which we presented participants with up to three data breaches that had exposed their email addresses and other personal information. Overall, 73% of participants were affected by at least one breach, 5.36 breaches on average. Many participants attributed the cause of being affected by a breach to their poor email and security practices; only 14% correctly attributed the cause to external factors such as breached organizations and hackers. Participants were unaware of 74% of displayed breaches and expressed various emotions when learning about them. While some reported intending to take action, most participants believed the breach would not impact them. Our fndings underline the need for user-friendly tools to improve consumers\u2019 resilience against breaches and accountability for breached organizations to provide more proactive post-breach communications and mitigations.",

        "abstract": "We present S MAR T EST , a novel symbolic execution technique for effectively hunting vulnerable transaction sequences in smart contracts. Because smart contracts are stateful programs whose states are altered by transactions, diagnosing and understanding nontrivial vulnerabilities requires generating sequences of transactions that demonstrate the \ufb02aws. However, \ufb01nding such vulnerable transaction sequences is challenging as the number of possible combinations of trans-actions is intractably large. As a result, most existing tools for smart contract analysis use abstractions and merely point out the locations of vulnerabilities, which in turn imposes a steep burden on users of understanding the bugs, or have limited power in generating transaction sequences. In this paper, we aim to overcome this challenge by combining symbolic execution with a language model for vulnerable transaction sequences, so that symbolic execution effectively prioritizes program paths that are likely to reveal vulnerabilities. Experimental results with real-world smart contracts show that S MAR T EST signi\ufb01cantly outperforms existing tools by \ufb01nding more vulnerable transaction sequences including critical zero-day vulnerabilities.",

        "abstract": "A common tool used by security professionals for reverse-engineering binaries found in the wild is the decompiler. A decompiler attempts to reverse compilation, transforming a binary to a higher-level language such as C. High-level languages ease reasoning about programs by providing useful abstractions such as loops, typed variables, and comments, but these abstractions are lost during compilation. Decompilers are able to deterministically reconstruct structural properties of code, but comments, variable names, and custom variable types are technically impossible to recover. In this paper we present DIRTY (DecompIled variable ReTYper), a novel technique for improving the quality of decompiler output that automatically generates meaningful variable names and types. Empirical evaluation on a novel dataset of C code mined from GitHub shows that DIRTY outperforms prior work approaches by a sizable margin, recovering the original names written by developers 66.4% of the time and the original types 75.8% of the time.",

        "abstract": "Despite their in-DRAM Target Row Refresh (TRR) mitiga-tions, some of the most recent DDR4 modules are still vulnerable to many-sided Rowhammer bit \ufb02ips. While these bit \ufb02ips are exploitable from native code, triggering them in the browser from JavaScript faces three nontrivial challenges. First, given the lack of cache \ufb02ushing instructions in JavaScript, existing eviction-based Rowhammer attacks are already slow for the older single-or double-sided variants and thus not always effective. With many-sided Rowhammer, mounting effective attacks is even more challenging, as it requires the eviction of many different aggressor addresses from the CPU caches. Second, the most effective many-sided variants, known as n -sided, require large physically-contiguous memory regions which are not available in JavaScript. Finally, as we show for the \ufb01rst time, eviction-based Rowhammer attacks require proper synchronization to bypass in-DRAM TRR mitigations. Using a number of novel insights, we overcome these challenges to build SMASH (Synchronized MAny-Sided Ham-mering), a technique to succesfully trigger Rowhammer bit \ufb02ips from JavaScript on modern DDR4 systems. To mount effective attacks, SMASH exploits high-level knowledge of cache replacement policies to generate optimal access patterns for eviction-based many-sided Rowhammer. To lift the requirement for large physically-contiguous memory regions, SMASH decomposes n -sided Rowhammer into multiple double-sided pairs, which we can identify using slice coloring. Finally, to bypass the in-DRAM TRR mitigations, SMASH carefully schedules cache hits and misses to successfully trigger synchronized many-sided Rowhammer bit \ufb02ips. We showcase SMASH with an",

        "title": "Mitigating Membership Inference Attacks by Self-Distillation Through a Novel Ensemble Architecture",
        "abstract": "Membership inference attacks are a key measure to evaluate privacy leakage in machine learning (ML) models. These attacks aim to distinguish training members from non-members by exploiting differential behavior of the models on member and non-member inputs. The goal of this work is to train ML models that have high membership privacy while largely preserving their utility; we therefore aim for an empirical membership privacy guarantee as opposed to the provable privacy guarantees provided by techniques like differential privacy, as such techniques are shown to deteriorate model utility. Specifically, we propose a new framework to train privacy-preserving models that induces similar behavior on member and non-member inputs to mitigate membership inference attacks. Our framework, called SELENA, has two major components. The first component and the core of our defense is a novel ensemble architecture for training. This architecture, which we call Split-AI, splits the training data into random subsets, and trains a model on each subset of the data. We use an adaptive inference strategy at test time: our ensemble architecture aggregates the outputs of only those models that did not contain the input sample in their training data. We prove that our Split-AI architecture defends against a large family of membership inference attacks, however, it is susceptible to new adaptive attacks. Therefore, we use a second component in our framework called Self-Distillation to protect against such stronger attacks. The Self-Distillation component (self-)distills the training dataset through our Split-AI ensemble, without using any external public datasets. Through extensive experiments on major benchmark datasets we show that SELENA presents a superior trade-off between membership privacy and utility compared to the state of the art.",

However, conventional time-partitioning mechanisms fail to achieve strong temporal isolation from a security perspective; variations in the executions of partitions can be perceived by others, which enables an algorithmic covert timing-channel between partitions that are completely isolated from each other in the utilization of time. Thus, we present a run-time algorithm that makes partitions oblivious to others\u2019 varying behaviors even when an adversary has full control over their timings. It enables the use of dynamic time-partitioning mechanisms that provide improved responsiveness, while guaranteeing the algorithmic-level non-interference that static approaches would achieve.

However, existing ad and tracker blockers fall short because of their reliance on trivially susceptible advertising and tracking content. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the state-of-the-art machine learning based ad and tracker blockers, such as AdGraph, are susceptible to adversarial evasions deployed in real-world. Second, we introduce WebGraph, the first graph-based machine learning blocker that detects ads and trackers based on their action rather than their content. By building features around the actions that are fundamental to advertising and tracking - storing an identifier in the browser, or sharing an identifier with another tracker - WebGraph performs nearly as well as prior approaches, but is significantly more robust to adversarial evasions. In particular, we show that WebGraph achieves comparable accuracy to AdGraph, while significantly decreasing the success rate of an adversary from near-perfect under AdGraph to around 8% under WebGraph. Finally, we show that WebGraph remains robust to a more sophisticated adversary that uses evasion techniques beyond those currently deployed on the web.",

        "abstract": "Re\ufb02ective ampli\ufb01cation attacks are a powerful tool in the arsenal of a DDoS attacker, but to date have almost exclusively targeted UDP-based protocols. In this paper, we demonstrate that non-trivial TCP-based ampli\ufb01cation is possible and can be orders of magnitude more effective than well-known UDP-based ampli\ufb01cation. By taking advantage of TCP-non-compliance in network middleboxes, we show that attackers can induce middleboxes to respond and amplify network traf-\ufb01c. With the novel application of a recent genetic algorithm, we discover and maximize the ef\ufb01cacy of new TCP-based re\ufb02ective ampli\ufb01cation attacks, and present several packet sequences that cause network middleboxes to respond with substantially more packets than we send. We scanned the entire IPv4 Internet to measure how many IP addresses permit re\ufb02ected ampli\ufb01cation. We \ufb01nd hundreds of thousands of IP addresses that offer ampli\ufb01cation factors greater than 100 \u00d7 . Through our Internet-wide measurements, we explore several open questions regarding DoS attacks, including the root cause of so-called \u201cmega ampli\ufb01ers\u201d. We also report on network phenomena that causes some of the TCP-based attacks to be so effective as to technically have in\ufb01nite ampli\ufb01cation factor (after the attacker sends a constant number of bytes, the re\ufb02ector generates traf\ufb01c inde\ufb01nitely). We have made our code publicly available.",

        "abstract": "Email breaches are commonplace, and they expose a wealth of personal, business, and political data whose release may have devastating consequences. Such damage is compounded by email\u2019s strong attributability: today, any attacker who gains access to your email can easily prove to others that the stolen messages are authentic, a property arising from a necessary anti-spam/anti-spoo\ufb01ng protocol called DKIM. This greatly increases attackers\u2019 capacity to do harm by selling the stolen information to third parties, blackmail, or publicly releasing intimate or sensitive messages \u2014 all with built-in cryptographic proof of authenticity. This paper introduces non-attributable email , which guarantees that a wide class of adversaries are unable to convince discerning third parties of the authenticity of stolen emails. We formally de\ufb01ne non-attributability, and present two system proposals \u2014 KeyForge and Time-Forge \u2014 that provably achieve non-attributability while maintaining the important spam/spoo\ufb01ng protections currently provided by DKIM. Finally, we implement both and evaluate their speed and bandwidth performance overhead. We demonstrate the practicality of KeyForge, which achieves reasonable veri\ufb01cation overhead while signing faster and requiring 42% less bandwidth per message than DKIM\u2019s RSA-2048.",

        "title": "ReDoSHunter: A Combined Static and Dynamic Approach for Regular Expression DoS Detection",
        "abstract": "Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a class of algorithmic complexity attacks using the regular expressions (regexes) that cause the typical backtracking-based matching algorithms to run super-linear time. Due to the wide adoption of regexes in computation, ReDoS poses a pervasive and serious security threat. Early detection of ReDoS-vulnerable regexes in software is thus vital. Existing detection approaches mainly fall into two categories: static and dynamic analysis. However, they all suffer from either poor precision or poor recall in the detection of vulnerable regexes. The problem of accurately detecting vulnerable regexes at high precision and high recall remains unsolved. Furthermore, we observed that many ReDoS-vulnerable regex contain more than one vulnerability in reality. Another problem with existing approaches is that they are incapable of detecting multiple vulnerabilities in one regex. To address these two problems, we propose ReDoSHunter, a ReDoS-vulnerable regex detection framework that can effectively pinpoint the multiple vulnerabilities in a vulnerable regex, and generate examples of attack-triggering strings. Re-DoSHunter is driven by \ufb01ve vulnerability patterns derived from massive vulnerable regexes. Besides pinpointing vulnerabilities, ReDoSHunter can assess the degree (i.e., exponential or polynomial) of the vulnerabilities detected. Our experiment results show that ReDoSHunter achieves 100% precision and 100% recall in the detection of ReDoS-vulnerable regexes in three large-scale datasets with 37,651 regexes. It signi\ufb01cantly outperforms seven state-of-the-art techniques.",

        "title": "Phishpedia: A Hybrid Deep Learning Based Approach to Visually Identify Phishing Webpages",
        "abstract": "Recent years have seen the development of phishing detection and identification approaches to defend against phishing attacks. Phishing detection solutions often report binary results, i.e., phishing or not, without any explanation. In contrast, phishing identification approaches identify phishing webpages by visually comparing webpages with predefined legitimate references and report phishing along with its target brand, thereby having explainable results. However, there are technical challenges in visual analyses that limit existing solutions from being effective (with high accuracy) and efficient (with low runtime overhead), to be put to practical use. In this work, we design a hybrid deep learning system, Phishpedia, to address two prominent technical challenges in phishing identification, i.e., (i) accurate recognition of identity logos on webpage screenshots, and (ii) matching logo variants of the same brand. Phishpedia achieves both high accuracy and low runtime overhead. And very importantly, different from common approaches, Phishpedia does not require training on any phishing samples. We carry out extensive experiments using real phishing data; the results demonstrate that Phishpedia significantly outperforms baseline identification approaches (EMD, PhishZoo, and LogoSENSE) in accurately and efficiently identifying phishing pages. We also deployed Phishpedia with CertStream service and discovered 1,704 new real phishing websites within 30 days, significantly more than other solutions; moreover, 1,133 of them are not reported by any engines in VirusTotal.",

        "abstract": "Children use technology from a very young age, and often have to authenticate. The goal of this study is to explore children\u2019s practices, perceptions, and knowledge regarding passwords. Given the limited work to date and the fact that the world\u2019s cyber posture and culture will be dependent on today\u2019s youth, it is imperative to conduct cybersecurity research with children. We conducted the first large-scale survey of 1,505 3 rd to 12 th graders from schools across the United States. Not surprisingly, children have fewer passwords than adults. We found that children have complicated relationships with passwords: on one hand, their perceptions about passwords and statements about password behavior are appropriate; on the other hand, however, they simultaneously do not tend to make strong passwords, and practice bad password behavior such as sharing passwords with friends. We conclude with a call for cybersecurity education to bridge the gap between students\u2019 password knowledge with their password behavior, while continuing to provide and promote security understandings.",

        "abstract": "Ethereum prospered the inception of a plethora of smart contract applications, ranging from gambling games to decentralized finance. However, Ethereum is also considered a highly adversarial environment, where vulnerable smart contracts will eventually be exploited. Recently, Ethereum's pool of pending transaction has become a far more aggressive environment. In the hope of making some profit, attackers continuously monitor the transaction pool and try to frontrun their victims' transactions by either displacing or suppressing them, or strategically inserting their transactions. This paper aims to shed some light into what is known as a dark forest and uncover these predators' actions. We present a methodology to efficiently measure the three types of frontrunning: displacement, insertion, and suppression. We perform a large-scale analysis on more than 11M blocks and identify almost 200K attacks with an accumulated profit of 18.41M USD for the attackers, providing evidence that frontrunning is both, lucrative and a prevalent issue.",

        "abstract": "Performance degradation techniques are an important complement to side-channel attacks. In this work, we propose HyperDegrade -- a combination of previous approaches and the use of simultaneous multithreading (SMT) architectures. In addition to the new technique, we investigate the root causes of performance degradation using cache eviction, discovering a previously unknown slowdown origin. The slowdown produced is significantly higher than previous approaches, which translates into an increased time granularity for Flush+Reload attacks. We evaluate HyperDegrade on different Intel microarchitectures, yielding significant slowdowns that achieve, in select microbenchmark cases, three orders of magnitude improvement over state-of-the-art. To evaluate the efficacy of performance degradation in side-channel amplification, we propose and evaluate leakage assessment metrics. The results evidence that HyperDegrade increases time granularity without a meaningful impact on trace quality. Additionally, we designed a fair experiment that compares three performance degradation strategies when coupled with Flush+Reload from an attacker perspective. We developed an attack on an unexploited vulnerability in OpenSSL in which HyperDegrade excels -- reducing by three times the number of required Flush+Reload traces to succeed. Regarding cryptography contributions, we revisit the recently proposed Raccoon attack on TLS-DH key exchanges, demonstrating its application to other protocols. Using HyperDegrade, we developed an end-to-end attack that shows how a Raccoon-like attack can succeed with real data, filling a missing gap from previous research.",

        "abstract": "Hardware-based fault injection attacks such as voltage and clock glitching have been thoroughly studied on embedded devices. Typical targets for such attacks include smartcards and low-power microcontrollers used in IoT devices. This paper presents the first hardware-based voltage glitching attack against a fully-fledged Intel CPU. The transition to complex CPUs is not trivial due to several factors, including: a complex operating system, large power consumption, multi-threading, and high clock speeds. To this end, we have built VoltPillager, a low-cost tool for injecting messages on the Serial Voltage Identification bus between the CPU and the voltage regulator on the motherboard. This allows us to precisely control the CPU core voltage. We leverage this powerful tool to mount fault-injection attacks that breach confidentiality and integrity of Intel SGX enclaves. We present proof-of-concept key-recovery attacks against cryptographic algorithms running inside SGX. We demonstrate that VoltPillager attacks are more powerful than recent software-only undervolting attacks against SGX (CVE-2019-11157) because they work on fully patched systems with all countermeasures against software undervolting enabled. Additionally, we are able to fault securitycritical operations by delaying memory writes. Mitigation of VoltPillager is not straightforward and may require a rethink of the SGX adversarial model where a cloud provider is untrusted and has physical access to the hardware.",

        "abstract": "Credential stuffing attacks use stolen passwords to log into victim accounts. To defend against these attacks, recently deployed compromised credential checking (C3) services provide APIs that help users and companies check whether a username, password pair is exposed. These services however only check if the exact password is leaked, and therefore do not mitigate credential tweaking attacks - attempts to compromise a user account with variants of a user's leaked passwords. Recent work has shown credential tweaking attacks can compromise accounts quite effectively even when the credential stuffing countermeasures are in place. We initiate work on C3 services that protect users from credential tweaking attacks. The core underlying challenge is how to identify passwords that are similar to their leaked passwords while preserving honest clients' privacy and also preventing malicious clients from extracting breach data from the service. We formalize the problem and explore ways to measure password similarity that balance efficacy, performance, and security. Based on this study, we design\"Might I Get Pwned\"(MIGP), a new kind of breach alerting service. Our simulations show that MIGP reduces the efficacy of state-of-the-art 1000-guess credential tweaking attacks by 94%. MIGP preserves user privacy and limits potential exposure of sensitive breach entries. We show that the protocol is fast, with response time close to existing C3 services. We worked with Cloudflare to deploy MIGP in practice.",

        "abstract": "Smart home technology may expose adopters to increased risk to network security, information privacy, and physical safety. However, users may lack understanding of the privacy and security implications. Additionally, manufacturers often fail to provide transparency and configuration options, and few government-provided guidelines have yet to be widely adopted. This results in little meaningful mitigation action to protect users\u2019 security and privacy. But how can this situation be improved and by whom? It is currently unclear where perceived responsibility for smart home privacy and security lies. To address this gap, we conducted an in-depth interview study of 40 smart home adopters to explore where they assign responsibility and how their perceptions of responsibility relate to their concerns and mitigations. Results reveal that participants\u2019 perceptions of responsibility reflect an interdependent relationship between consumers, manufacturers, and third parties such as the government. However, perceived breakdowns and gaps in the relationship result in users being concerned about their security and privacy. Based on our results, we suggest ways in which these actors can address gaps and better support each other.",

        "title": "Expected Exploitability: Predicting the Development of Functional Vulnerability Exploits",
        "abstract": "Assessing the exploitability of software vulnerabilities at the time of disclosure is difficult and error-prone, as features extracted via technical analysis by existing metrics are poor predictors for exploit development. Moreover, exploitability assessments suffer from a class bias because\"not exploitable\"labels could be inaccurate. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new metric, called Expected Exploitability (EE), which reflects, over time, the likelihood that functional exploits will be developed. Key to our solution is a time-varying view of exploitability, a departure from existing metrics. This allows us to learn EE using data-driven techniques from artifacts published after disclosure, such as technical write-ups and proof-of-concept exploits, for which we design novel feature sets. This view also allows us to investigate the effect of the label biases on the classifiers. We characterize the noise-generating process for exploit prediction, showing that our problem is subject to the most challenging type of label noise, and propose techniques to learn EE in the presence of noise. On a dataset of 103,137 vulnerabilities, we show that EE increases precision from 49% to 86% over existing metrics, including two state-of-the-art exploit classifiers, while its precision substantially improves over time. We also highlight the practical utility of EE for predicting imminent exploits and prioritizing critical vulnerabilities. We develop EE into an online platform which is publicly available at https://exploitability.app/.",

        "abstract": "The proliferation of automated face recognition in the commercial and government sectors has caused significant privacy concerns for individuals. One approach to address these privacy concerns is to employ evasion attacks against the metric embedding networks powering face recognition systems: Face obfuscation systems generate imperceptibly perturbed images that cause face recognition systems to misidentify the user. Perturbed faces are generated on metric embedding networks, which are known to be unfair in the context of face recognition. A question of demographic fairness naturally follows: are there demographic disparities in face obfuscation system performance? We answer this question with an analytical and empirical exploration of recent face obfuscation systems. Metric embedding networks are found to be demographically aware: face embeddings are clustered by demographic. We show how this clustering behavior leads to reduced face obfuscation utility for faces in minority groups. An intuitive analytical model yields insight into these phenomena.",

        "abstract": "Logic locking is a promising solution against emerging hardware security threats, which entails protecting a Boolean circuit using a \u201ckeying\u201d mechanism. The latest and hitherto unbroken logic-locking techniques are based on the \u201ccorrupt-and-correct (CAC)\u201d principle, offering provable security against input-output query attacks. However, it remains unclear whether these techniques are susceptible to structural attacks. This paper exploits the properties of integrated circuit (IC) design tools, also termed electronic design automation (EDA) tools, to undermine the security of the CAC techniques. Our proposed attack can break all the CAC techniques, including the unbroken CACrem technique that 40+ hackers taking part in a competition for more than three months could not break. Our attack can break circuits processed with any EDA tools, which is alarming because, until now, none of the EDA tools can render a secure locking solution: logic locking cannot make use of the existing EDA tools. We also provide a security property to ensure resilience against structural attacks. The commonly-used circuits can satisfy this property but only in a few cases where they cannot even defeat brute-force; thus, questions arise on the use of these circuits as benchmarks to evaluate logic locking and other security techniques.",

        "title": "An Investigation of the Android Kernel Patch Ecosystem",
        "abstract": "open-source projects are often reused in commercial software. Android, a popular mobile operating system, is a great example that has fostered an ecosystem of open-source kernels. However, due to the largely decentralized and fragmented nature, patch propagation from the upstream through multiple layers to end devices can be severely delayed. In this paper, we undertake a thorough investigation of the patch propagation behaviors in the entire Android kernel ecosystem. By analyzing the CVEs and patches available since the inception of the Android security bulletin, as well as open-source upstream kernels ( e.g., Linux and AOSP) and hundreds of mostly binary OEM kernels ( e.g., by Samsung), we \ufb01nd that the delays of patches are largely due to the current patching practices and the lack of knowledge about which upstream commits being security-critical. Unfortunately, we \ufb01nd that the gap between the \ufb01rst publicly available patch and its \ufb01nal application on end devices is often months and even years, leaving a large attack window for experienced hackers to exploit the unpatched vulnerabilities.",

        "title": "Automatic Firmware Emulation through Invalidity-guided Knowledge Inference (Extended Version)",
        "abstract": "Emulating firmware for microcontrollers is challenging due to the tight coupling between the hardware and firmware. This has greatly impeded the application of dynamic analysis tools to firmware analysis. The state-of-the-art work automatically models unknown peripherals by observing their access patterns, and then leverages heuristics to calculate the appropriate responses when unknown peripheral registers are accessed. However, we empirically found that this approach and the corresponding heuristics are frequently insufficient to emulate firmware. In this work, we propose a new approach called uEmu to emulate firmware with unknown peripherals. Unlike existing work that attempts to build a general model for each peripheral, our approach learns how to correctly emulate firmware execution at individual peripheral access points. It takes the image as input and symbolically executes it by representing unknown peripheral registers as symbols. During symbolic execution, it infers the rules to respond to unknown peripheral accesses. These rules are stored in a knowledge base, which is referred to during the dynamic firmware analysis. uEmu achieved a passing rate of 95% in a set of unit tests for peripheral drivers without any manual assistance. We also evaluated uEmu with real-world firmware samples and new bugs were discovered.",

        "title": "MBA-Blast: Unveiling and Simplifying Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic Obfuscation",
        "abstract": "Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic (MBA) obfuscation is a method to perform a semantics-preserving transformation from a simple expression to a representation that is hard to understand and analyze. More speci\ufb01cally, this obfuscation technique consists of the mixture usage of arithmetic operations (e.g., ADD and IMUL) and Boolean operations (e.g., AND, OR, and NOT). Binary code with MBA obfuscation can effectively hide the secret data/algorithm from both static and dynamic reverse engineering, including advanced analyses utilizing SMT solvers. Unfortunately, deobfuscation research against MBA is still in its infancy: state-of-the-art solutions such as pattern matching, bit-blasting, and program synthesis either suffer from severe performance penalties, are designed for speci\ufb01c MBA patterns, or generate too many false simpli\ufb01ca-tion results in practice. In this paper, we \ufb01rst demystify the underlying mechanism of MBA obfuscation. Our in-depth study reveals a hidden two-way feature regarding MBA transformation between 1-bit and n-bit variables. We exploit this feature and propose a viable solution to ef\ufb01ciently deobfuscate code with MBA obfuscation. Our key insight is that MBA transformations behave in the same way on 1-bit and n-bit variables. We provide a mathematical proof to guarantee the correctness of this \ufb01nding. We further develop a novel technique to simplify MBA expressions to a normal simple form by arithmetic reduction in 1-bit space. We have implemented this idea as an open-source prototype, named MBA-Blast , and evaluated it on a comprehensive dataset with about 10 , 000 MBA expressions. We also tested our method in real-world, binary code deobfuscation scenarios, which demonstrate that MBA-Blast can assist human analysts to harness the full strength of SMT solvers. Compared with existing work, MBA-Blast is the most generic and ef\ufb01cient MBA deobfuscation technique; it has a solid theoretical underpinning, as well as, the highest success rate with negligible overhead.",

        "abstract": "Many recent DDoS attacks rely on amplification, where an attacker induces public servers to generate a large volume of network traffic to a victim. In this paper, we argue for a low-footprint Internet health monitoring service that can systematically and continuously quantify this risk to inform mitigation efforts. Unfortunately, the problem is challenging because amplification is a complex function of query (header) values and server instances. As such, existing techniques that enumerate the total number of servers or focus on a specific amplification-inducing query are fundamentally imprecise. In designing AmpMap, we leverage key structural insights to develop an efficient approach that searches across the space of protocol headers and servers. Using AmpMap, we scanned thousands of servers for 6 UDP-based protocols. We find that relying on prior recommendations to block or rate-limit specific queries still leaves open substantial residual risk as they miss many other amplification-inducing query patterns. We also observe significant variability across servers and protocols, and thus prior approaches that rely on server census can substantially misestimate amplification risk.",

        "abstract": "Linux container-based microservices have emerged as an attractive alternative to virtualization as they reduce application footprints and facilitate more ef\ufb01cient resource utilization. Their popularity has also led to increased scrutiny of the underlying security properties and attack surface of container technology. Provenance-based analysis techniques have been proposed as an effective means toward comprehensive and high-assurance security control as they provide \ufb01ne-grained mechanisms to track data \ufb02ows across the system and detect unwanted or unexpected changes to data objects. However, existing provenance tracking techniques are limited in their ability to build sound and clear provenance in container network environments due to complexities introduced by namespace virtualization . We describe a namespace-and container-aware provenance tracking solution, called CLARION, that addresses the unique soundness and clarity challenges introduced by traditional provenance tracking solutions. Speci\ufb01cally, we \ufb01rst describe fragmentation and ambiguities introduced in provenance analysis tools by each of the Linux namespaces and propose solutions to address analysis soundness. Then we discuss the design of specialized semantics-summarization techniques that improve the clarity of provenance analysis. We have developed a prototype implementation of CLARION and evaluate its performance against a spectrum of container-speci\ufb01c attacks. The results demonstrate the utility of our sys-tem and how it outperforms the state-of-the-art provenance tracking systems by providing an accurate and concise view of data provenance in container environments.",

        "abstract": "Trigger-Action Platforms (TAPs) seamlessly connect a wide variety of otherwise unconnected devices and services, ranging from IoT devices to cloud services and social networks. TAPs raise critical security and privacy concerns because a TAP is effectively a \u201cperson-in-the-middle\u201d between trigger and action services. Third-party code, routinely deployed as \u201capps\u201d on TAPs, further exacerbates these concerns. This paper focuses on JavaScript-driven TAPs. We show that the popular IFTTT and Zapier platforms and an open-source alternative Node-RED are susceptible to attacks ranging from ex\ufb01ltrating data from unsuspecting users to taking over the entire platform. We report on the changes by the platforms in response to our \ufb01ndings and present an empirical study to assess the implications for Node-RED. Motivated by the need for a secure yet \ufb02exible way to integrate third-party JavaScript apps, we propose SandTrap, a novel JavaScript monitor that securely combines the Node.js vm module with fully structural proxy-based two-sided membranes to enforce \ufb01ne-grained access control policies. To aid developers, SandTrap includes a policy generation mechanism. We instantiate SandTrap to IFTTT, Zapier, and Node-RED and illustrate on a set of benchmarks how SandTrap enforces a variety of policies while incurring a tolerable runtime overhead.",

        "abstract": "End-to-end encryption (E2EE) by messaging platforms en-able people to securely and privately communicate with one another. Its widespread adoption however raised concerns that illegal content might now be shared undetected. Following the global pushback against key escrow systems, client-side scanning based on perceptual hashing has been recently proposed by tech companies, governments and researchers to detect illegal content in E2EE communications. We here propose the \ufb01rst framework to evaluate the robustness of perceptual hashing-based client-side scanning to detection avoidance attacks and show current systems to not be robust. More speci\ufb01cally, we propose three adversarial attacks\u2013a general black-box attack and two white-box attacks for discrete cosine transform-based algorithms\u2013against perceptual hashing algorithms. In a large-scale evaluation, we show perceptual hashing-based client-side scanning mechanisms to be highly vulnerable to detection avoidance attacks in a black-box setting, with more than 99.9% of images successfully attacked while preserving the content of the image. We furthermore show our attack to generate diverse perturbations, strongly suggesting that straightforward mitigation strategies would be ineffective. Finally, we show that the larger thresholds necessary to make the attack harder would probably require more than one billion images to be \ufb02agged and decrypted daily, raising strong privacy concerns. Taken together, our results shed serious doubts on the robustness of perceptual hashing-based client-side scanning mechanisms currently proposed by governments, organizations, and researchers around the world. 1",

        "abstract": "With their growing popularity, Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices have become attractive targets for attack. Like most modern software systems, IoT device \ufb01rmware depends on external third-party libraries extensively, increasing the attack surface of IoT devices. Furthermore, we \ufb01nd that the risk is compounded by inconsistent library management practices and delays in applying security updates\u2014sometimes hundreds of days behind the public availability of critical patches\u2014by device vendors. Worse yet, because these dependencies are \u201cbaked into\u201d the vendor-controlled \ufb01rmware, even security-conscious users are unable to take matters into their own hands when it comes to good security hygiene. We present Capture , a novel architecture for deploying IoT device \ufb01rmware that addresses this problem by allowing devices on a local network to leverage a centralized hub with third-party libraries that are managed and kept up-to-date by a single trusted entity. An IoT device supporting Capture comprises of two components: Capture-enabled \ufb01rmware on the device and a remote driver that uses third-party libraries on the Capture hub in the local network. To ensure isolation, we introduce a novel Virtual Device Entity (VDE) interface that facilitates access control between mutually-distrustful devices that reside on the same hub. Our evaluation on a prototype implementation of Capture, along with 9 devices and 3 automation applets ported to our framework, shows that our approach incurs low overhead in most cases ( < 15% increased latency, < 10% additional resources). We show that a single Capture Hub with modest hardware can support hundreds of devices, keeping their shared libraries up-to-date.",

        "title": "ALPACA: Application Layer Protocol Confusion - Analyzing and Mitigating Cracks in TLS Authentication",
        "abstract": "TLS is widely used to add confidentiality, authenticity and integrity to application layer protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and FTP. However, TLS does not bind a TCP connection to the intended application layer protocol. This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to redirect TLS traffic to a different TLS service endpoint on another IP address and/or port. For example, if subdomains share a wildcard certificate, an attacker can redirect traffic from one subdomain to another, resulting in a valid TLS session. This breaks the authentication of TLS and cross-protocol attacks may be possible where the behavior of one service may compromise the security of the other at the application layer. In this paper, we investigate cross-protocol attacks on TLS in general and conduct a systematic case study on web servers, redirecting HTTPS requests from a victim\u2019s web browser to SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and FTP servers. We show that in realistic scenarios, the attacker can extract session cookies and other private user data or execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the vulnerable web server, therefore bypassing TLS and web application security. We evaluate the real-world attack surface of web browsers and widely-deployed email and FTP servers in lab experiments and with internet-wide scans. We find that 1.4M web servers are generally vulnerable to cross-protocol attacks, i.e., TLS application data confusion is possible. Of these, 114k web servers can be attacked using an exploitable application server. Finally, we discuss the effectiveness of TLS extensions such as Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) and Server Name Indiciation (SNI) in mitigating these and other cross-protocol attacks.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the first empirical study of ground-truth data from a major underground shop selling stolen credit and debit cards. To date, there is little quantitative knowledge about how this segment of the underground economy operates, despite it causing fraud losses estimated at billions of dollars a year. Our analysis of four years of leaked transactional data allows us to characterize this shop\u2019s business model, sellers, customers, and finances. The shop earned close to $104 M in gross revenue, and listed over 19 M unique card numbers for sale. Around 97% of the inventory was stolen magnetic stripe data, commonly used to produce counterfeit cards for in-person payments. Perhaps surprisingly, customers purchased only 40% of this inventory. In contrast, the shop sold 83% of its card-not-present inventory, used for online fraud, which appeared to be in short supply. Demand and pricing were not uniform, as buyers appeared to perceive some banks as having weaker countermeasures against fraud. Even multiple years into the U.S. EMV chip deployment, the supply of stolen magnetic stripe data continued to increase sharply. In particular, we identified a continuing supply of newly issued cards not equipped with EMV chips, especially among prepaid cards. Our findings suggest that improvements to EMV chip deployment in the U.S., combined with a limited supply of stolen card-not-present data, could be avenues to decreasing the revenue and profitability of this shop.",

        "title": "CADE: Detecting and Explaining Concept Drift Samples for Security Applications",
        "abstract": "Concept drift poses a critical challenge to deploy machine learning models to solve practical security problems. Due to the dynamic behavior changes of attackers (and/or the benign counterparts), the testing data distribution is often shifting from the original training data over time, causing major failures to the deployed model. To combat concept drift, we present a novel system CADE aiming to 1) detect drifting samples that deviate from existing classes, and 2) provide explanations to reason the detected drift. Unlike traditional approaches (that require a large number of new labels to determine concept drift statistically), we aim to identify individual drifting samples as they arrive. Recognizing the challenges introduced by the high-dimensional outlier space, we propose to map the data samples into a low-dimensional space and automatically learn a distance function to measure the dissimilarity between samples. Using contrastive learning, we can take full advantage of existing labels in the training dataset to learn how to compare and contrast pairs of samples. To reason the meaning of the detected drift, we develop a distance-based explanation method. We show that explaining \u201cdistance\u201d is much more effective than traditional methods that focus on explaining a \u201cdecision boundary\u201d in this problem context. We evaluate CADE with two case studies: Android malware classification and network intrusion detection. We further work with a security company to test CADE on its malware database. Our results show that CADE can effectively detect drifting samples and provide semantically meaningful explanations.",

        "abstract": "The \"eternal war in cache\" has reached browsers, with multiple cache-based side-channel attacks and countermeasures being suggested. A common approach for countermeasures is to disable or restrict JavaScript features deemed essential for carrying out attacks. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, in this work we seek to identify those JavaScript features which are essential for carrying out a cache-based attack. We develop a sequence of attacks with progressively decreasing dependency on JavaScript features, culminating in the first browser-based side-channel attack which is constructed entirely from Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and HTML, and works even when script execution is completely blocked. We then show that avoiding JavaScript features makes our techniques architecturally agnostic, resulting in microarchitectural website fingerprinting attacks that work across hardware platforms including Intel Core, AMD Ryzen, Samsung Exynos, and Apple M1 architectures. As a final contribution, we evaluate our techniques in hardened browser environments including the Tor browser, Deter-Fox (Cao el al., CCS 2017), and Chrome Zero (Schwartz et al., NDSS 2018). We confirm that none of these approaches completely defend against our attacks. We further argue that the protections of Chrome Zero need to be more comprehensively applied, and that the performance and user experience of Chrome Zero will be severely degraded if this approach is taken.",

        "abstract": "Privacy dashboards and transparency tools help users review and manage the data collected about them online. Since 2016, Google has offered such a tool, My Activity, which allows users to review and delete their activity data from Google services. We conducted an online survey with $n = 153$ participants to understand if Google's My Activity, as an example of a privacy transparency tool, increases or decreases end-users' concerns and benefits regarding data collection. While most participants were aware of Google's data collection, the volume and detail was surprising, but after exposure to My Activity, participants were significantly more likely to be both less concerned about data collection and to view data collection more beneficially. Only $25\\,\\%$ indicated that they would change any settings in the My Activity service or change any behaviors. This suggests that privacy transparency tools are quite beneficial for online services as they garner trust with their users and improve their perceptions without necessarily changing users' behaviors. At the same time, though, it remains unclear if such transparency tools actually improve end user privacy by sufficiently assisting or motivating users to change or review data collection settings.",

        "abstract": "As large messaging providers increasingly adopt end-to-end encryption, private communication is readily available to more users than ever before. However, misunderstandings of end-to-end encryption\u2019s bene\ufb01ts and shortcomings limit people\u2019s ability to make informed choices about how and when to use these services. This paper explores the potential of using short educational messages, built into messaging work\ufb02ows, to improve users\u2019 functional mental models of secure communication. A preliminary survey study (n = 461) \ufb01nds that such messages, when used in isolation, can e \ufb00 ectively improve understanding of several key concepts. We then conduct a longitudinal study (n = 61) to test these messages in a more realistic environment: embedded into a secure messaging app. In this second study, we do not \ufb01nd statistically signi\ufb01cant evidence of improvement in mental models; however, qualitative evidence from participant interviews suggests that if made more salient, such messages could have potential to improve users\u2019 understanding.",

        "title": "Poisoning Attacks to Local Differential Privacy Protocols for Key-Value Data",
        "abstract": "Local Differential Privacy (LDP) protocols enable an untrusted server to perform privacy-preserving, federated data analytics. Various LDP protocols have been developed for different types of data such as categorical data, numerical data, and key-value data. Due to their distributed settings, LDP protocols are fundamentally vulnerable to poisoning attacks, in which fake users manipulate the server's analytics results via sending carefully crafted data to the server. However, existing poisoning attacks focused on LDP protocols for simple data types such as categorical and numerical data, leaving the security of LDP protocols for more advanced data types such as key-value data unexplored. In this work, we aim to bridge the gap by introducing novel poisoning attacks to LDP protocols for key-value data. In such a LDP protocol, a server aims to simultaneously estimate the frequency and mean value of each key among some users, each of whom possesses a set of key-value pairs. Our poisoning attacks aim to simultaneously maximize the frequencies and mean values of some attacker-chosen target keys via sending carefully crafted data from some fake users to the sever. Specifically, since our attacks have two objectives, we formulate them as a two-objective optimization problem. Moreover, we propose a method to approximately solve the two-objective optimization problem, from which we obtain the optimal crafted data the fake users should send to the server. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks to three LDP protocols for key-value data both theoretically and empirically. We also explore two defenses against our attacks, which are effective in some scenarios but have limited effectiveness in other scenarios. Our results highlight the needs for new defenses against our poisoning attacks.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an in-kernel, hardware-based control-flow integrity (CFI) protection, called PAL, that utilizes ARM's Pointer Authentication (PA). It provides three important benefits over commercial, state-of-the-art PA-based CFIs like iOS's: 1) enhancing CFI precision via automated refinement techniques, 2) addressing hindsight problems of PA for in kernel uses such as preemptive hijacking and brute-forcing attacks, and 3) assuring the algorithmic or implementation correctness via post validation. PAL achieves these goals in an OS-agnostic manner, so could be applied to commodity OSes like Linux and FreeBSD. The precision of the CFI protection can be adjusted for better performance or improved for better security with minimal engineering efforts if a user opts in to. Our evaluation shows that PAL incurs negligible performance overhead: e.g.,<1% overhead for Apache benchmark and 3~5% overhead for Linux perf benchmark on the latest Mac mini (M1). Our post-validation approach helps us ensure the security invariant required for the safe uses of PA inside the kernel, which also reveals new attack vectors on the iOS kernel. PAL as well as the CFI-protected kernels will be open sourced.",

        "abstract": "Android applications have a long history of being vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks due to insecure custom TLS certi\ufb01cate validation implementations. To resolve this, Google deployed the Network Security Con\ufb01guration (NSC), a con\ufb01guration-based approach to increase custom certi\ufb01-cate validation logic security, and implemented safeguards in Google Play to block insecure applications. In this paper, we perform a large-scale in-depth investigation of the effectiveness of these countermeasures: First, we investigate the security of 99,212 NSC settings \ufb01les in 1,335,322 Google Play apps using static code and manual analysis techniques. We \ufb01nd that 88.87% of the apps using custom NSC settings downgrade security compared to the default settings, and only 0.67% implement certi\ufb01cate pinning. Second, we penetrate Google Play\u2019s protection mechanisms by trying to publish apps that are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. In contrast to of\ufb01cial announcements by Google, we found that Play does not effectively block vulnerable apps. Finally, we performed a static code analysis study of 15,000 apps and \ufb01nd that 5,511 recently published apps still contain vulnerable certi\ufb01cate validation code. Overall, we attribute most of the problems we \ufb01nd to insuf-\ufb01cient support for developers, missing clari\ufb01cation of security risks in of\ufb01cial documentation, and inadequate security checks for vulnerable applications in Google Play.",

        "abstract": "Fuzzing embeds a large number of decisions requiring \ufb01ne-tuned and hard-coded parameters to maximize its ef\ufb01ciency. This is especially true for kernel fuzzing due to (1) OS ker-nels\u2019 sheer size and complexity, (2) a unique syscall interface that requires special handling (e.g., encoding explicit dependencies among syscalls), and (3) behaviors of inputs (i.e., test cases) are often not reproducible due to the stateful nature of OS kernels. Hence, Syzkaller [14], the state-of-art gray-box kernel fuzzer, incorporates numerous procedures, decision points, and hard-coded parameters master-crafted by domain experts. Unfortunately, hard-coded strategies cannot adjust to factors such as different fuzzing environments/targets and the dynamically changing potency of tasks and/or seeds, limiting the overall effectiveness of the fuzzer. In this paper, we propose S YZ V EGAS , a fuzzer that dynamically and automatically adapts two of the most critical decision points in Syzkaller, task selection and seed selection , to remarkably improve coverage reached per unit-time. S YZ V EGAS \u2019s adaptation leverages multi-armed-bandit (MAB) algorithms along with a novel reward assessment model. Our extensive evaluations of S YZ V EGAS on the latest Linux Kernel and its subsystems demonstrate that it (i) \ufb01nds up to 38.7% more coverage than the default Syzkaller, (ii) better discovers bugs/crashes (8 more unique crashes) and (iii) has very low 2.1% performance overhead.

        "title": "PASAN: Detecting Peripheral Access Concurrency Bugs within Bare-Metal Embedded Applications",
        "abstract": "Concurrency bugs might be one of the most challenging software defects to detect and debug due to their non-deterministic triggers caused by task scheduling and interrupt handling. While different tools have been proposed to address concurrency issues, protecting peripherals in embedded systems from concurrent accesses impose unique challenges. A na\u00efve lock protection on a certain memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) address still allows concurrent accesses to other MMIO addresses of a peripheral. Meanwhile, embedded peripherals such as sensors often employ some internal state machines to achieve certain functionalities. As a result, improper locking can lead to the corruption of peripherals\u2019 on-going jobs (we call transaction corruption ) thus corrupted sensor values or failed jobs. In this paper, we propose a static analysis tool namely PAS AN to detect peripheral access concurrency issues for embedded systems. PAS AN automatically \ufb01nds the MMIO address range of each peripheral device using the parser-ready memory layout documents, extracts the peripheral\u2019s internal state machines using the corresponding device drivers, and detects concurrency bugs of peripheral accesses automatically. We evaluate PAS AN on seven different embedded platforms, including multiple real time operating systems (RTOSes) and robotic aerial vehicles (RAVs). PAS AN found 17 true positive concurrency bugs in total from three different platforms with the bug detection rates ranging from 40% to 100%. We have reported all our \ufb01ndings to the corresponding parties. To the best of our knowledge, PAS AN is the \ufb01rst static analysis tool detecting the intrinsic problems in concurrent peripheral accesses for embedded systems.",

        "title": "Incrementally Updateable Honey Password Vaults",
        "abstract": "Password vault applications allow a user to store multiple passwords in a vault and choose a master password to encrypt the vault. In practice, attackers may steal the storage file of the vault and further compromise all stored passwords by offline guessing the master password. Honey vaults have been proposed to address the threat. By producing plausible-looking decoy vaults for wrong master passwords, honey vaults force attackers to shift offline guessing to online verifications. However, the existing honey vault schemes all suffer from intersection attacks in the multi-leakage case where an old version of the storage file (e.g., a backup) is stolen along with the current version. The attacker can offline identify the decoys and completely break the schemes. We design a generic construction based on a multi-similar-password model and further propose an incremental update mechanism. With our mechanism, the attacker cannot get any extra advantages from the old storage, and therefore degenerates to an attacker only with knowledge of the current version. To further evaluate the security in the traditional single-leakage case where only the current version is stolen, we investigate the theoretically optimal strategy for online verifications, and propose practical attacks. Targeting the existing schemes, our attacks crack 33%\u201355% of real vaults via only one-time online guess and achieve 85%\u201394% accuracy in distinguishing real vaults from decoys. In contrast, our de-sign reduces the values of the two metrics to 2% and 58% (close to the ideal values 0% and 50%), respectively. This indicates that the attackers needs to carry out 2.8x\u20137.5x online verifications to break our scheme. Since online verifications can be quickly detected and prevented, our design achieves a significant improvement on security.",

        "title": "Examining the Efficacy of Decoy-based and Psychological Cyber Deception",
        "abstract": "The threat of cyber attacks is a growing concern across the world, leading to an increasing need for sophisticated cyber defense techniques. Attackers often rely on direct observation of cyber environments. This reliance provides opportunities for defenders to affect attacker perception and behavior by plying the powerful tools of defensive cyber deception. In this paper we analyze data from a controlled experiment designed to understand how defensive deception, both cyber and psychological, affects attackers [16]. Over 130 professional red teamers participated in a network penetration test in which both the presence and explicit mention of deceptive defensive techniques were controlled. While a detailed description of the experimental design and execution along with preliminary results related to red teamer characteristics has been published, it did not address any of the main hypotheses. Granted access to the cyber and self-report data collected from the ex-periment, this publication begins to address theses hypotheses by investigating the effectiveness of decoy systems for cyber defense through comparison of various measures of participant forward progress across the four experimental conditions. Results presented in this paper support a new \ufb01nding that the combination of the presence of decoys and information that deception is present has the greatest impact on cyber attack behavior, when compared to a control condition in which no deception was used.",

        "abstract": "Apple controls one of the largest mobile ecosystems, with 1.5 billion active devices worldwide, and offers twelve proprietary wireless Continuity services. Previous works have unveiled several security and privacy issues in the involved protocols. These works extensively studied AirDrop while the coverage of the remaining vast Continuity service space is still low. To facilitate the cumbersome reverse-engineering process, we describe the \ufb01rst guide on how to approach a structured analysis of the involved protocols using several vantage points available on macOS. Also, we develop a toolkit to automate parts of this otherwise manual process. Based on this guide, we analyze the full protocol stacks involved in three Continuity services, in particular, Handoff (HO), Universal Clipboard (UC), and Wi-Fi Password Sharing (PWS). We discover several vulnerabilities spanning from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisements to Apple\u2019s proprietary authentication protocols. These \ufb02aws allow for device tracking via HO\u2019s mDNS responses, a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on HO and UC, a DoS attack on PWS that prevents Wi-Fi password entry, and a machine-in-the-middle (MitM) attack on PWS that connects a target to an attacker-controlled Wi-Fi network. Our PoC implementations demonstrate that the attacks can be mounted using affordable off-the-shelf hardware ($20 micro:bit and a Wi-Fi card). Finally, we suggest practical mitigations and share our \ufb01ndings with Apple, who have started to release \ufb01xes through iOS and macOS updates.",

        "title": "SHARD: Fine-Grained Kernel Specialization with Context-Aware Hardening",
        "abstract": "With growing hardware complexity and ever-evolving user requirements, the kernel is increasingly bloated which increases its attack surface. Despite its large size, for speci\ufb01c applications and workloads, only a small subset of the kernel code is actually required. Kernel specialization approaches exploit this observation to either harden the kernel or restrict access to its code (debloating) on a per-application basis. However, existing approaches suffer from coarse specialization granularity and lack strict enforcement which limits their effectiveness. This paper presents S HARD , a practical framework to enforce \ufb01ne-grain kernel specialization. S HARD specializes at both the application and system call levels to signi\ufb01cantly restrict the kernel code exposed to attackers. Furthermore, S HARD introduces context-aware hardening to dynamically enable code hardening during suspicious execution contexts. S HARD implements an instance of a context-aware hardening scheme using control-\ufb02ow integrity (CFI), which provides near-native performance for non-hardened executions and strong security guarantees. Our analysis of the kernel attack surface reduction with S HARD as well as concrete attacks shows that S HARD exposes 181 \u00d7 less kernel code than the native kernel, an order of magnitude better than existing work, and prevents 90% of the evaluated attacks. Our evaluation shows that the average performance overhead of S HARD on real-world applications is moderate\u201410% to 36% on NG-INX, 3% to 10% on Redis, and 0% to 2.7% on the SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks.",

        "title": "T-Miner: A Generative Approach to Defend Against Trojan Attacks on DNN-based Text Classification",
        "abstract": "Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifiers are known to be vulnerable to Trojan or backdoor attacks, where the classifier is manipulated such that it misclassifies any input containing an attacker-determined Trojan trigger. Backdoors compromise a model's integrity, thereby posing a severe threat to the landscape of DNN-based classification. While multiple defenses against such attacks exist for classifiers in the image domain, there have been limited efforts to protect classifiers in the text domain. \nWe present Trojan-Miner (T-Miner) -- a defense framework for Trojan attacks on DNN-based text classifiers. T-Miner employs a sequence-to-sequence (seq-2-seq) generative model that probes the suspicious classifier and learns to produce text sequences that are likely to contain the Trojan trigger. T-Miner then analyzes the text produced by the generative model to determine if they contain trigger phrases, and correspondingly, whether the tested classifier has a backdoor. T-Miner requires no access to the training dataset or clean inputs of the suspicious classifier, and instead uses synthetically crafted \"nonsensical\" text inputs to train the generative model. We extensively evaluate T-Miner on 1100 model instances spanning 3 ubiquitous DNN model architectures, 5 different classification tasks, and a variety of trigger phrases. We show that T-Miner detects Trojan and clean models with a 98.75% overall accuracy, while achieving low false positives on clean models. We also show that T-Miner is robust against a variety of targeted, advanced attacks from an adaptive attacker.",

        "abstract": "There has been a recent surge in adversarial attacks on deep learning based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. These attacks pose new challenges to deep learning security and have raised significant concerns in deploying ASR systems in safety-critical applications. In this work, we introduce WaveGuard: a framework for detecting adversarial inputs that are crafted to attack ASR systems. Our framework incorporates audio transformation functions and analyses the ASR transcriptions of the original and transformed audio to detect adversarial inputs. We demonstrate that our defense framework is able to reliably detect adversarial examples constructed by four recent audio adversarial attacks, with a variety of audio transformation functions. With careful regard for best practices in defense evaluations, we analyze our proposed defense and its strength to withstand adaptive and robust attacks in the audio domain. We empirically demonstrate that audio transformations that recover audio from perceptually informed representations can lead to a strong defense that is robust against an adaptive adversary even in a complete white-box setting. Furthermore, WaveGuard can be used out-of-the box and integrated directly with any ASR model to efficiently detect audio adversarial examples, without the need for model retraining.",

        "title": "DRMI: A Dataset Reduction Technology based on Mutual Information for Black-box Attacks",
        "abstract": "It is non-trivial to attack deep neural networks in black-box settings without any model detail disclosed. Prior studies on black-box attacks leverage a number of queries to the target model for probing the target model or generating adversarial examples. Queries are usually limited and costly so that the adversary probably fails to mount an effective attack. However, not all the queries have to be made since there exist repetitions or redundancies that induce many inef\ufb01cient queries. Therefore, it leaves a lot of room for data reduction and more ef\ufb01cient queries. To this end, we \ufb01rst propose to use mutual information to measure the data redundancy between two data samples, and then develop a data reduction technique based on mutual information, termed as D R M I . We implement an ef\ufb01cient optimization algorithm in D R M I , so as to obtain a particular subset of data samples, of which the mutual information in between is minimized. We conduct extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet, and six types of deep neural networks, and evaluate D R M I in model extraction and adversarial attacks. The results demonstrate its high effectiveness in these attacks, surpassing a state-of-the-art approach by raising 7% of model accuracy and two times more transferability of adversarial examples. Through the comparison experiments with other three strategies, we identify what properties of data have been preserved and removed, to some extent reveal the essences of deep neural networks.",

        "abstract": "Trusted Execution Environments such as Intel SGX provide software applications with hardware support for preventing attacks from privileged software. However, these applications are still subject to rollback or replay attacks due to their lack of state continuity protection from the hardware. Therefore, maintaining state continuity has become a burden of software developers, which is not only challenging to implement but also dif\ufb01cult to validate. In this paper, we make the \ufb01rst attempt towards formally verifying the property of state continuity for SGX enclave programs by leveraging the symbolic veri\ufb01cation tool, Tamarin Prover, to model SGX-speci\ufb01c program semantics and operations, and verify the property of state continuity with respect to monotonic counters, global variables, and sealed data, respectively. We apply this method to analyze these three types of state continuity issues exhibited in three open-source SGX applications. We show that our method can successfully identify the \ufb02aws that lead to failures of maintaining state continuity, and formally verify the corrected implementation with respect to the desired property. The discovered \ufb02aws have been reported to the developers and some have been addressed.",

        "abstract": "Today, intelligent voice assistant (VA) software like Amazon's Alexa, Google's Voice Assistant (GVA) and Apple's Siri have millions of users. These VAs often collect and analyze huge user data for improving their functionality. However, this collected data may contain sensitive information (e.g., personal voice recordings) that users might not feel comfortable sharing with others and might cause significant privacy concerns. To counter such concerns, service providers like Google present their users with a personal data dashboard (called `My Activity Dashboard'), allowing them to manage all voice assistant collected data. However, a real-world GVA-data driven understanding of user perceptions and preferences regarding this data (and data dashboards) remained relatively unexplored in prior research. To that end, in this work we focused on Google Voice Assistant (GVA) users and investigated the perceptions and preferences of GVA users regarding data and dashboard while grounding them in real GVA-collected user data. Specifically, we conducted an 80-participant survey-based user study to collect both generic perceptions regarding GVA usage as well as desired privacy preferences for a stratified sample of their GVA data. We show that most participants had superficial knowledge about the type of data collected by GVA. Worryingly, we found that participants felt uncomfortable sharing a non-trivial 17.7% of GVA-collected data elements with Google. The current My Activity dashboard, although useful, did not help long-time GVA users effectively manage their data privacy. Our real-data-driven study found that showing users even one sensitive data element can significantly improve the usability of data dashboards. To that end, we built a classifier that can detect sensitive data for data dashboard recommendations with a 95% F1-score and shows 76% improvement over baseline models.",

        "abstract": "Through security contests such as Pwn2Own, we are constantly reminded that no complex piece of software should ever be considered secure. As we execute untrusted code in our browser every day, browser exploits written in JavaScript remain a constant threat to the security of our systems. In particular, evasive malware that detects analysis systems and then changes its behavior is a well-known problem. However, there are also anti-debugging techniques that interfere with the manual analysis of a website in a real browser. These techniques try to prevent, or at least slow down, any attempts at manually inspecting and debugging the JavaScript code of a website. For example, such a technique could constantly trigger breakpoints at random locations to effectively hinder single-stepping while debugging the code. More cunningly, it could also find out whether the browser\u2019s integrated Developer Tools are open by using certain sidechannels available in JavaScript. With this knowledge, it is possible to subtly alter or suppress any malicious behavior while under analysis. In this paper, we systematically explore this phenomenon. To this end, we introduce 9 anti-debugging techniques and discuss their advantages and drawbacks. We then conduct a large-scale study on 6 of them, to investigate the prevalence of these techniques in the wild. We find that as many as 1 out of 550 websites contain severe anti-debugging measures, with multiple of these techniques active on the same site. Moreover, we present a novel approach based on a deterministic website replay and a comparison of JavaScript code coverage. The approach can automatically detect the remaining 3 timingbased anti-debugging techniques, which use side-channels to learn if the DevTools are open. In a targeted study on 2000 websites with anti-debugging techniques, we discover over 200 of them indeed execute different code when under analysis.",

        "abstract": "Training pipelines for machine learning (ML) based malware classification often rely on crowdsourced threat feeds, exposing a natural attack injection point. In this paper, we study the susceptibility of feature-based ML malware classifiers to backdoor poisoning attacks, specifically focusing on challenging \u201cclean label\u201d attacks where attackers do not control the sample labeling process. We propose the use of techniques from explainable machine learning to guide the selection of relevant features and values to create effective backdoor triggers in a model-agnostic fashion. Using multiple reference datasets for malware classification, including Windows PE files, PDFs, and Android applications, we demonstrate effective attacks against a diverse set of machine learning models and evaluate the effect of various constraints imposed on the attacker. To demonstrate the feasibility of our backdoor attacks in practice, we create a watermarking utility for Windows PE files that preserves the binary\u2019s functionality, and we leverage similar behavior-preserving alteration methodologies for Android and PDF files. Finally, we experiment with potential defensive strategies and show the difficulties of completely defending against these attacks, especially when the attacks blend in with the legitimate sample distribution.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of programmable switches offers a new opportunity to revisit ISP-scale defenses for volumetric DDoS attacks. In theory, these can offer better cost vs. performance vs. \ufb02exibility trade-offs relative to proprietary hardware and virtual appliances. However, the ISP setting creates unique challenges in this regard\u2014we need to run a broad spectrum of detection and mitigation functions natively on the programmable switch hardware and respond to dynamic adaptive attacks at scale. Thus, prior efforts in using programmable switches that assume out-of-band detection and/or use switches merely as accelerators for speci\ufb01c tasks are no longer suf\ufb01cient, and as such, this potential remains unrealized. To tackle these challenges, we design and implement Jaqen, a switch-native approach for volumetric DDoS defense that can run detection and mitigation functions entirely inline on switches, without relying on additional data plane hardware. We design switch-optimized, resource-ef\ufb01cient detection and mitigation building blocks. We design a \ufb02exible API to construct a wide spectrum of best-practice (and future) defense strategies that ef\ufb01ciently use switch capabilities. We build a network-wide resource manager that quickly adapts to the attack posture changes. Our experiments show that Jaqen is orders of magnitude more performant than existing systems: Jaqen can handle large-scale hybrid and dynamic attacks within seconds, and mitigate them effectively at high line-rates (380 Gbps).",

        "abstract": "The ability to execute code in an emulator is a fundamental part of modern vulnerability testing. Unfortunately, this poses a challenge for many embedded systems, where firmware expects to interact with hardware devices specific to the target. Getting embedded system firmware to run outside its native environment, termed rehosting, requires emulating these hardware devices with enough accuracy to convince the firmware that it is executing on the target hardware. However, full fidelity emulation of target devices (which requires considerable engineering effort) may not be necessary to boot the firmware to a point of interest for an analyst (for example, a point where fuzzer input can be injected). We hypothesized that, for the firmware to boot successfully, it is sufficient to emulate only the behavior expected by the firmware, and that this behavior could be inferred automatically. To test this hypothesis, we developed and implemented Jetset, a system that uses symbolic execution to infer what behavior firmware expects from a target device. Jetset can generate devices models for hardware peripherals in C, allowing an analyst to boot the firmware in an emulator (e.g., QEMU). We successfully applied Jetset to thirteen distinct pieces of firmware together representing three architectures, three application domains (power grid, avionics, and consumer electronics), and five different operating systems. We also demonstrate how Jetset-assisted rehosting facilitates fuzztesting, a common security analysis technique, on an avionics embedded system, in which we found a previously unknown privilege escalation vulnerability.",

        "abstract": "Controller Area Network (CAN) has established itself as the main internal communication medium for vehicles. However, recent works have shown that error handling makes CAN nodes vulnerable to certain attacks. In the light of such a threat, we systematically analyze CAN\u2019s error handling and fault con\ufb01nement mechanism to investigate it for further vulnerabilities. In this paper, we develop CANOX, a testing tool that monitors the behavior of a CAN node under different bus and error conditions, and \ufb02ags conditions that cause an unexpected node behavior. Using CANOX, we found three major undiscovered vulnerabilities in the CAN standard that could be exploited to launch a variety of attacks. Combining the three vulnerabilities, we construct the Scan-Then-Strike Attack (S T S), a multi-staged attack in which an attacker with no previous knowledge of the vehicle\u2019s internals maps the vehicle\u2019s CAN bus, identi\ufb01es a safety-critical ECU, swiftly silences it, and persistently prevents it from recovering. We validate the practicality of S T S by evaluating it on a CAN bus testbed and a real vehicle.",

A pro-cessor\u2019s hardware components are classi\ufb01ed and managed through the core and the uncore. The uncore is the supporting hardware shared by the cores, hence the decision of turning it on/off depends on the cores\u2019 activities. Such dependency implies a covert channel threat in multi-core platforms. Specifically, the power status of the uncore re\ufb02ects the workload pattern of the active core, and it can be probed by any process running on the processor. This allows the process to infer the workload information of the active core. We show this covert channel can work across processors and violate VM isolation.

        "abstract": "End-host runtime monitors (e.g., CFI, system call IDS) \ufb02ag processes in response to symptoms of a possible attack. Unfortunately, the symptom (e.g., invalid control transfer) may occur long after the root cause (e.g., buffer over\ufb02ow), creating a gap whereby bug reports received by developers contain (at best) a snapshot of the process long after it executed the buggy instructions. To help system administrators provide developers with more concise reports, we propose ARCUS, an automated framework that performs root cause analysis over the execution \ufb02agged by the end-host monitor. ARCUS works by testing \u201cwhat if\u201d questions to detect vulnerable states, systematically localizing bugs to their concise root cause while \ufb01nding additional enforceable checks at the program binary level to demonstrably block them. Using hardware-supported processor tracing, ARCUS decouples the cost of analysis from host performance. We have implemented ARCUS and evaluated it on 31 vulnerabilities across 20 programs along with over 9,000 test cases from the RIPE and Juliet suites. ARCUS identi\ufb01es the root cause of all tested exploits \u2014 with 0 false positives or negatives \u2014 and even \ufb01nds 4 new 0-day vulnerabilities in traces averaging 4,000,000 basic blocks.

        "abstract": "Link-\ufb02ooding attacks (LFAs) aim to cut off an edge network from the Internet by congesting core network links. Such an adversary can further change the attack strategy dynamically (e.g., target links, traf\ufb01c types) to evade mitigation and launch persistent attacks. We develop Ripple , a programmable, decentralized link-\ufb02ooding defense against dynamic adversaries. Ripple can be programmed using a declarative policy language to emulate a range of state-of-the-art SDN defenses, but it enables the defenses to shapeshift on their own without a central controller. To achieve this, Ripple develops new defense primitives in programmable switches, which are con\ufb01gured by the policy language to implement a desired defense. The Ripple compiler generates a distributed set of switch programs to extract a panoramic view of attack signals and act against them in a fully decentralized manner, enabling successive waves of defenses against fast-changing attacks. We show that Ripple has low overheads, and that it can effectively recover traf\ufb01c throughput where SDN-based defenses fail.",

        "abstract": "With the ubiquity of data breaches, forgotten-about \ufb01les stored in the cloud create latent privacy risks. We take a holistic approach to help users identify sensitive, unwanted \ufb01les in cloud storage. We \ufb01rst conducted 17 qualitative interviews to characterize factors that make humans perceive a \ufb01le as sensitive, useful, and worthy of either protection or deletion. Building on our \ufb01ndings, we conducted a primarily quantitative online study. We showed 108 long-term users of Google Drive or Dropbox a selection of \ufb01les from their accounts. They labeled and explained these \ufb01les\u2019 sensitivity, usefulness, and desired management (whether they wanted to keep, delete, or protect them). For each \ufb01le, we collected many metadata and content features, building a training dataset of 3,525 labeled \ufb01les. We then built Aletheia, which predicts a \ufb01le\u2019s perceived sensitivity and usefulness, as well as its desired management. Aletheia improves over state-of-the-art baselines by 26% to 159%, predicting users\u2019 desired \ufb01le-management decisions with 79% accuracy. Notably, predicting subjective perceptions of usefulness and sensitivity led to a 10% absolute accuracy improvement in predicting desired \ufb01le-management decisions. Aletheia\u2019s performance validates a human-centric approach to feature selection when using inference techniques on subjective security-related tasks. It also improves upon the state of the art in minimizing the attack surface of cloud accounts.",

        "abstract": "The area of practical computational integrity proof systems, like SNARKs, STARKs, Bulletproofs, is seeing a very dynamic development with several constructions having appeared recently with improved properties and relaxed setup requirements. Many use cases of such systems involve, often as their most expensive part, proving the knowledge of a preimage under a certain cryptographic hash function, which is expressed as a circuit over a large prime \ufb01eld. A notable example is a zero-knowledge proof of coin ownership in the Zcash cryptocurrency, where the inadequacy of the SHA-256 hash function for such a circuit caused a huge computational penalty. In this paper, we present a modular framework and concrete instances of cryptographic hash functions which work natively with GF ( p ) objects. Our hash function P OSEIDON uses up to 8x fewer constraints per message bit than Pedersen Hash. Our construction is not only expressed compactly as a circuit, but can also be tailored for various proof systems using specially crafted polynomials, thus bringing another boost in performance. We demonstrate this by implementing a 1-out-of-a-billion membership proof with Merkle trees in less than a second by using Bulletproofs.",

        "title": "Communication-Efficient Triangle Counting under Local Differential Privacy",
        "abstract": "Triangle counting in networks under LDP (Local Differential Privacy) is a fundamental task for analyzing connection patterns or calculating a clustering coefficient while strongly protecting sensitive friendships from a central server. In particular, a recent study proposes an algorithm for this task that uses two rounds of interaction between users and the server to significantly reduce estimation error. However, this algorithm suffers from a prohibitively high communication cost due to a large noisy graph each user needs to download. In this work, we propose triangle counting algorithms under LDP with a small estimation error and communication cost. We first propose two-rounds algorithms consisting of edge sampling and carefully selecting edges each user downloads so that the estimation error is small. Then we propose a double clipping technique, which clips the number of edges and then the number of noisy triangles, to significantly reduce the sensitivity of each user's query. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that our algorithms dramatically reduce the communication cost of the existing algorithm, e.g., from 6 hours to 8 seconds or less at a 20 Mbps download rate, while keeping a small estimation error.",

        "title": "Static Detection of Unsafe DMA Accesses in Device Drivers",
        "abstract": "Direct Memory Access (DMA) is a popular mechanism for improving hardware I/O performance, and it has been widely used by many existing device drivers. However, DMA accesses can be unsafe, from two aspects. First, without proper synchronization of DMA buffers with hardware registers and CPU cache, the buffer data stored in CPU cache and hardware registers can be inconsistent, which can cause unexpected hardware behaviors. Second, a malfunctioning or untrusted hardware device can write bad data into system memory, which can trigger security bugs (such as buffer over\ufb02ow and invalid-pointer access), if the driver uses the data without correct validation. To detect unsafe DMA accesses, some key challenges need to be solved. For example, because each DMA access is implemented as a regular variable access in the driver code, identifying DMA accesses is dif\ufb01cult. In this paper, we propose a static-analysis approach named SADA, to automatically and accurately detect unsafe DMA accesses in device drivers. SADA consists of three basic steps. First, SADA uses a \ufb01eld-based alias analysis to identify DMA accesses, according to the information of DMA-buffer creation. Second, SADA uses a \ufb02ow-sensitive and pattern-based analysis to check the safety of each DMA access, to detect possible unsafe DMA accesses. Finally, SADA uses an SMT solver to validate the code-path condition of each possible unsafe DMA access, to drop false positives. We have evaluated SADA on the driver code of Linux 5.6, and found 284 real unsafe DMA accesses. Among them, we highlight that 121 can trigger buffer-over\ufb02ow bugs and 36 can trigger invalid-pointer accesses causing arbitrary read or write. We have reported these unsafe DMA accesses to Linux driver developers, and 105 of them have been con\ufb01rmed.",

Ultimately, the scam enables malicious actors to steal arbitrary goods from merchants with minimal investment.

        "abstract": "Taint analysis has been widely used in many security applications such as exploit detection, information \ufb02ow tracking, malware analysis, and protocol reverse engineering. State-of-the-art taint analysis tools are usually built atop dynamic binary instrumentation, which instruments at every possible instruction, and rely on runtime information to decide whether a particular instruction involves taint or not, thereby usually having high performance overhead. This paper presents S ELECTIVE - T AINT , an ef\ufb01cient selective taint analysis framework for binary executables. The key idea is to selectively instrument the instructions involving taint analysis using static binary rewriting instead of dynamic binary instrumentation. At a high level, S ELECTIVE T AINT statically scans taint sources of interest in the binary code, leverages value set analysis to conservatively determine whether an instruction operand needs to be tainted or not, and then selectively taints the instructions of interest. We have implemented S ELECTIVE T AINT and evaluated it with a set of binary programs including 16 coreutils (focusing on \ufb01le I/O) and \ufb01ve network daemon programs (focusing on network I/O) such as nginx web server. Our evaluation results show that the binaries statically instrumented by S E - LECTIVE T AINT has superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art dynamic taint analysis frameworks (e.g., 1.7x faster than that of libdft ).",

        "abstract": "In adversarial machine learning, new defenses against attacks on deep learning systems are routinely broken soon after their release by more powerful attacks. In this context, forensic tools can offer a valuable complement to existing defenses, by tracing back a successful attack to its root cause, and offering a path forward for mitigation to prevent similar attacks in the future. In this paper, we describe our efforts in developing a forensic traceback tool for poison attacks on deep neural networks. We propose a novel iterative clustering and pruning solution that trims\"innocent\"training samples, until all that remains is the set of poisoned data responsible for the attack. Our method clusters training samples based on their impact on model parameters, then uses an efficient data unlearning method to prune innocent clusters. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our system on three types of dirty-label (backdoor) poison attacks and three types of clean-label poison attacks, across domains of computer vision and malware classification. Our system achieves over 98.4% precision and 96.8% recall across all attacks. We also show that our system is robust against four anti-forensics measures specifically designed to attack it.",

        "abstract": "Mix network designs such as Loopix provide strong metadata anonymity guarantees that are crucial across many applications. However, because they limit the rate at which messages can be sent by each user, they incur high delays when sending many messages to multiple recipients \u2013 for instance, in decentralised collaborative apps. In this paper we present an ef\ufb01cient multicast scheme named Rollercoaster that reduces the time for delivering a message to all members of a group of size m from O ( m ) to O ( log m ) . Rollercoaster can be deployed without modi\ufb01ca-tions to the underlying mix network, allowing it to bene\ufb01t from the anonymity set provided by existing users. We further develop an extension that achieves the same asymptotic guarantees in the presence of unreliable group members. While the scheme is applicable to many mix network designs, we evaluate it for the Loopix network, which is the most advanced and practical design to date. For this evaluation we developed a network simulator that allows fast, reproducible, and inspectable runs while eliminating external in\ufb02uences.",

        "title": "Once is Never Enough: Foundations for Sound Statistical Inference in Tor Network Experimentation",
        "abstract": "Tor is a popular low-latency anonymous communication system that focuses on usability and performance: a faster network will attract more users, which in turn will improve the anonymity of everyone using the system. The standard practice for previous research attempting to enhance Tor performance is to draw conclusions from the observed results of a single simulation for standard Tor and for each research variant. But because the simulations are run in sampled Tor networks, it is possible that sampling error alone could cause the observed effects. Therefore, we call into question the practical meaning of any conclusions that are drawn without considering the statistical significance of the reported results. In this paper, we build foundations upon which we improve the Tor experimental method. First, we present a new Tor network modeling methodology that produces more representative Tor networks as well as new and improved experimentation tools that run Tor simulations faster and at a larger scale than was previously possible. We showcase these contributions by running simulations with 6,489 relays and 792k simultaneously active users, the largest known Tor network simulations and the first at a network scale of 100%. Second, we present new statistical methodologies through which we: (i) show that running multiple simulations in independently sampled networks is necessary in order to produce informative results; and (ii) show how to use the results from multiple simulations to conduct sound statistical inference. We present a case study using 420 simulations to demonstrate how to apply our methodologies to a concrete set of Tor experiments and how to analyze the results.",

        "title": "Automated Discovery of Denial-of-Service Vulnerabilities in Connected Vehicle Protocols",
        "abstract": "With the development of the emerging Connected Vehicle (CV) technology, vehicles can wirelessly communicate with traf\ufb01c infrastructure and other vehicles to exchange safety and mobility information in real time. However, the integrated communication capability inevitably increases the attack surface of vehicles, which can be exploited to cause safety hazard on the road. Thus, it is highly desirable to systematically understand design-level \ufb02aws in the current CV network stack as well as in CV applications, and the corresponding security/safety consequences so that these \ufb02aws can be proactively discovered and addressed before large-scale deployment. In this paper, we design CVAnalyzer , a system for discovering design-level \ufb02aws for availability violations of the CV network stack, as well as quantifying the corresponding security/safety consequences. To achieve this, CVAna-lyzer combines the attack discovery capability of a general model checker and the quantitative threat assessment capability of a probabilistic model checker. Using CVAnalyzer , we successfully uncovered 4 new DoS (Denial-of-Service) vulnerabilities of the latest CV network protocols and 14 new DoS vulnerabilities of two CV platoon management protocols. Our quanti\ufb01cation results show that these attacks can have as high as 99% success rates, and in the worst case can at least double the delay in packet processing, violating the latency requirement in CV communication. We implemented and validated all attacks in a real-world testbed, and also analyzed the fundamental causes to propose potential solutions. We have reported our \ufb01ndings in the CV network protocols to the IEEE 1609 Working Group, and the group has acknowledged the discovered vulnerabilities and plans to adopt our solutions.",

The specific transmission mechanisms end up relying on the knowledge and preferences of the parties involved. Through two online surveys ($n=60$ and $n=250$), we explore the various methods used to transmit sensitive documents, as well as the perceived risk and satisfaction with those methods. We find that users are more likely to recognize risk to data-at-rest after receipt (but not at the sender, namely, themselves). When not using an online portal provided by the recipient, participants primarily envision transmitting sensitive documents in person or via email, and have little experience using secure, privacy-preserving alternatives. Despite recognizing general risks, participants express high privacy satisfaction and convenience with actually experienced situations. These results suggest opportunities to design new solutions to promote securely sending sensitive materials, perhaps as new utilities within standard email workflows.",

        "abstract": "Causality analysis automates attack forensic and facilitates behavioral detection by associating causally related but temporally distant system events. Despite its proven usefulness, the analysis suffers from the innate big data challenge to store and process a colossal amount of system events that are constantly collected from hundreds of thousands of end-hosts in a realistic network. In addition, the effectiveness of the analysis to discover security breaches relies on the assumption that comprehensive historical events over a long span are stored. Hence, it is imminent to address the scalability issue in order to make causality analysis practical and applicable to the enterprise-level environment. In this work, we present SEAL, a novel data compression approach for causality analysis. Based on information-theoretic observations on system event data, our approach achieves lossless compression and supports near real-time retrieval of historic events. In the compression step, the causality graph induced by the system logs is investigated, and abundant edge reduction potentials are explored. In the query step, for maximal speed, decompression is opportunistically executed. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that SEAL offers 2.63x and 12.94x data size reduction, respectively. Besides, 89% of the queries are faster on the compressed dataset than the uncompressed one, and SEAL returns exactly the same query results as the uncompressed data.",

State-of-the-art models can reach within a few percentage points of fully-supervised training, while requiring 100x less labeled data. We study a new class of vulnerabilities: poisoning attacks that modify the unlabeled dataset. In order to be useful, unlabeled datasets are given strictly less review than labeled datasets, and adversaries can therefore poison them easily. By inserting maliciously-crafted unlabeled examples totaling just 0.1% of the dataset size, we can manipulate a model trained on this poisoned dataset to misclassify arbitrary examples at test time (as any desired label). Our attacks are highly effective across datasets and semi-supervised learning methods. We find that more accurate methods (thus more likely to be used) are significantly more vulnerable to poisoning attacks, and as such better training methods are unlikely to prevent this attack. To counter this we explore the space of defenses, and propose two methods that mitigate our attack.",

        "title": "Why TLS is better without STARTTLS: A Security Analysis of STARTTLS in the Email Context",
        "abstract": "TLS is one of today\u2019s most widely used and best-analyzed encryption technologies. However, for historical reasons, TLS for email protocols is often not used directly but negotiated via STARTTLS . This additional negotiation adds complexity and was prone to security vulnerabilities such as na\u00efve STARTTLS stripping or command injection attacks in the past. We perform the \ufb01rst structured analysis of STARTTLS in SMTP, POP3, and IMAP and introduce EAST, a semi-automatic testing toolkit with more than 100 test cases covering a wide range of variants of STARTTLS stripping, command and response injections, tampering attacks, and UI spoo\ufb01ng attacks for email protocols. Our analysis focuses on the con\ufb01dentiality and integrity of email submission (email client to SMTP server) and email retrieval (email client to POP3 or IMAP server). While some of our \ufb01ndings are also relevant for email transport (from one SMTP server to another), the security implications in email submission and retrieval are more critical because these connections involve not only individual email messages but also user credentials that allow access to a user\u2019s email archive. We used EAST to analyze 28 email clients and 23 servers. In total, we reported over 40 STARTTLS issues, some of which allow mailbox spoo\ufb01ng, credential stealing, and even the hosting of HTTPS with a cross-protocol attack on IMAP. We conducted an Internet-wide scan for the particularly dangerous command injection attack and found that 320.000 email servers (2% of all email servers) are affected. Surpris-ingly, several clients were vulnerable to STARTTLS stripping attacks. In total, only 3 out of 28 clients did not show any STARTTLS-speci\ufb01c security issues. Even though the command injection attack received multiple CVEs in the past, EAST detected eight new instances",

        "abstract": "AMD\u2019s Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) is a hardware extension available in AMD\u2019s EPYC server processors to support con\ufb01dential cloud computing. While various prior studies have demonstrated attacks against SEV by exploiting its lack of encryption in the VM control block or the lack of integrity protection of the encrypted memory and nested page tables, these issues have been addressed in the subsequent releases of SEV-Encrypted State (SEV-ES) and SEV-Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). In this paper, we study a previously unexplored vulnerability of SEV, including both SEV-ES and SEV-SNP. The vulnerability is dubbed ciphertext side channels, which allows the privileged adversary to infer the guest VM\u2019s execution states or recover certain plaintext. To demonstrate the severity of the vulnerability, we present the C IPHER L EAKS attack, which exploits the ciphertext side channel to steal private keys from the constant-time implementation of the RSA and the ECDSA in the latest OpenSSL library.",

        "abstract": "We are rethinking the decades-old design of the CAN bus by incorporating reactive defense capabilities in it. While its reliability and cost effectiveness turned CAN into the most widely used in-vehicle communication interface, its topology, physical layer and arbitration mechanism make it impossible to prevent certain types of adversarial activities on the bus. For example, DoS attacks cannot be stopped as the physical layer gives equal rights to all the connected ECUs and an adversary may exploit this by \ufb02ooding the network with high priority frames or cause transmission errors which may move honest ECUs into the bus-off state. In response to this, we propose a reactive mechanism based on relays placed along the bus that will change the network topology in case of an attack, i.e., a moving target defense mechanism, allowing a bus guardian to \ufb01lter and redirect legitimate traf\ufb01c. We take care of physical properties of the bus and keep the 120 \u03a9 load constant at the end of the lines whenever relays are triggered to modify the topology of the bus. We build a proof-of-concept implementation and test it in a laboratory setup with automotive-grade controllers that demonstrates its functionality over collected real-world in-vehicle traf\ufb01c. Our experiments show that despite short term disturbances when the relays are triggered, the frame loss is effectively zero.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned Vehicles (UVs) often consist of multiple Micro Controller Units (MCUs) as peripherals to interact with the physical world, including GPS sensors, barometers, motors, etc. While the attack vectors for UV vary, a number of UV attacks aim to impact the physical world either from the cyber or the physical space, e.g., hijacking the mission of UVs via malicious ground control commands or GPS spoo\ufb01ng. This provides us an opportunity to build a uni\ufb01ed and generic security framework defending against multiple kinds of UV attacks by monitoring the system\u2019s I/O activities. Accordingly, we build a security reference monitor for UVs by hooking into the memory-mapped I/O (MMIO), namely M2M ON . Instead of building upon existing RTOS, we implement M2M ON as a microkernel running in the privileged mode intercepting MMIOs while pushing the RTOS and applications into the unprivileged mode. We further instantiate an MMIO \ufb01rewall using M2M ON and demonstrate how to implement a secure Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) within M2M ON . Our evaluation on a real-world UV system shows that M2M ON incurs an 8.85% runtime overhead. Furthermore, M2M ON -based \ufb01rewall is able to defend against different cyber and physical attacks. The M2M ON microkernel contains less than 4K LoC comparing to the 3M LoC RTOS used in our evaluation. We believe M2M ON provides the \ufb01rst step towards building a trusted and practical security reference monitor for UVs.",

        "title": "When Malware Changed Its Mind: An Empirical Study of Variable Program Behaviors in the Real World",
        "abstract": "Behavioral program analysis is widely used for understanding malware behavior, for creating rule-based detectors, and for clustering samples into malware families. However, this approach is ineffective when the behavior of individual samples changes across different executions, owing to environment sensitivity, evasive techniques or time variability. While the inability to observe the complete behavior of a program is a well-known limitation of dynamic analysis, the prevalence of this behavior variability in the wild, and the behavior components that are most affected by it, are still unknown. As the behavioral traces are typically collected by executing the samples in a controlled environment, the models created and tested using such traces do not account for the broad range of behaviors observed in the wild, and may result in a false sense of security. In this paper we conduct the first quantitative analysis of behavioral variability in Windows malware, PUP and benign samples, using a novel dataset of 7.6M execution traces, recorded in 5.4M real hosts from 113 countries. We analyze program behaviors at multiple granularities, and we show how they change across hosts and across time. We then analyze the invariant parts of the malware behaviors, and we show how this affects the effectiveness of malware detection using a common class of behavioral rules. Our findings have actionable implications for malware clustering and detection, and they emphasize that program behavior in the wild depends on a subtle interplay of factors that may only be observed at scale, by monitoring malware on real hosts.",

        "abstract": "Push noti\ufb01cations can be a very useful feature. On web browsers, they allow users to receive timely updates even if the website is not currently open. On Chrome, the feature has become extremely popular since its inception in 2015, but it is also the least likely to be accepted by users. Chrome telemetry shows that, although 74% of all permission prompts are about noti\ufb01cations, they are also the least likely to be granted with only a 10% grant rate on desktop and 21% grant rate on Android. In order to preserve its utility for websites and to reduce unwanted interruptions and potential abuses for the users, we designed and tested both a novel UI and its activation mechanism for noti\ufb01cation permission prompts in Chrome. To understand how users interact with such prompts, we conducted two large-scale studies with more than 300 million users in the wild. The \ufb01rst study showed that most of them block or ignore the prompts across all types of web-sites, which prompted us to rethink its UI and activation logic. The second study, based on an A/B test using behavioral data from more than 40 million users who interacted with more than 100 million prompts on more than 70 thousand websites, show that the new prompt is very effective at reducing unwanted interruptions and their frequency (up to 30% fewer unnecessary actions on the prompts), with a minimal impact (less than 5%) on the grant rates, across all types of users and websites. We achieve these results thanks to a novel adaptive activation mechanism coupled with a block list of interrupting websites,",

We show that the current security model of Android, which limits security products to run as regular apps and prevents them from automatically removing malicious apps opens a significant window of opportunity for attackers. Such apps warn users about the newly discovered threats, but users do not promptly act on this information, allowing PHAs to persist on their device for an average of 24 days after they are detected. We also find that while app markets remove PHAs after these become known, there is a significant delay between when PHAs are identified and when they are removed: PHAs persist on Google Play for 77 days on average and 34 days on third party marketplaces. Finally, we find evidence of PHAs migrating to other marketplaces after being removed on the original one. This paper provides an unprecedented view of the Android PHA landscape, showing that current defenses against PHAs on Android are not as effective as commonly thought, and identifying multiple research directions that the security community should pursue, from orchestrating more effective PHA takedowns to devising better alerts for mobile security products.",

        "abstract": "Modern processors allow attackers to leak data during transient (i.e., mis-speculated) execution through microarchitectural covert timing channels. While initial defenses were channel-speci\ufb01c, recent solutions employ speculative information \ufb02ow control in an attempt to automatically mitigate attacks via any channel. However, we demonstrate that the current state-of-the-art defense fails to mitigate attacks using speculative stores, still allowing arbitrary data leakage during transient execution. Furthermore, we show that the state of the art does not scale to protect data in registers, incurring 30 . 8\u201363 . 4% overhead on SPEC 2017, depending on the threat model. We then present D OLMA , the \ufb01rst defense to automatically provide comprehensive protection against all known transient execution attacks. D OLMA combines a lightweight speculative information \ufb02ow control scheme with a set of secure performance optimizations. By enforcing a novel principle of transient non-observability , D OLMA ensures that a time slice on a core provides a unit of isolation in the context of existing attacks. Accordingly, D OLMA can allow speculative TLB/L1 cache accesses and variable-time arithmetic without loss of security. On SPEC 2017, D OLMA achieves comprehensive protection of data in memory at 10 . 2\u201329 . 7% overhead, adding protection for data in registers at 22 . 6\u201342 . 2% overhead (8 . 2\u2013 21 . 2% less than the state of the art, with greater security).",

        "title": "Bilingual Problems: Studying the Security Risks Incurred by Native Extensions in Scripting Languages",
        "abstract": "Scripting languages are continuously gaining popularity due to their ease of use and the flourishing software ecosystems that surround them. These languages offer crash and memory safety by design, thus, developers do not need to understand and prevent low-level security issues like the ones plaguing the C code. However, scripting languages often allow native extensions, which are a way for custom C/C++ code to be invoked directly from the high-level language. While this feature promises several benefits such as increased performance or the reuse of legacy code, it can also break the language's guarantees, e.g., crash-safety. In this work, we first provide a comparative analysis of the security risks of native extension APIs in three popular scripting languages. Additionally, we discuss a novel methodology for studying the misuse of the native extension API. We then perform an in-depth study of npm, an ecosystem which is most exposed to threats introduced by native extensions. We show that vulnerabilities in extensions can be exploited in their embedding library by producing reads of uninitialized memory, hard crashes or memory leaks in 33 npm packages, simply by invoking their API with well-crafted inputs. Moreover, we identify six open-source web applications in which such exploits can be deployed remotely by a weak adversary. Finally, we were assigned seven security advisories for the work presented in this paper, most labeled as high severity.",

        "abstract": "The prosperous development of cloud computing and machine learning as a service has led to the widespread use of media software to process confidential media data. This paper explores an adversary's ability to launch side channel analyses (SCA) against media software to reconstruct confidential media inputs. Recent advances in representation learning and perceptual learning inspired us to consider the reconstruction of media inputs from side channel traces as a cross-modality manifold learning task that can be addressed in a unified manner with an autoencoder framework trained to learn the mapping between media inputs and side channel observations. We further enhance the autoencoder with attention to localize the program points that make the primary contribution to SCA, thus automatically pinpointing information-leakage points in media software. We also propose a novel and highly effective defensive technique called perception blinding that can perturb media inputs with perception masks and mitigate manifold learning-based SCA. Our evaluation exploits three popular media software to reconstruct inputs in image, audio, and text formats. We analyze three common side channels - cache bank, cache line, and page tables - and userspace-only cache set accesses logged by standard Prime+Probe. Our framework successfully reconstructs high-quality confidential inputs from the assessed media software and automatically pinpoint their vulnerable program points, many of which are unknown to the public. We further show that perception blinding can mitigate manifold learning-based SCA with negligible extra cost.",

        "title": "Assessing Browser-level Defense against IDN-based Phishing",
        "abstract": "Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) allow people around the world to use their native languages for domain names. Unfortunately, because characters from different languages can look like each other, IDNs have been used to imperson-ate popular domains for phishing, i.e. , IDN homograph. To mitigate this risk, browsers have recently introduced defense policies. However, it is not yet well understood regarding how these policies are constructed and how effective they are. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of browser IDN policies, and a user study to understand user perception of homograph IDNs. We focus on 5 major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, and IE), and 2 mobile browsers (Android Chrome and iOS Safari) and analyze their current and historical versions released from January 2015 to April 2020. By treating each browser instance as a black box, we develop an automated tool to test the browser policies with over 9,000 testing cases. We \ufb01nd that all the tested browsers have weaknesses in their rules, leaving opportunities for attackers to craft homograph IDNs to impersonate target websites while bypassing browsers\u2019 defense. In addition, a browser\u2019s defense is not always getting stricter over time. For example, we observe Chrome has reversed its rules to re-allow certain homograph IDNs. Finally, our user study shows that the homograph IDNs that can bypass browsers\u2019 defense are still highly deceptive to users. Overall, our results suggest the need to improve the current defense against IDN homograph.",

        "title": "The Use of Likely Invariants as Feedback for Fuzzers",
        "abstract": "While fuzz testing proved to be a very effective technique to \ufb01nd software bugs, open challenges still exist. One of the its main limitations is the fact that popular coverage-guided designs are optimized to reach different parts of the program under test, but struggle when reachability alone is insuf\ufb01cient to trigger a vulnerability. In reality, many bugs require a speci\ufb01c program state that involve not only the control \ufb02ow, but also the values of some of the program variables. Unfortunately, alternative exploration strategies that have been proposed in the past to capture the program state are of little help in practice, as they immediately result in a state explosion. In this paper, we propose a new feedback mechanism that augments code coverage by taking into account the usual values and relationships among program variables. For this purpose, we learn likely invariants over variables at the basic-block level, and partition the program state space accordingly. Our feedback can distinguish when an input violates one or more invariants and reward it, thus re\ufb01ning the program state approximation that code coverage normally offers. We implemented our technique in a prototype called I NVS C OV , developed on top of LLVM and AFL ++ . Our experiments show that our approach can \ufb01nd more, and different, bugs with respect to fuzzers that use a pure code-coverage feedback. Furthermore, they led to the discovery of two vulnerabilities in a library tested daily on OSS-Fuzz, and still present at the time in its latest version.",

        "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) is an emerging technology that enables new applications but also introduces privacy risks. In this paper, we focus on Oculus VR (OVR), the leading platform in the VR space and we provide the first comprehensive analysis of personal data exposed by OVR apps and the platform itself, from a combined networking and privacy policy perspective. We experimented with the Quest 2 headset and tested the most popular VR apps available on the official Oculus and the SideQuest app stores. We developed OVRseen, a methodology and system for collecting, analyzing, and comparing network traffic and privacy policies on OVR. On the networking side, we captured and decrypted network traffic of VR apps, which was previously not possible on OVR, and we extracted data flows, defined as. Compared to the mobile and other app ecosystems, we found OVR to be more centralized and driven by tracking and analytics, rather than by third-party advertising. We show that the data types exposed by VR apps include personally identifiable information (PII), device information that can be used for fingerprinting, and VR-specific data types. By comparing the data flows found in the network traffic with statements made in the apps' privacy policies, we found that approximately 70% of OVR data flows were not properly disclosed. Furthermore, we extracted additional context from the privacy policies, and we observed that 69% of the data flows were used for purposes unrelated to the core functionality of apps.",

        "title": "YARIX: Scalable YARA-based Malware Intelligence",
        "abstract": "YARA is the industry standard to search for patterns in malware data sets. Malware analysts heavily rely on YARA rules to identify speci\ufb01c threats, e.g., by scanning unknown malware samples for patterns that are characteristic for a certain malware strain. While YARA is tremendously useful to in-spect individual \ufb01les, its run time grows linearly with the number of input \ufb01les, resulting in prohibitive performance penalties in large malware corpora. We present Y AR I X , a methodology to ef\ufb01ciently reveal \ufb01les matching arbitrary YARA rules. In order to scale to large malware corpora, Y AR I X uses an inverted n -gram index that maps \ufb01xed-length byte sequences to lists of \ufb01les in which they appear. To ef\ufb01ciently query such corpora, Y AR I X optimizes YARA searches by transforming YARA rules into index lookups to obtain a set of candidate \ufb01les that potentially match the rule. Given the storage demands that arise when indexing binary \ufb01les, Y AR I X compresses the disk footprint with variable byte delta encoding, abstracts from \ufb01le offsets, and leverages a novel grouping-based compression methodology. This completeness-preserving approximation will then be scanned using YARA to get the actual set of matching \ufb01les. Using 32M malware samples and 1404 YARA rules, we show that Y AR I X scales in both disk footprint and search performance. The index requires just \u2248 74% of the space required for storing the malware samples. Querying Y AR I X with a YARA rule in our test setup is \ufb01ve orders of magnitude faster than using standard sequential YARA scans.",

        "title": "PolyScope: Multi-Policy Access Control Analysis to Compute Authorized Attack Operations in Android Systems",
        "abstract": "Android\u2019s filesystem access control provides a foundation for system integrity. It combines mandatory (e.g., SEAndroid) and discretionary (e.g., Unix permissions) access control, protecting both the Android platform from Android/OEM services and Android/OEM services from third-party applications. However, OEMs often introduce vulnerabilities when they add market-differentiating features and fail to correctly reconfigure this complex combination of policies. In this paper, we propose the PolyScope tool to triage Android systems for vulnerabilities using their filesystem access control policies by: (1) identifying the resources that subjects are authorized to use that may be modified by their adversaries, both with and without policy manipulations, and (2) determining the attack operations on those resources that are actually available to adversaries to reveal the specific cases that need vulnerability testing. A key insight is that adversaries may exploit discretionary elements in Android access control to expand the permissions available to themselves and/or victims to launch attack operations, which we call permission expansion. We apply PolyScope to five Google and five OEM Android releases and find that permission expansion increases the privilege available to launch attacks, sometimes by more than 10x, but a significant fraction (about 15-20%) cannot be converted into attack operations due to other system configurations. Based on this analysis, we describe two previously unknown vulnerabilities and show how PolyScope helps OEMs triage the complex combination of access control policies down to attack operations worthy of testing.",

        "title": "Acoustics to the Rescue: Physical Key Inference Attack Revisited",
        "abstract": "Lock picking and key bumping are the most common attacks on traditional pin tumbler door locks. However, these approaches require physical access to the lock throughout the attack, increasing suspicion and chances of the attacker getting caught. To overcome this challenge, we propose Keynergy, a stealthy offline attack that infers key bittings (or secret) by substantially extending and improving prior work that only utilizes a still image of the key. Keynergy effectively utilizes the inherent audible \u201cclicks\u201d due to a victim\u2019s key insertion, together with video footage of the victim holding the key, in order to infer the victim\u2019s key\u2019s bittings. We evaluate Keynergy via a proof-of-concept implementation and real-world experiments comprising of participants that perform multiple key insertions across a total of 75 keys with the related audio recorded using different microphone types placed at varying distances. We demonstrate that Keynergy achieves an average reduction rate of around 75% with an acoustics-based approach alone. When we combine both acoustics and video together, Keynergy obtains a reduced keyspace below ten keys for 8% of the keys (i.e., six keys out of 75 keys tested).",

        "abstract": "Log is a key enabler of many security applications including but not limited to security auditing and forensic analysis. Due to the rapid growth of modern computing infrastructure size, software systems are generating more and more logs every day. Moreover, the duration of recent cyber attacks like Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) is becoming longer, and their targets consist of many connected organizations instead of a single one. This requires the analysis on logs from different sources and long time periods. Storing such large sized log \ufb01les is becoming more important and also challenging than ever. Existing logging systems are either inef\ufb01cient (i.e., high storage overhead) or designed for limited security applications (i.e., no support for general security analysis). In this paper, we propose E LISE , a storage ef\ufb01cient logging system built on top of a novel lossless data compression technique, which naturally supports all types of security analysis. It features lossless log compression using a novel log \ufb01le preprocessing and Deep Neural Network (DNN) based method to learn optimal character encoding. On average, E LISE can achieve 3 and 2 times better compression results compared with existing state-of-the-art methods Gzip and DeepZip, respectively, showing a promising future research direction.",

        "title": "Nyx: Greybox Hypervisor Fuzzing using Fast Snapshots and Affine Types",
        "abstract": "A hypervisor (also know as virtual machine monitor, VMM) enforces the security boundaries between different virtual machines (VMs) running on the same physical machine. A malicious user who is able to run her own kernel on a cloud VM can interact with a large variety of attack surfaces. Exploiting a software fault in any of these surfaces leads to full access to all other VMs that are co-located on the same host. Hence, the ef\ufb01cient detection of hypervisor vulnerabilities is crucial for the security of the modern cloud infrastructure. Recent work showed that blind fuzzing is the most ef\ufb01cient approach to identify security issues in hypervisors, mainly due to an outstandingly high test throughput. In this paper we present the design and implementation of N YX , a highly optimized, coverage-guided hypervisor fuzzer. We show how a fast snapshot restoration mechanism that allows us to reload the system under test thousands of times per second is key to performance. Furthermore, we introduce a novel mutation engine based on custom bytecode programs, encoded as directed acyclic graphs (DAG), and af\ufb01ne types, that enables the required \ufb02exibility to express complex interactions. Our evaluation shows that, while N YX has a lower throughput than the state-of-the-art hypervisor fuzzer, it performs competitively on simple targets: N YX typically requires only a few minutes longer to achieve the same test coverage. On complex devices, however, our approach is able to signi\ufb01-cantly outperform existing works. Moreover, we are able to uncover substantially more bugs: in total, we uncovered 44 new bugs with 22 CVEs requested. Our results demonstrate that coverage guidance is highly valuable, even if a blind fuzzer can be signi\ufb01cantly faster.",

        "title": "LTrack: Stealthy Tracking of Mobile Phones in LTE",
        "abstract": "We introduce LTrack, a new tracking attack on LTE that allows an attacker to stealthily extract user devices' locations and permanent identifiers (IMSI). To remain stealthy, the localization of devices in LTrack is fully passive, relying on our new uplink/downlink sniffer. Our sniffer records both the times of arrival of LTE messages and the contents of the Timing Advance Commands, based on which LTrack calculates locations. LTrack is the first to show the feasibility of a passive localization in LTE through implementation on software-defined radio. Passive localization attacks reveal a user's location traces but can at best link these traces to a device's pseudonymous temporary identifier (TMSI), making tracking in dense areas or over a long time-period challenging. LTrack overcomes this challenge by introducing and implementing a new type of IMSI Catcher named IMSI Extractor. It extracts a device's IMSI and binds it to its current TMSI. Instead of relying on fake base stations like existing IMSI Catchers, which are detectable due to their continuous transmission, IMSI Extractor relies on our uplink/downlink sniffer enhanced with surgical message overshadowing. This makes our IMSI Extractor the stealthiest IMSI Catcher to date. We evaluate LTrack through a series of experiments and show that in line-of-sight conditions, the attacker can estimate the location of a phone with less than 6m error in 90% of the cases. We successfully tested our IMSI Extractor against a set of 17 modern smartphones connected to our industry-grade LTE testbed. We further validated our uplink/downlink sniffer and IMSI Extractor in a test facility of an operator.",

DICE? is proved to be functionally correct, memorysafe, and resistant to timingand cache-based side-channels. A key component of DICE? is a verified certificate creation library for a fragment of X.509. We have integrated DICE? into the boot firmware of an STM32H753ZI micro-controller.

        "abstract": "We conduct a global study on the behaviors, expectations and engagement of 1,719 participants across 10 countries and regions towards Android application permissions. Participants were recruited using mobile advertising and used an application we designed for 30 days. Our app samples user behaviors (decisions made), rationales (via in-situ surveys), expectations, and attitudes, as well as some app provided explanations. We study the grant and deny decisions our users make, and build mixed effect logistic regression models to illustrate the many factors that influence this decision making. Among several interesting findings, we observed that users facing an unexpected permission request are more than twice as likely to deny it compared to a user who expects it, and that permission requests accompanied by an explanation have a deny rate that is roughly half the deny rate of app permission requests without explanations. These findings remain true even when controlling for other factors. To the best of our knowledge, this may be the first study of actual privacy behavior (not stated behavior) for Android apps, with users using their own devices, across multiple continents.",

        "abstract": "We investigate a simple but overlooked folklore approach for searching encrypted documents held at an untrusted service: Just stash an index (with unstructured encryption) at the service and download it for updating and searching. This approach is simple to deploy, enables rich search support beyond unsorted keyword lookup, requires no persistent client state, and (intuitively at least) provides excellent security compared with approaches like dynamic searchable symmetric encryption (DSSE). This work first shows that implementing this construct securely is more subtle than it appears, and that naive implementations with commodity indexes are insecure due to the leakage of the byte-length of the encoded index. We then develop a set of techniques for encoding indexes, called size-locking, that eliminates this leakage. Our key idea is to fix the size of indexes to depend only on features that are safe to leak. We further develop techniques for securely partitioning indexes into smaller pieces that are downloaded, trading leakage for large increases in performance in a measured way. We implement our systems and evaluate that they provide search quality matching plaintext systems, support for stateless clients, and resistance to damaging injection attacks.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning has continued to show promising results for malware classi\ufb01cation. However, to identify key malicious behaviors, malware analysts are still tasked with reverse engineering unknown malware binaries using static analysis tools, which can take hours. Although machine learning can be used to help identify important parts of a binary, supervised approaches are impractical due to the expense of acquiring a suf\ufb01ciently large labeled dataset. To increase the productivity of static (or manual) reverse engineering, we propose D EEP R EFLECT : a tool for localizing and identifying malware components within a malicious binary. To localize malware components, we use an unsupervised deep neural network in a novel way, and classify the components through a semi-supervised cluster analysis, where analysts incrementally provide labels during their daily work \ufb02ow. The tool is practical since it requires no data labeling to train the localization model, and minimal/noninvasive labeling to train the classi\ufb01er incrementally.

        "abstract": "The adversarial patch attack against image classification models aims to inject adversarially crafted pixels within a restricted image region (i.e., a patch) for inducing model misclassification. This attack can be realized in the physical world by printing and attaching the patch to the victim object; thus, it imposes a real-world threat to computer vision systems. To counter this threat, we design PatchCleanser as a certifiably robust defense against adversarial patches. In PatchCleanser, we perform two rounds of pixel masking on the input image to neutralize the effect of the adversarial patch. This image-space operation makes PatchCleanser compatible with any state-of-the-art image classifier for achieving high accuracy. Furthermore, we can prove that PatchCleanser will always predict the correct class labels on certain images against any adaptive white-box attacker within our threat model, achieving certified robustness. We extensively evaluate PatchCleanser on the ImageNet, ImageNette, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and Flowers-102 datasets and demonstrate that our defense achieves similar clean accuracy as state-of-the-art classification models and also significantly improves certified robustness from prior works. Remarkably, PatchCleanser achieves 83.9% top-1 clean accuracy and 62.1% top-1 certified robust accuracy against a 2%-pixel square patch anywhere on the image for the 1000-class ImageNet dataset.",

        "title": "DEFInit: An Analysis of Exposed Android Init Routines",
        "abstract": "During the booting process of an Android device, a special daemon called Init is launched by the kernel as the \ufb01rst user-space process. Android allows vendors to extend the behavior of Init by introducing custom routines in .rc \ufb01les. These Init routines can also be triggered by privileged pre-installed apps in a certain manner to accomplish privileged functionalities. However, as these pre-installed apps may fail to properly protect access to code sites triggering these Init routines, the capabilities of these routines may leak to unprivileged apps, resulting in crossing security boundaries set by the system. To this end, this study aims at investigating the prevalence of these Init routines and their security impact. We present DEFI NIT as a tool to help automate the process of identifying Init routines exposed by pre-installed apps and estimating their potential security impact. Our \ufb01ndings are alarming. We found that custom Init routines added by vendors were substantial and had signi\ufb01cant security impact. On a data set of 259 \ufb01rmware from the top 21 vendors worldwide, we iden-ti\ufb01ed 1 , 947 exposed custom Init routines in 101 \ufb01rmware from 13 vendors. Of these routines, 515 performed at least one sensitive action. We veri\ufb01ed 89 instances spanning 30 \ufb01rmware from 6 vendors, allowing unprivileged apps to perform sensitive functionalities without user interaction, including disabling SELinux enforcement, snif\ufb01ng network traf\ufb01c, reading system logs, among others.",

        "title": "DoubleStar: Long-Range Attack Towards Depth Estimation based Obstacle Avoidance in Autonomous Systems",
        "abstract": "Depth estimation-based obstacle avoidance has been widely adopted by autonomous systems (drones and vehicles) for safety purpose. It normally relies on a stereo camera to automatically detect obstacles and make flying/driving decisions, e.g., stopping several meters ahead of the obstacle in the path or moving away from the detected obstacle. In this paper, we explore new security risks associated with the stereo vision-based depth estimation algorithms used for obstacle avoidance. By exploiting the weaknesses of the stereo matching in depth estimation algorithms and the lens flare effect in optical imaging, we propose DoubleStar, a long-range attack that injects fake obstacle depth by projecting pure light from two complementary light sources. DoubleStar includes two distinctive attack formats: beams attack and orbs attack, which leverage projected light beams and lens flare orbs respectively to cause false depth perception. We successfully attack two commercial stereo cameras designed for autonomous systems (ZED and Intel RealSense). The visualization of fake depth perceived by the stereo cameras illustrates the false stereo matching induced by DoubleStar. We further use Ardupilot to simulate the attack and demonstrate its impact on drones. To validate the attack on real systems, we perform a real-world attack towards a commercial drone equipped with state-of-the-art obstacle avoidance algorithms. Our attack can continuously bring a flying drone to a sudden stop or drift it away across a long distance under various lighting conditions, even bypassing sensor fusion mechanisms. Specifically, our experimental results show that DoubleStar creates fake depth up to 15 meters in distance at night and up to 8 meters during the daytime. To mitigate this newly discovered threat, we provide discussions on potential countermeasures to defend against DoubleStar.",

Chief Information Security Of\ufb01cers (CISOs) have a key role in contextualizing trade-offs between competing costs and priorities for SB management. To explore the challenges CISOs face when guiding SBs towards improved security we conducted two interview studies. Firstly, an exploratory study with CISOs with SB experience to identify themes related to their work (n=8). Secondly, we re\ufb01ned our methods and conducted broader structured interviews with a larger non-overlapping group of similarly quali\ufb01ed SB CISOs (n=19) to validate those themes and extend outcomes. We found CISOs con\ufb01rmed common observations that SBs are generally unprepared for online threats, and uninformed about issues such as insurance and regulation. We also found that despite perceived usability problems with language and formatting, the effectiveness of government-authored guidance (a key reference source for CISOs and SBs) was deemed on par with commercial resources. These observations yield recommendations for better formatting, prioritizing, and timing of security guidance for SBs, such as better tailoring checklists, investment suggestions, and scenario-based exercises.",

        "abstract": "Democracy Live\u2019s OmniBallot platform is a web-based system for blank ballot delivery, ballot marking, and online voting. In early 2020, three states\u2014Delaware, West Virginia, and New Jersey\u2014announced that they would allow certain voters to cast votes online using OmniBallot, but, despite the well established risks of Internet voting, the system has never before undergone a public, independent security review. We reverse engineered the client-side portion of Omni-Ballot, as used in Delaware, in order to detail the system\u2019s operation and analyze its security. We \ufb01nd that OmniBallot uses a simplistic approach to Internet voting that is vulnerable to vote manipulation by malware on the voter\u2019s device and by insiders or other attackers who can compromise Democracy Live, Amazon, Google, or Cloud\ufb02are. In addition, Democracy Live, which had no privacy policy prior to our work, receives sensitive personally identi\ufb01able information\u2014including the voter\u2019s identity, ballot selections, and browser \ufb01ngerprint\u2014 that could be used to target political ads or disinformation campaigns. Even when OmniBallot is used to mark ballots that will be printed and returned in the mail, the software sends the voter\u2019s identity and ballot choices to Democracy Live, an unnecessary risk that jeopardizes the secret ballot. We recommend changes to make the platform safer for ballot delivery and marking. However, we conclude that using OmniBallot for electronic ballot return represents a severe risk to election security and could allow attackers to alter election results without detection. In response to our \ufb01ndings, Delaware and New Jersey halted their use of OmniBallot for online voting, but it remains available in other jurisdictions, as do similar tools that likely face the same serious risks.",

        "abstract": "We debut domain shadowing , a novel censorship evasion technique leveraging content delivery networks (CDNs). Domain shadowing exploits the fact that CDNs allow their customers to claim arbitrary domains as the back-end. By setting the front-end of a CDN service as an allowed domain and the back-end a blocked one, a censored user can access resources of the blocked domain with all \u201cindicators\u201d, including the connecting URL, the SNI of the TLS connection, and the Host header of the HTTP(S) request, appear to belong to the allowed domain. Furthermore, we demonstrate that domain shadowing can be proliferated by domain fronting , a censorship evasion technique popularly used a few years ago, making it even more dif\ufb01cult to block. Compared with existing censorship evasion solutions, domain shadowing is lightweight, incurs negligible overhead, and does not require dedicated third-party support. As a proof of concept, we implemented domain shadowing as a Firefox browser extension and demonstrated its capability in circumventing censorship within a heavily censored country known by its strict censor-ship policies and advanced technologies.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, we have seen a great deal of both academic and practical interest in the topic of vulnerabilities in smart contracts, particularly those developed for the Ethereum blockchain. While most of the work has focused on detecting vulnerable contracts, in this paper, we focus on \ufb01nding how many of these vulnerable contracts have actually been exploited . We survey the 23,327 vulnerable contracts reported by six recent academic projects and \ufb01nd that, despite the amounts at stake, only 1.98% of them have been exploited since deployment. This corresponds to at most 8,487 ETH (~1.7 million USD 1 ), or only 0.27% of the 3 million ETH (600 million USD) at stake. We explain these results by demonstrating that the funds are very concentrated in a small number of contracts which are not exploitable in practice.",

        "abstract": "Most EMV transactions require online authorization by the card issuer. Namely, the merchant\u2019s payment terminal sends an authorization request to the card issuer over a payment network, typically operated by the company that brands the card such as Visa or Mastercard. In this paper we show that it is possible to induce a mismatch between the card brand and the payment network, from the terminal\u2019s perspective. The resulting card brand mixup attack has serious security consequences. In particular, it enables criminals to use a vic-tim\u2019s Mastercard contactless card to pay for expensive goods without knowing the card\u2019s PIN. Concretely, the attacker fools the terminal into believing that the card being used is a Visa card and then applies the recent PIN bypass attack that we reported on Visa. We have built an Android application and successfully used it to carry out this attack for transactions with both Mastercard debit and credit cards, including a transaction for over 400 USD with a Maestro debit card. Finally, we extend our formal model of the EMV contactless protocol to machine-check \ufb01xes to the issues found.",

        "abstract": "The recent rise of Smart IoT devices has opened new doors for cyber criminals to achieve damages unique to the ecosys-tem. SmartTVs, the most widely adopted home-based IoT devices, are no exception. Albeit their popularity, little has been done to evaluate their security and associated risks. To proactively address the problem, we propose a systematic evaluation of Android SmartTVs security. We overcome a number of prominent challenges such as most of the added TV related functionalities are (partially) implemented in the native layer and many security problems only manifest themselves on the physical aspect without causing any misbehaviors inside the OS. We develop a novel dynamic fuzzing approach, which features an on-the-\ufb02y log-based input speci\ufb01cation derivation and feedback collection. Our solution further introduces a novel external observer that monitors the TV-related physical symptoms (i.e., visual and auditory) to detect potential physical anomalies. We leverage our technique to analyze 11 Android TV Boxes. Our analysis reveals 37 unique vulnerabilities, leading to high-impact cyber threats (e.g., corrupting critical boot environment settings and accessing highly-sensitive data), memory corruptions, and even visual and auditory disturbances (e.g., persistent display content corruption and audio muting).",

        "abstract": "OS kernels are full of bugs resulting in security, reliability, and usability issues. Several kernel fuzzers have recently been developed to find these bugs and have proven to be effective. Yet, bugs take several months to be patched once they are discovered. In this window of vulnerability, bugs continue to pose concerns. We present workarounds for kernel bugs, called bowknots, which maintain the functionality of the system even when bugs are triggered, are applicable to many kernel bugs, do not cause noticeable performance overhead, and have a small kernel footprint. The key idea behind bowknots is to undo the side effects of the in-flight syscall that triggers a bug, effectively neutralizing the syscall. We also present a static analysis tool, called Hecaton, that generates bowknots automatically and inserts them into the kernel. Through extensive evaluations on the kernel of Android devices as well as x86 upstream kernels, we demonstrate that bowknots are effective in mitigating kernel bugs and vulnerabilities. We also show that Hecaton is capable of generating the right bowknots fully automatically in majority of cases, and requires minimal help from the analyst for the rest. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of bowknots in improving the efficiency of kernel fuzzing by eliminating repetitive reboots.",

        "abstract": "Cybercriminal entrepreneurs on online anonymous markets rely on security mechanisms to thwart investigators in at-tributing their illicit activities. Earlier work indicates that \u2013 despite the high-risk criminal context \u2013 cybercriminals may turn to poor security practices due to competing business incentives. This claim has not yet been supported through empirical, quantitative analysis on ground-truth data. In this paper, we investigate the security practices on Hansa Market (2015-2017) and measure the prevalence of poor security practices across the vendor population ( n = 1 , 733). We create \u2018vendor types\u2019 based on latent pro\ufb01le analysis, clustering vendors that are similar regarding their experience, activity on other markets, and the amount of physical and digital items sold. We then analyze how these types of vendors differ in their security practices. To that end, we capture their password strength and password uniqueness, 2FA usage, PGP adoption and key strength, PGP-key reuse and the traceability of their cash-out. We \ufb01nd that insecure practices are prevalent across all types of vendors. Yet, between them large differences exist. Rather counter-intuitively, Hansa Market vendors that sell digital items \u2013 like stolen credit cards or malware \u2013 resort to insecure practices more often than vendors selling drugs. We discuss possible explanations, including that vendors of illicit digital items may perceive their risk to be lower than vendors of illicit physical items.",

        "abstract": "The 3GPP consortium has published the Authentication and Key Agreement protocol for the 5th generation (5G) mobile communication system (i.e., 5G-AKA) by Technical Specification (TS) 33.501. It introduces public key encryption to conceal the so-called SUPIs so as to enhance mobile users\u2019 privacy. However, 5G-AKA is only privacy-preserving at the presence of passive attackers, and is still vulnerable to the linkability attacks from active attackers. An active attacker can track target mobile phones via performing these attacks, which puts the privacy of users at risk. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving solution for the AKA protocol of 5G system denoted by 5G-AKA\u2032. It is resistant to linkability attacks performed by active attackers, and is compatible with the SIM cards and currently deployed Serving Networks (SNs). In particular, we first conduct an analysis on the known linkability attacks in 5G-AKA, and find out a root cause of all attacks. Then, we design a countermeasure with the inherent key encapsulation mechanism of ECIES (i.e., ECIES-KEM), and use the shared key established by ECIES-KEM to encrypt the challenges sent by a Home Network (HN). With this measure, a target User Equipment (UE) who receives a message replayed from its previously attended sessions behaves as non-target UEs, which prevents the attacker from distinguishing the UE by linking it with its previous sessions. Moreover, 5G-AKA\u2032 does not raise additional bandwidth cost, and only introduces limited additional time costs from 0.02% to 0.03%. Finally, we use a stateof-the-art formal verification tool, Tamarin prover, to prove that 5G-AKA\u2032 achieves the desired security goals of privacy, authentication and secrecy.",

        "abstract": "Modern secure messaging protocols can offer strong security guarantees such as Post-Compromise Security (PCS) [18], which enables participants to heal after compromise. The core PCS mechanism in protocols like Signal [34] is designed for pairwise communication, making it inef\ufb01cient for large groups, while recently proposed designs for secure group messaging, ART [19], IETF\u2019s MLS Draft-11 [7]/TreeKEM [11], use group keys derived from tree structures to ef\ufb01ciently provide PCS to large groups. Until now, research on PCS designs only considered healing behaviour within a single group. In this work we provide the \ufb01rst analysis of the healing behaviour when a user participates in multiple groups. Sur-prisingly, our analysis reveals that the currently proposed protocols based on group keys, such as ART and TreeKEM/MLS Draft-11, provide signi\ufb01cantly weaker PCS guarantees than group protocols based on pairwise PCS channels. In fact, we show that if new users can be created dynamically, ART, TreeKEM, and MLS Draft-11 never fully heal authentication. We map the design space of healing mechanisms, analyz-ing security and overhead of possible solutions. This leads us to a promising solution based on (i) global updates that affect all current and future groups, and (ii) post-compromise secure signatures . Our solution allows group messaging protocols such ART and MLS to achieve substantially stronger PCS guarantees. We provide a security de\ufb01nition for post-compromise secure signatures and an instantiation.",

        "abstract": "Mandatory Access Control (MAC) has provided a great contribution to the improvement of the security of modern operating systems. A clear demonstration is represented by Android, which has progressively assigned a greater role to SELinux since its introduction in 2013. These bene\ufb01ts have been mostly dedicated to the protection of system components against the behavior of apps and no control is offered to app developers on the use of MAC. Our solution overcomes this limitation, giving developers the power to de\ufb01ne ad-hoc MAC policies for their apps, supporting the internal compartmentalization of app components. This is a natural evolution of the security mechanisms already available in Android, but its realization requires to consider that (i) the security of system components must be maintained, (ii) the solution must be usable by developers, and (iii) the performance impact should be limited. Our proposal meets these three requirements. The proposal is supported by an open-source implementation.",

        "title": "Preventing Use-After-Free Attacks with Fast Forward Allocation",
        "abstract": "Memory-unsafe languages are widely used to implement critical systems like kernels and browsers, leading to thousands of memory safety issues every year. A use-after-free bug is a temporal memory error where the program accidentally visits a freed memory location. Recent studies show that useafter-free is one of the most exploited memory vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, previous efforts to mitigate use-after-free bugs are not widely deployed in real-world programs due to either inadequate accuracy or high performance overhead. In this paper, we propose to resurrect the idea of one-time allocation (OTA) and provide a practical implementation with efficient execution and moderate memory overhead. With onetime allocation, the memory manager always returns a distinct memory address for each request. Since memory locations are not reused, attackers cannot reclaim freed objects, and thus cannot exploit use-after-free bugs. We utilize two techniques to render OTA practical: batch page management and the fusion of bump-pointer and fixed-size bins memory allocation styles. Batch page management helps reduce the number of system calls which negatively impact performance, while blending the two allocation methods mitigates the memory overhead and fragmentation issues. We implemented a prototype, called FFmalloc, to demonstrate our techniques. We evaluated FFmalloc on widely used benchmarks and real-world large programs. FFmalloc successfully blocked all tested useafter-free attacks while introducing moderate overhead. The results show that OTA can be a strong and practical solution to thwart use-after-free threats.",

        "title": "Swivel: Hardening WebAssembly against Spectre",
        "abstract": "We describe Swivel, a new compiler framework for hardening WebAssembly (Wasm) against Spectre attacks. Outside the browser, Wasm has become a popular lightweight, in-process sandbox and is, for example, used in production to isolate different clients on edge clouds and function-as-a-service platforms. Unfortunately, Spectre attacks can bypass Wasm's isolation guarantees. Swivel hardens Wasm against this class of attacks by ensuring that potentially malicious code can neither use Spectre attacks to break out of the Wasm sandbox nor coerce victim code-another Wasm client or the embedding process-to leak secret data. We describe two Swivel designs, a software-only approach that can be used on existing CPUs, and a hardware-assisted approach that uses extension available in Intel 11th generation CPUs. For both, we evaluate a randomized approach that mitigates Spectre and a deterministic approach that eliminates Spectre altogether. Our randomized implementations impose under 10.3% overhead on the Wasm-compatible subset of SPEC 2006, while our deterministic implementations impose overheads between 3.3% and 240.2%. Though high on some benchmarks, Swivel's overhead is still between 9x and 36.3x smaller than existing defenses that rely on pipeline fences.",

        "title": "Saphire: Sandboxing PHP Applications with Tailored System Call Allowlists",
        "abstract": "Interpreted languages, such as PHP, power a host of platform-independent applications, including websites, instant messengers, video games, and development environments. With the \ufb02ourishing popularity of these applications, attackers have honed in on \ufb01nding and exploiting vulnerabilities in interpreted code. Generally, all parts of an interpreted application execute with uniform and super\ufb02uous privileges, increasing the potential damage from an exploit. This lack of privilege-separation is in stark violation of the principle of least privilege(PoLP). Despite 1,980 web app remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities discovered in 2018 alone [25], current defenses rely on incomplete detection of vulnerable code, or extensive collections of benign inputs. Considering the limitations of bug-\ufb01nding systems, the violation of the PoLP exposes systems to unnecessarily-high risks. In this paper, we identify the current challenges with applying the PoLP to interpreted PHP applications, and propose a novel generic approach for automatically deriving system-call policies for individual interpreted programs. This effectively reduces the attack surface (i.e., set of system-calls) an exploit can leverage to the system-calls the script needs to perform its benign functionality. We name our implementation of this approach, Saphire, and thoroughly evaluate the prototype with respect to its security and performance characteristics. Our evaluation on 21 known vulnerable web apps and plugins shows that Saphire successfully prevents RCE exploits, and is able to do so with negligible performance overhead (i.e., <2% in the worst case) for real-world web apps. Saphire performs its service without causing false positives over automatically and manually generated benign traf\ufb01c to each web app.",

        "abstract": "Brainwaves have proved to be unique enough across individuals to be useful as biometrics. They also provide promising advantages over traditional means of authentication, such as resistance to external observability, revocability, and intrinsic liveness detection. However, most of the research so far has been conducted with expensive, bulky, medical-grade helmets, which offer limited applicability for everyday usage. With the aim to bring brainwave authentication and its bene\ufb01ts closer to real world deployment, we investigate brain biometrics with consumer devices. We conduct a comprehensive experiment that compares \ufb01ve authentication tasks on a user sample up to 10 times larger than those from previous studies, introducing three novel techniques based on cognitive semantic processing. We analyze both the performance and usability of the different options and use this evidence to elicit design and research recommendations. Our results show that it is possible to achieve Equal Error Rates of 14.5% (a reduction between 37%-44% with respect to existing approaches) based on brain responses to images with current inexpensive technology. With regard to adoption, users call for simpler devices, faster authentication, and better privacy.",

Improving political campaign security is a vital part of protecting democracy. To identify campaign security issues, we conducted qualitative research with 28 participants across the U.S. political spectrum to understand the digital security practices, challenges, and perceptions of people involved in campaigns. A main, overarching finding is that a unique combination of threats, constraints, and work culture lead people involved with political campaigns to use technologies from across platforms and domains in ways that leave them--and democracy--vulnerable to security attacks. Sensitive data was kept in a plethora of personal and work accounts, with ad hoc adoption of strong passwords, two-factor authentication, encryption, and access controls. No individual company, committee, organization, campaign, or academic institution can solve the identified problems on their own. To this end, we provide an initial understanding of this complex problem space and recommendations for how a diverse group of experts can begin working together to improve security for political campaigns.",

        "abstract": "To enable safe and reliable decision-making, autonomous vehicles (AVs) feed sensor data to perception algorithms to understand the environment. Sensor fusion with multi-frame tracking is becoming increasingly popular for detecting 3D objects. Thus, in this work, we perform an analysis of camera-LiDAR fusion, in the AV context, under LiDAR spoofing attacks. Recently, LiDAR-only perception was shown vulnerable to LiDAR spoofing attacks; however, we demonstrate these attacks are not capable of disrupting camera-LiDAR fusion. We then define a novel, context-aware attack: frustum attack, and show that out of 8 widely used perception algorithms - across 3 architectures of LiDAR-only and 3 architectures of camera-LiDAR fusion - all are significantly vulnerable to the frustum attack. In addition, we demonstrate that the frustum attack is stealthy to existing defenses against LiDAR spoofing as it preserves consistencies between camera and LiDAR semantics. Finally, we show that the frustum attack can be exercised consistently over time to form stealthy longitudinal attack sequences, compromising the tracking module and creating adverse outcomes on end-to-end AV control.",

        "abstract": "Encryption of secret data prevents an adversary from learning sensitive information by observing the transferred data. Even though the data itself is encrypted, however, an attacker can watch which locations of the memory, disk, and network are accessed and infer a signi\ufb01cant amount of secret information. To defend attacks based on this access pattern leakage, a number of oblivious algorithms have been devised. These algorithms transform the access pattern in a way that the access sequences are independent of the secret input data. Since oblivious algorithms tend to be slow, a go-to optimization for algorithm designers is to leverage space unobservable to the attacker . However, one can easily miss a subtle detail and violate the oblivious property in the process of doing so. In this paper, we propose ObliCheck, a checker verifying whether a given algorithm is indeed oblivious. In contrast to existing checkers, ObliCheck distinguishes observable and unobservable state of an algorithm. It employs symbolic execution to check whether all execution paths exhibit the same observable behavior. To achieve accuracy and ef\ufb01ciency, ObliCheck introduces two key techniques: Optimistic State Merging to quickly check if the algorithm is oblivious, and Iterative State Unmerging to iteratively re\ufb01ne its judgment if the algorithm is reported as not oblivious. ObliCheck achieves \u00d7 4850 of performance improvement over conventional symbolic execution without sacri\ufb01cing accuracy.",

In response, OSNs often deploy abusive account classi\ufb01ers using machine learning (ML) approaches. However, a practical, effective ML-based defense requires carefully engineering features that are robust to adversarial manipulation, obtaining enough ground truth labeled data for model training, and designing a system that can scale to all active accounts on an OSN (potentially in the billions). To address these challenges we present Deep Entity Classi\ufb01-cation (DEC) , an ML framework that detects abusive accounts in OSNs that have evaded other, traditional abuse detection systems. We leverage the insight that while accounts in isolation may be dif\ufb01cult to classify, their embeddings in the social graph\u2014the network structure, properties, and behaviors of themselves and those around them\u2014are fundamentally dif-\ufb01cult for attackers to replicate or manipulate at scale .

Techniques using differential privacy have been proposed to address this, but bring their own challenges -- many require a trusted third party or else add too much noise to produce useful models. Recent advances in \\emph{secure aggregation} using multiparty computation eliminate the need for a third party, but are computationally expensive especially at scale. We present a new federated learning protocol that leverages a novel differentially private, malicious secure aggregation protocol based on techniques from Learning With Errors. Our protocol outperforms current state-of-the art techniques, and empirical results show that it scales to a large number of parties, with optimal accuracy for any differentially private federated learning scheme.",

        "abstract": "The mitigation action against a malicious website may differ greatly depending on how that site is hosted. If it is hosted under a private apex domain, where all its subdomains and pages are under the apex domain owner\u2019s direct control, we could block at the apex domain level. If it is hosted under a public apex domain though (e.g., a web hosting service provider), it would be more appropriate to block at the subdo-main level. Further, for the former case, the private apex domain may be legitimate but compromised, or may be attacker-generated, which, again, would warrant different mitigation actions: attacker-owned apex domains could be blocked permanently, while only temporarily for compromised ones. In this paper, we study over eight hundred million Virus-Total (VT) URL scans from Aug. 1, 2019 to Nov. 18, 2019 and build the \ufb01rst content agnostic machine learning models to distinguish between the above mentioned different types of apex domains hosting malicious websites. Speci\ufb01cally, we \ufb01rst build a highly accurate model to distinguish between public and private apex domains. Then we build additional models to further distinguish compromised domains from attacker-owned ones. Utilizing our trained models, we conduct a large-scale study of the host domains of malicious websites . We observe that even though public apex domains are less than 1% of the apexes hosting malicious websites, they amount to a whopping 46.5% malicious web pages seen in VT URL feeds during our study period. 19.5% of these public malicious websites are compromised.",

        "abstract": "Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have seen a rapid proliferation in the last decade ampli\ufb01ed by the advent of the 4th Industrial Revolution. At the same time, several notable cyber-security incidents in industrial environments have underlined the lack of depth in security evaluation of industrial devices such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC). Modern PLCs are based on widely used microprocessors and deploy commodity operating systems (e.g., ARM on Linux). Thus, threats from the information technology domain can be readily ported to industrial environments. PLC application bi-naries in particular have never been considered as regular programs able to introduce traditional security threats, such as buffer over\ufb02ows. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of exploiting PLC binaries as well as their surrounding PLC-speci\ufb01c environment. We examine binaries produced by all available IEC 61131-3 control system programming languages for compilation-based differences and introduced vulnerabilities. Driven by this analysis, we develop a fuzzing framework to perform security evaluation of the PLC binaries along with the host functions they interact with. Fuzzing such non-executable binaries is non-trivial, as they operate with real-time constraints and receive their inputs from peripherals. To prove the correctness of our fuzzing tool, we use a database of in-house developed binaries in addition to functional control applications collected from online repositories. We showcase the ef\ufb01cacy of our technique by demonstrating uncovered vulnerabilities in both control application binaries and their runtime system. Furthermore, we demonstrate an exploitation methodology for an in-house as well as a regular control binary, based on the uncovered vulnerabilities.",

        "title": "ATLAS: A Sequence-based Learning Approach for Attack Investigation",
        "abstract": "Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) involve multiple attack steps over a long period, and their investigation requires analysis of myriad logs to identify their attack steps, which are a set of activities undertaken to run an APT attack. However, on a daily basis in an enterprise, intrusion detection systems generate many threat alerts of suspicious events (attack symptoms). Cyber analysts must investigate such events to determine whether an event is a part of an attack. With many alerts to investigate, cyber analysts often end up with alert fatigue, causing them to ignore a large number of alerts and miss true attack events. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a framework that constructs an end-to-end attack story from off-the-shelf audit logs. Our key observation is that different attacks may share similar abstract attack strategies, regardless of the vulnerabilities exploited and payloads executed. ATLAS leverages a novel combination of causality analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques to build a sequence-based model, which establishes key patterns of attack and non-attack behaviors from a causal graph. At inference time, given a threat alert event, an attack symptom node in a causal graph is identified. ATLAS then constructs a set of candidate sequences associated with the symptom node, uses the sequence-based model to identify nodes in a sequence that contribute to the attack, and unifies the identified attack nodes to construct an attack story. We evaluated ATLAS with ten real-world APT attacks executed in a realistic virtual environment. ATLAS recovers attack steps and construct attack stories with an average of 91.06% precision, 97.29% recall, and 93.76% F1-score. Through this effort, we provide security investigators with a new means of identifying the attack events that make up the attack story. \u2217 The authors contributed equally.",

In this paper, we performed the \ufb01rst measurement study on real-world Dapp attack instances to recover critical threat intelligence (e.g., kill chain and attack patterns). Utilizing such threat intelligence, we proposed the \ufb01rst technique DE-FIER to automatically investigate attack incidents on a large scale. Running DEFIER on 2.3 million transactions from 104 Ethereum on-chain Dapps, we were able to identify 476,342 exploit transactions on 85 target Dapps, which related to 75 0-day victim Dapps and 17K previously-unknown attacker EOAs. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest Ethereum on-chain Dapp attack incidents dataset ever reported.",

        "abstract": "Miscreants from online underground economies regularly exploit website vulnerabilities and inject fraudulent content into victim web pages to promote illicit goods and services. Scalable detection of such promotional website defacements remains an open problem despite their prevalence in Black Hat Search Engine Optimization (SEO) campaigns. Adver-saries often manage to inject content in a stealthy manner by obfuscating the description of illicit products and/or the presence of defacements to make them undetectable. In this paper, we design and implement DM O S - a Defacement Monitoring System which protects websites from promotional defacements at scale. Our design is based on two key observations: Firstly, for effective advertising, the obfuscated jargons of illicit goods or services need to be easily understood by their target customers ( e.g. , sharing similar shape or pronunciation). Secondly, to promote the underground business, the defacements are crafted to boost search engine ranking of the defaced web pages while trying to stay stealthy from the maintainers and legitimate users of the compromised websites. Leveraging these insights, we \ufb01rst follow the human convention and design a jargon normalization algorithm to map obfuscated jargons to their original forms. We then develop a tag embedding mechanism, which enables DM O S to focus more on those not-so-visually-obvious, yet site-ranking in\ufb02u-ential HTML tags ( e.g. , title , meta ). Consequently, DM O S can reliably detect illicit content hidden in compromised web pages. In particular, we have deployed DM O S as a cloud-based monitoring service for a \ufb01ve-month trial run. It has analyzed more than 38 million web pages across 7000+ commercial Chinese websites and found defacements in 11% of these websites. It achieves a",

        "abstract": "Adversarial examples seem to be inevitable. These specifically crafted inputs allow attackers to arbitrarily manipulate machine learning systems. Even worse, they often seem harmless to human observers. In our digital society, this poses a significant threat. For example, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, which serve as hands-free interfaces to many kinds of systems, can be attacked with inputs incomprehensible for human listeners. The research community has unsuccessfully tried several approaches to tackle this problem. In this paper we propose a different perspective: We accept the presence of adversarial examples against ASR systems, but we require them to be perceivable by human listeners. By applying the principles of psychoacoustics, we can remove semantically irrelevant information from the ASR input and train a model that resembles human perception more closely. We implement our idea in a tool named DOMPTEUR and demonstrate that our augmented system, in contrast to an unmodified baseline, successfully focuses on perceptible ranges of the input signal. This change forces adversarial examples into the audible range, while using minimal computational overhead and preserving benign performance. To evaluate our approach, we construct an adaptive attacker that actively tries to avoid our augmentations and demonstrate that adversarial examples from this attacker remain clearly perceivable. Finally, we substantiate our claims by performing a hearing test with crowd-sourced human listeners.",

This paper presents JAW, a framework that enables the analysis of modern web applications against client-side CSRF leveraging declarative traversals on hybrid property graphs , a canonical, hybrid model for JavaScript programs. We use JAW to evaluate the prevalence of client-side CSRF vulnerabilities among all (i.e., 106) web applications from the Bitnami catalog, covering over 228M lines of JavaScript code. Our approach uncovers 12,701 forgeable client-side requests affecting 87 web applications in total. For 203 forgeable requests, we successfully created client-side CSRF exploits against seven web applications that can execute arbitrary server-side state-changing operations or enable cross-site scripting and SQL injection, that are not reachable via the classical attack vectors. Finally, we analyzed the forgeable requests and iden-ti\ufb01ed 25 request templates, highlighting the \ufb01elds that can be manipulated and the type of manipulation.",

This new technology, called WebVR, enables virtual reality by rendering a three-dimensional world on an HTML canvas. Unfortunately, there exists no browser-supported way of sharing this canvas between different parties.

Our user study demonstrates that the success rates of our attacks range from 88.23% to 100%, con\ufb01rming their effectiveness. To mitigate the presented threats, we propose AdCube, which allows publishers to specify the behaviors of third-party ad code and enforce this speci\ufb01cation.

        "abstract": "Evidence-based elections aim to produce trustworthy and compelling evidence of the correctness of election outcomes, enabling the detection of problems with high probability. They require a well-curated voter-veri\ufb01ed paper trail, compliance audits, and a rigorous tabulation audit of the election outcome, known as a risk-limiting audit (RLA). This paper focuses on ballot polling RLAs which can require that a very large sample of ballots be drawn. The main ballot polling RLA in use today, BRAVO, is designed for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot draw. But in practice, ballot polling audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop. Direct application of B RAVO to large rounds results in considerable inef\ufb01ciency. We present M INERVA , a risk-limiting audit that addresses this problem. When compared to the B RAVO stopping rule being applied at the end of the round, for a \ufb01rst-round with 90% stopping probability, M INERVA halves the number of ballots required across all state margins in the 2020 US Presidential election. When compared to the B RAVO stopping rule being applied after examination of individual ballots, M INERVA reduces the number of ballots by about a quarter. M INERVA requires that round sizes are predetermined; this does not appear to be a drawback for large \ufb01rst rounds which have been typical choices for election of\ufb01cials. Ballot-polling audits are the leading option in most states. M INERVA",

        "title": "ML-Doctor: Holistic Risk Assessment of Inference Attacks Against Machine Learning Models",
        "abstract": "Inference attacks against Machine Learning (ML) models allow adversaries to learn sensitive information about training data, model parameters, etc. While researchers have studied, in depth, several kinds of attacks, they have done so in isolation. As a result, we lack a comprehensive picture of the risks caused by the attacks, e.g., the different scenarios they can be applied to, the common factors that influence their performance, the relationship among them, or the effectiveness of possible defenses. In this paper, we fill this gap by presenting a first-of-its-kind holistic risk assessment of different inference attacks against machine learning models. We concentrate on four attacks -- namely, membership inference, model inversion, attribute inference, and model stealing -- and establish a threat model taxonomy. Our extensive experimental evaluation, run on five model architectures and four image datasets, shows that the complexity of the training dataset plays an important role with respect to the attack's performance, while the effectiveness of model stealing and membership inference attacks are negatively correlated. We also show that defenses like DP-SGD and Knowledge Distillation can only mitigate some of the inference attacks. Our analysis relies on a modular re-usable software, ML-Doctor, which enables ML model owners to assess the risks of deploying their models, and equally serves as a benchmark tool for researchers and practitioners.",

The predominant approach at present, perceptual hash matching, is not viable because in E2EE a communications service cannot access user content. In this work, we explore the technical feasibility of privacy-preserving perceptual hash matching for E2EE services. We begin by formalizing the problem space and identifying fundamental limitations for protocols. Next, we evaluate the predictive performance of common perceptual hash functions to understand privacy risks to E2EE users and contextualize errors associated with the protocols we design. Our primary contribution is a set of constructions for privacy-preserving perceptual hash matching. We design and evaluate client-side constructions for scenarios where disclosing the set of harmful hashes is acceptable. We then design and evaluate interactive protocols that optionally protect the hash set and do not disclose matches to users. The constructions that we propose are practical for deployment on mobile devices and introduce a limited additional risk of false negatives.",

        "abstract": "A kernel data race is notoriously challenging to detect, re-produce, and diagnose, mainly caused by nondeterministic thread interleaving. The kernel data race has a critical security implication since it often leads to memory corruption, which can be abused to launch privilege escalation attacks. Interestingly, due to the challenges above, the exploitation of the kernel data race is also challenging. Specifically, we find that some kernel races are nearly impossible to exploit due to their unique requirement on execution orders, which are almost impossible to happen without manual intervention. This paper develops a generic exploitation technique for kernel data races. To this end, we first analyze kernel data races, which finds an intrinsic condition classifying easy-to-exploit and hard-to-exploit races. Then we develop E XP R ACE , a generic race exploitation technique for modern kernels, including Linux, Microsoft Windows, and MAC OS X. E XP R ACE turns hard-to-exploit races into easy-to-exploit races by manipulating an interrupt mechanism during the exploitation. According to our evaluation with 10 real-world hard-to-exploit races, E XP R ACE was able to exploit all of those within 10 to 118 seconds, while an exploitation without E XP R ACE failed for all given 24 hours.",

        "abstract": "Touchscreen-based mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are used daily by billions of people for productivity and entertainment. This paper uncovers a new security threat posed by a side-channel leakage through the power line, called Charger-Sur\ufb01ng, which targets these touchscreen devices. We reveal that while a smartphone is charging, its power trace, which can be measured via the USB charging cable, leaks information about the dynamic content on its screen. This information can be utilized to determine the location on the touchscreen where an animation is played by the mobile OS to indicate, for instance, that a button press has been registered. We develop a portable, low cost power trace collection system for the side-channel construction. This leakage channel is thoroughly evaluated on various smartphones running Android or iOS, equipped with the two most commonly used screen technologies (LCD and OLED). We validate the effectiveness of Charger-Sur\ufb01ng by conducting a case study on a passcode unlock screen. Our experiments show that an adversary can exploit Charger-Sur\ufb01ng across a wide range of smartphone models to achieve an average accuracy of 98.7% for single button inference, and an average of 95.1% or 92.8% accuracy on the \ufb01rst attempt when cracking a victim\u2019s 4-digit or 6-digit passcode, respectively. The inference accuracy increases to 99.3% (4-digit) or 96.9% (6-digit) within \ufb01ve trials. We further demonstrate the robustness of Charger-Sur\ufb01ng in realistic settings and discuss countermeasures against it.",

        "abstract": "We tackle the challenge of reliably determining the geo-location of nodes in decentralized networks, considering adversarial settings and without depending on any trusted landmarks. In particular, we consider active adversaries that control a subset of nodes, announce false locations and strategically manipulate measurements. To address this problem we propose, implement and evaluate VerLoc, a system that allows verifying the claimed geo-locations of network nodes in a fully decentralized manner. VerLoc securely schedules roundtrip time (RTT) measurements between randomly chosen pairs of nodes. Trilateration is then applied to the set of measurements to verify claimed geo-locations. We evaluate VerLoc both with simulations and in the wild using a prototype implementation integrated in the Nym network (currently run by thousands of nodes). We find that VerLoc can localize nodes in the wild with a median error of 60 km, and that in attack simulations it is capable of detecting and filtering out adversarial timing manipulations for network setups with up to 20 % malicious nodes.",

        "abstract": "Compacting garbage collection ( compact-gc ) is a method that improves memory utilization and reduces memory fragmentation by rearranging live objects and updating their references using an address table. A critical use-after-free bug may exist if an object reference that is not registered in the address table is used after compact-gc , as the live object may be moved but the reference will not be updated after compact-gc . We refer to this as a use-after-compact-gc ( use-after-cgc ) bug. Prior tools have attempted to statically detect these bugs with target-speci\ufb01c heuristics. However, due to their path-insensitive analysis and imprecise target-speci\ufb01c heuristics, they have high false-positives and false-negatives. In this paper, we present a precise and scalable static analyzer, named CGSan, for \ufb01nding use-after-cgc bugs. CGSan detects use-after-cgc bug candidates by intra-procedural static symbolic taint analysis and checks their feasibility by under-constrained directed symbolic execution. To mitigate the in-completeness of intra-procedural analysis, we employ a type-based taint policy. For scalability, we propose using directed inter-procedural control-\ufb02ow graphs, which reduce search spaces by excluding paths irrelevant to checking feasibility, and directed scheduling, which prioritizes paths to quickly check feasibility. We evaluated CGSan on Google V8 and Mozilla SpiderMonkey, and we found 13 unique use-after-cgc bugs with only 2 false-positives while two prior tools missed 10 bugs and had 34 false-positives in total.",

We implemented a prototype of M AZE based on the analysis engine S2E, and evaluated it on the PHP, Python and Perl interpreters and a set of CTF (capture the \ufb02ag) programs, as well as a large micro-benchmark.

        "abstract": "In successful enterprise attacks, adversaries often need to gain access to additional machines beyond their initial point of compromise, a set of internal movements known as lateral movement. We present Hopper, a system for detecting lateral movement based on commonly available enterprise logs. Hopper constructs a graph of login activity among internal machines and then identifies suspicious sequences of loginsthat correspond to lateral movement. To understand the larger context of each login, Hopper employs an inference algorithm to identify the broader path(s) of movement that each login belongs to and the causal user responsible for performing a path's logins. Hopper then leverages this path inference algorithm, in conjunction with a set of detection rules and a new anomaly scoring algorithm, to surface the login paths most likely to reflect lateral movement. On a 15-month enterprise dataset consisting of over 780 million internal logins, Hop-per achieves a 94.5% detection rate across over 300 realistic attack scenarios, including one red team attack, while generating an average of<9 alerts per day. In contrast, to detect the same number of attacks, prior state-of-the-art systems would need to generate nearly 8x as many false positives.",

        "abstract": "IoT devices have brought invaluable convenience to our daily life. However, their pervasiveness also amplifies the impact of security vulnerabilities. Many popular vulnerabilities of embedded systems reside in their vulnerable web services. Unfortunately, existing vulnerability detection methods cannot effectively nor efficiently analyze such web services: they either introduce heavy execution overheads or have many false positives and false negatives. In this paper, we propose a novel static taint checking solution, SaTC, to effectively detect security vulnerabilities in web services provided by embedded devices. Our key insight is that, string literals on web interfaces are commonly shared between front-end files and back-end binaries to encode user input. We thus extract such common keywords from the frontend, and use them to locate reference points in the back-end, which indicate the input entry. Then, we apply targeted dataflow analysis to accurately detect dangerous uses of the untrusted user input. We implemented a prototype of SaTC and evaluated it on 39 embedded system firmwares from six popular vendors. SaTC discovered 33 unknown bugs, of which 30 are confirmed by CVE/CNVD/PSV. Compared to the state-ofthe-art tool KARONTE, SaTC found significantly more bugs on the test set. It shows that, SaTC is effective in discovering bugs in embedded systems.",

        "title": "Breaking Through Binaries: Compiler-quality Instrumentation for Better Binary-only Fuzzing",
        "abstract": "Coverage-guided fuzzing is one of the most effective software security testing techniques. Fuzzing takes on one of two forms: compiler-based or binary-only, depending on the availability of source code. While the fuzzing community has improved compiler-based fuzzing with performanceand feedback-enhancing program transformations, binaryonly fuzzing lags behind due to the semantic and performance limitations of instrumenting code at the binary level. Many fuzzing use cases are binary-only (i.e., closed source). Thus, applying fuzzing-enhancing program transformations to binary-only fuzzing\u2014without sacrificing performance\u2014 remains a compelling challenge. This paper examines the properties required to achieve compiler-quality binary-only fuzzing instrumentation. Based on our findings, we design FIBRE: a platform for applying fuzzing-enhancing program transformation to binary-only targets\u2014maintaining compiler-level performance. We showcase FIBRE\u2019s capabilities in an implementation for the popular fuzzer AFL, including five compiler-style fuzzing-enhancing transformations, and evaluate it against the leading binaryonly fuzzing instrumenters AFL-QEMU and AFL-Dyninst. Across LAVA-M and real-world targets, FIBRE improves crash-finding by 26\u201396% and 37\u2013131%; and throughput by 48\u201378% and 159\u2013203% compared to AFL-Dyninst and AFLQEMU, respectively\u2014while maintaining compiler-level of overhead of 27%. We also show that FIBRE supports realworld openand closed-source software of varying size (10K\u2013 100MB), complexity (100\u20131M basic blocks), platform (Linux and Windows), and format (e.g., stripped and PIC).",

        "abstract": "Hypervisors are widely deployed by cloud computing providers to support virtual machines, but their growing complexity poses a security risk, as large codebases contain many vulnerabilities. We present SeKVM, a layered Linux KVM hypervisor architecture that has been formally verified on multiprocessor hardware. Using layers, we isolate KVM\u2019s trusted computing base into a small core such that only the core needs to be verified to ensure KVM\u2019s security guarantees. Using layers, we model hardware features at different levels of abstraction tailored to each layer of software. Lower hypervisor layers that configure and control hardware are verified using a novel machine model that includes multiprocessor memory management hardware such as multi-level shared page tables, tagged TLBs, and a coherent cache hierarchy with cache bypass support. Higher hypervisor layers that build on the lower layers are then verified using a more abstract and simplified model, taking advantage of layer encapsulation to reduce proof burden. Furthermore, layers provide modularity to reduce verification effort across multiple implementation versions. We have retrofitted and verified multiple versions of KVM on Arm multiprocessor hardware, proving the correctness of the implementations and that they contain no vulnerabilities that can affect KVM\u2019s security guarantees. Our work is the first machine-checked proof for a commodity hypervisor using multiprocessor memory management hardware. SeKVM requires only modest KVM modifications and incurs only modest performance overhead versus unmodified KVM on real application workloads.",

        "title": "Double-Cross Attacks: Subverting Active Learning Systems",
        "abstract": "Active learning is widely used in data labeling services to support real-world machine learning applications. By selecting and labeling the samples that have the highest impact on model retraining, active learning can reduce labeling efforts, and thus reduce cost. In this paper, we present a novel attack called Double Cross , which aims to manipulate data labeling and model training in active learning settings. To perform a double-cross attack, the adversary crafts inputs with a special trigger pattern and sends the triggered inputs to the victim model retraining pipeline. The goals of the triggered inputs are (1) to get selected for labeling and retraining by the victim; (2) to subsequently mis-lead human annotators into assigning an adversary-selected label; and (3) to change the victim model\u2019s behavior after retraining occurs. After retraining, the attack causes the victim to mislabel any samples with this trigger pattern to the adversary-chosen label. At the same time, labeling other samples, without the trigger pattern, is not affected. We develop a trigger generation method that simultaneously achieves these three goals. We evaluate the attack on multiple existing image classi\ufb01ers and demonstrate that both gray-box and black-box attacks are successful. Furthermore, we perform experiments on a real-world machine learning platform (Amazon Sage-Maker) to evaluate the attack with human annotators in the loop, to con\ufb01rm the practicality of the attack. Finally, we discuss the implications of the results and the open research questions moving forward.",

        "abstract": "Accessibility features of Android are crucial in assisting people with disabilities or impairment to navigate their devices. However, the same, powerful features are commonly misused by shady apps for malevolent purposes, such as stealing data from other apps. Unfortunately, existing defenses do not allow apps to protect themselves and at the same time to be fully inclusive to users with accessibility needs. \nTo enhance the privacy protection of the user while preserving the accessibility features for assistive apps, we introduce an extension to Android\u2019s accessibility framework. Our design is based on a study of how accessibility features are used in 95 existing accessibility apps of different types (malware, utility, and a11y). Based on those insights, we propose to model the usage of the accessibility framework as a pipeline of code modules, which are all sandboxed on the system-side. By policing the data flows of those modules, we achieve a more fine-grained control over the access to accessibility features and the way they are used in apps, allowing a balance between accessibility functionality for dependent users and reduced privacy risks. We demonstrate the feasibility of our solution by migrating two real-world apps to our privacy-enhanced accessibility framework.",

        "abstract": "Spectre v1 attacks, which exploit conditional branch misprediction, are often identified with attacks that bypass array bounds checking to leak data from a victim's memory. Generally, however, Spectre v1 attacks can exploit any conditional branch misprediction that makes the victim execute code incorrectly. In this paper, we investigate speculative type confusion, a Spectre v1 attack vector in which branch mispredictions make the victim execute with variables holding values of the wrong type and thereby leak memory content. We observe that speculative type confusion can be inadvertently introduced by a compiler, making it extremely hard for programmers to reason about security and manually apply Spectre mitigations. We thus set out to determine the extent to which speculative type confusion affects the Linux kernel. Our analysis finds exploitable and potentially-exploitable arbitrary memory disclosure vulnerabilities. We also find many latent vulnerabilities, which could become exploitable due to innocuous system changes, such as coding style changes. Our results suggest that Spectre mitigations which rely on statically/manually identifying\"bad\"code patterns need to be rethought, and more comprehensive mitigations are needed.",

        "abstract": "TLS clients rely on a supporting PKI in which certi\ufb01cate authorities (CAs)\u2014trusted organizations\u2014validate and cryptographically attest to the identities of web servers. A client\u2019s con\ufb01dence that it is connecting to the right server depends entirely on the set of CAs that it trusts. However, as we demonstrate in this work, the identity speci\ufb01ed in CA certi\ufb01cates is frequently inaccurate due to lax naming requirements, ownership changes, and long-lived certi\ufb01cates. This not only mud-dles client selection of trusted CAs, but also prevents PKI operators and researchers from correctly attributing CA certi\ufb01cate issues to CA organizations. To help Web PKI participants understand the organizations that control each CA certi\ufb01cate, we develop Fides, a system that models and clusters CA operational behavior in order to detect CA certi\ufb01cates under shared operational control. We label the clusters that Fides uncovers, and build a new database of CA ownership that corrects the CA operator for 241 CA certi\ufb01cates, and expands coverage to 651 new CA certi\ufb01cates, leading to a more complete picture of CA certi\ufb01cate control.",

        "title": "Abusing Hidden Properties to Attack the Node.js Ecosystem",
        "abstract": "Nowadays, Node.js has been widely used in the development of server-side and desktop programs (e.g., Skype), with its cross-platform and high-performance execution environment of JavaScript. In past years, it has been reported other dynamic programming languages (e.g., PHP and Ruby) are unsafe on sharing objects. However, this security risk is not well studied and understood in JavaScript and Node.js programs. In this paper, we \ufb01ll the gap by conducting the \ufb01rst systematic study on the communication process between client-and server-side code in Node.js programs. We extensively identify several new vulnerabilities in popular Node.js programs. To demonstrate their security implications, we design and develop a novel feasible attack, named hidden property abusing (HPA). Our further analysis shows HPA attacks are subtly different from existing \ufb01ndings regarding exploitation and attack effects. Through HPA attacks, a remote web attacker may obtain dangerous abilities, such as stealing con\ufb01dential data, bypassing security checks, and launching DoS (Denial of Service) attacks. To help Node.js developers vet their programs against HPA, we design a novel vulnerability detection and veri\ufb01cation tool, named L YNX , that utilizes hybrid program analysis to automatically reveal HPA vulnerabilities and even synthesize exploits. We apply L YNX on a set of widely-used Node.js programs and identify 15 previously unknown vulnerabilities. We have reported all of our \ufb01ndings to the Node.js community. 10 of them have been assigned with CVE, and 8 of them are rated as \u201cCritical\u201d or \u201cHigh\u201d severity. This indicates HPA attacks can cause serious security threats.",

        "abstract": "The GPS has empowered billions of users and various critical infrastructures with its positioning and time services. However, GPS spoo\ufb01ng attacks also become a growing threat to GPS-dependent systems. Existing detection methods either require expensive hardware modi\ufb01cations to current GPS devices or lack the basic robustness against sophisticated attacks, hurting their adoption and usage in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel GPS spoo\ufb01ng detection framework that works with off-the-shelf GPS chipsets. Our basic idea is to rotate a one-side-blocked GPS receiver to derive the angle-of-arrival (AoAs) of received signals and compare them with the GPS constellation (consists of tens of GPS satellites). We \ufb01rst demonstrate the effectiveness of this idea by implementing a smartphone prototype and evaluating it against a real spoofer in various \ufb01eld experiments (in both open air and urban canyon environments). Our method achieves a high accuracy (95%\u2013100%) in 5 seconds. Then we implement an adaptive attack, assuming the attacker becomes aware of our defense method and actively modulates the spoo\ufb01ng signals accordingly. We study this adaptive attack and propose enhancement methods (using the rotation speed as the \u201csecret key\u201d) to fortify the defense. Further experiments are conducted",

        "abstract": "As IoT devices are integrated via automation and coupled with the physical environment, anomalies in an appified smart home, whether due to attacks or device malfunctions, may lead to severe consequences. Priorworks that utilize data mining techniques to detect anomalies suffer from high false alarm rates and missing many real anomalies. Our observation is that data mining-based approaches miss a large chunk of information about automation programs (also called smart apps ) and devices. We propose Home Automation Watcher (HAWatcher), a semantics-aware anomaly detection system for appified smart homes. HAWatcher models a smart home\u2019s normal behaviors based on both event logs and semantics. Given a home, HAWatcher generates hypothetical correlations according to semantic information, such as apps, device types, relations and installation locations, and verifies them with event logs. The mined correlations are refined using correlations extracted from the installed smart apps. The refined correlations are used by a Shadow Execution engine to simulate the smart home\u2019s normal behaviors. During run-time, inconsistencies between devices\u2019 real-world states and simulated states are reported as anomalies. We evaluate our prototype on the SmartThings platform in four real-world testbeds and test it against totally 62 different anomaly cases. The results show that HAWatcher achieves high accuracy, significantly outperforming prior approaches.",

This attack exploits subtleties in text-encoding standards such as Unicode to produce source code whose tokens are logically encoded in a different order from the one in which they are displayed, leading to vulnerabilities that cannot be perceived directly by human code reviewers. 'Trojan Source' attacks, as we call them, pose an immediate threat both to first-party software and of supply-chain compromise across the industry. We present working examples of Trojan Source attacks in C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Go, Python, SQL, Bash, Assembly, and Solidity. We propose definitive compiler-level defenses, and describe other mitigating controls that can be deployed in editors, repositories, and build pipelines while compilers are upgraded to block this attack. We document an industry-wide coordinated disclosure for these vulnerabilities; as they affect most compilers, editors, and repositories, the exercise teaches how different firms, open-source communities, and other stakeholders respond to vulnerability disclosure.",

        "abstract": "We introduce the first microarchitectural side channel attacks that leverage contention on the CPU ring interconnect. There are two challenges that make it uniquely difficult to exploit this channel. First, little is known about the ring interconnect's functioning and architecture. Second, information that can be learned by an attacker through ring contention is noisy by nature and has coarse spatial granularity. To address the first challenge, we perform a thorough reverse engineering of the sophisticated protocols that handle communication on the ring interconnect. With this knowledge, we build a cross-core covert channel over the ring interconnect with a capacity of over 4 Mbps from a single thread, the largest to date for a cross-core channel not relying on shared memory. To address the second challenge, we leverage the fine-grained temporal patterns of ring contention to infer a victim program's secrets. We demonstrate our attack by extracting key bits from vulnerable EdDSA and RSA implementations, as well as inferring the precise timing of keystrokes typed by a victim user.",

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are commonly used for various traf\ufb01c analysis problems, such as website \ufb01ngerprinting and \ufb02ow correlation, as they outperform traditional (e.g., statistical) techniques by large margins. However, deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples: adversarial inputs to the model that get labeled incorrectly by the model due to small adversarial perturbations. In this paper, for the \ufb01rst time, we show that an adversary can defeat DNN-based traf\ufb01c analysis techniques by applying adversarial perturbations on the patterns of live network traf\ufb01c. Applying adversarial perturbations (examples) on traf\ufb01c analysis classi\ufb01ers faces two major challenges. First, the per-turbing party (i.e., the adversary) should be able to apply the adversarial network perturbations on live traf\ufb01c, with no need to buffering traf\ufb01c or having some prior knowledge about up-coming network packets. We design a systematic approach to create adversarial perturbations that are independent of their target network connections, and therefore can be applied in real-time on live traf\ufb01c. We therefore call such adversarial perturbations blind . Second, unlike image",

        "abstract": "Autonomous driving is developing rapidly and has achieved promising performance by adopting machine learning algorithms to finish various tasks automatically. Lane detection is one of the major tasks because its result directly affects the steering decisions. Although recent studies have discovered some vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicles, to the best of our knowledge, none has investigated the security of lane detection module in real vehicles. In this paper, we conduct the first investigation on the lane detection module in a real vehicle, and reveal that the over-sensitivity of the target module can be exploited to launch attacks on the vehicle. More precisely, an over-sensitive lane detection module may regard small markings on the road surface, which are introduced by an adversary, as a valid lane and then drive the vehicle in the wrong direction. It is challenging to design such small road markings that should be perceived by the lane detection module but unnoticeable to the driver. Manual manipulation of the road markings to launch attacks on the lane detection module is very labor-intensive and error-prone. We propose a novel two-stage approach to automatically determine such road markings after tackling several technical challenges. Our approach first decides the optimal perturbations on the camera image and then maps them to road markings in physical world. We conduct extensive experiments on a Tesla Model S vehicle, and the experimental results show that the lane detection module can be deceived by very unobtrusive perturbations to create a lane, thus misleading the vehicle in auto-steer mode.",

        "abstract": "Protecting network protocols within an encrypted tunnel, using technologies such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), is increasingly important to millions of users needing solutions to evade censorship or protect their traf\ufb01c against in/on-path observers/attackers. In this paper, we present a series of attacks from two threat models: an attacker that can inject spoofed packets into the network stack of a VPN client (called client-side), and an attacker that can spoof packets on the Internet and send them to a VPN server (called server-side). In both cases, we assume that the attacker is in/on-path, and can count encrypted bytes or packets over time. In both threat models, we demonstrate attacks to infer the existence of, interfere with, or inject data into TCP connections forwarded through the encrypted VPN tunnel. In the server-side threat model, we also demonstrate an attack to hijack tunneled DNS queries and completely remove the protections of the VPN tunnel. For the attacks presented in this paper, we (1) assess their feasibility in terms of packet rates and timing; (2) test their applicability against a broad range of VPN technologies, types, and vendors; and (3) consider practical issues with respect to real-world attacks. We followed an ethical disclosure process for all attacks presented in this paper. Client-side attacks were addressed with two CVEs and partially mitigated by a series of updates from some operating system and VPN client vendors. Server-side attacks have not been addressed and are still feasible with all operating systems and VPN servers that we tested.",

        "title": "GForce: GPU-Friendly Oblivious and Rapid Neural Network Inference",
        "abstract": "Neural-network classification is getting more pervasive. It captures data of the subjects to be classified, e.g., appearance for facial recognition, which is personal and often sensitive. Oblivious inference protects the data privacy of both the query and the model. However, it is not as fast and as accurate as its plaintext counterpart. A recent cryptographic solution Delphi (Usenix Security 2020) strives for low latency by using GPU on linear layers and replacing some non-linear units in the model at a price of accuracy. It can handle a query on CIFAR100 with \u223c68% accuracy in 14s or \u223c66% accuracy in 2.6s. We propose GForce, tackling the latency issue from the root causes instead of approximating non-linear computations. With the SWALP training approach (ICML 2019), we propose stochastic rounding and truncation (SRT) layers, which fuse quantization with dequantization between non-linear and linear layers and free us from floating-point operations for efficiency. They also ensure high accuracy while working over the severely-finite cryptographic field. We further propose a suite of GPU-friendly secure online/offline protocols for common operations, including comparison and wrap-around handling, which benefit non-linear layers, including our SRT. With our two innovations, GForce supports VGG-16, attaining \u223c73% accuracy over CIFAR-100 for the first time, in 0.4s. Compared with the prior best non-approximated solution (Usenix Security 2018), GForce speeds up non-linear layers in VGG by >34\u00d7. Our techniques shed light on a new direction that utilizes GPU throughout the model to minimize latency.",

        "title": "Hand Me Your PIN! Inferring ATM PINs of Users Typing with a Covered Hand",
        "abstract": "Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) represent the most used system for withdrawing cash. The European Central Bank reported more than 11 billion cash withdrawals and loading/unloading transactions on the European ATMs in 2019. Although ATMs have undergone various technological evolutions, Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) are still the most common authentication method for these devices. Unfortunately, the PIN mechanism is vulnerable to shoulder-surfing attacks performed via hidden cameras installed near the ATM to catch the PIN pad. To overcome this problem, people get used to covering the typing hand with the other hand. While such users probably believe this behavior is safe enough to protect against mentioned attacks, there is no clear assessment of this countermeasure in the scientific literature. This paper proposes a novel attack to reconstruct PINs entered by victims covering the typing hand with the other hand. We consider the setting where the attacker can access an ATM PIN pad of the same brand/model as the target one. Afterward, the attacker uses that model to infer the digits pressed by the victim while entering the PIN. Our attack owes its success to a carefully selected deep learning architecture that can infer the PIN from the typing hand position and movements. We run a detailed experimental analysis including 58 users. With our approach, we can guess 30% of the 5-digit PINs within three attempts -- the ones usually allowed by ATM before blocking the card. We also conducted a survey with 78 users that managed to reach an accuracy of only 7.92% on average for the same setting. Finally, we evaluate a shielding countermeasure that proved to be rather inefficient unless the whole keypad is shielded.",

        "title": "Detecting Kernel Refcount Bugs with Two-Dimensional Consistency Checking",
        "abstract": "In the Linux kernel, reference counting (refcount) has become a default mechanism that manages resource objects. A refcount of a tracked object is incremented when a new reference is assigned and decremented when a reference becomes invalid. Since the kernel manages a large number of shared resources, refcount is prevalent. Due to the inherent complexity of the kernel and resource sharing, developers often fail to properly update refcounts, leading to refcount bugs. Researchers have shown that refcount bugs can cause critical security impacts like privilege escalation; however, the detection of refcount bugs remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose CID , a new mechanism that employs two-dimensional consistency checking to automatically detect refcount bugs. By checking if callers consistently use a refcount function, CID detects deviating cases as potential bugs; by checking how a caller uses a refcount function, CID infers the condition-aware rules for the function to correspondingly operate the refcount, and thus a violating case is a potential bug. More importantly, CID \u2019s consistency checking does not require complicated semantic understanding, inter-procedural data-\ufb02ow tracing, or refcount-operation reasoning. CID also features an automated mechanism that systematically identi\ufb01es refcount \ufb01elds and functions in the whole kernel. We implement CID and apply it to the Linux kernel. The tool found 44 new refcount bugs that may cause severe security issues, most of which have been con\ufb01rmed by the maintainers.",

        "title": "Rage Against the Machine Clear: A Systematic Analysis of Machine Clears and Their Implications for Transient Execution Attacks",
        "abstract": "Since the discovery of the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities, transient execution attacks have increasingly gained momentum. However, while the community has investigated several variants to trigger attacks during transient execution, much less attention has been devoted to the analysis of the root causes of transient execution itself. Most attack variants simply build on well-known root causes, such as branch misprediction and aborts of Intel TSX\u2014which are no longer supported on many recent processors. In this paper, we tackle the problem from a new perspective, closely examining the different root causes of transient execution rather than focusing on new attacks based on known transient windows. Our analysis speci\ufb01cally focuses on the class of transient execution based on machine clears (MC), reverse engineering previously unexplored root causes such as Floating Point MC, Self-Modifying Code MC, Memory Ordering MC, and Memory Disambiguation MC. We show these events not only originate new transient execution windows that widen the horizon for known attacks, but also yield entirely new attack primitives to inject transient values ( Floating Point Value Injection or FPVI ) and executing stale code ( Speculative Code Store Bypass or SCSB ). We present an end-to-end FPVI exploit on the latest Mozilla SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine with all the mitigations enabled, disclosing arbitrary memory in the browser through attacker-controlled and transiently-injected \ufb02oating-point results. We also pro-pose mitigations for both attack primitives and evaluate their performance impact. Finally, as a by-product of our analysis, we present a new root cause-based classi\ufb01cation of all known transient execution paths.",

However, the works following this approach tend to require a large amount of specimenstotraintheirmodels.

Instead, our technique learns from the very codebase on which the bug detection is performed, and therefore, obviates the need for the cumbersome task of gathering and cleansing training samples (e.g., buggy code of certain kinds). The key idea behind our technique is a novel two-step clustering process applied on a given codebase. This clustering process identi\ufb01es code snippets in a project that are functionally-similar yet appear in inconsistent forms. Such inconsistencies are found to cause a wide range of bugs, anything from missing checks to unsafe type conversions. Unlike previous works, our technique is generic and not speci\ufb01c to one type of inconsistency or bug. We prototyped our technique and evaluated it using 5 popular open source software, including QEMU and OpenSSL. With a minimal amount of manual analysis on the inconsistencies detected by our tool, we discovered 22 new unique bugs, despite the fact that many of these programs are constantly undergoing bug scans and new bugs in them are believed to be rare.",

        "abstract": "Two-factor authentication (2FA) is one of the primary mechanisms for defending end-user accounts against phishing and password reuse attacks. Unfortunately, getting users to adopt 2FA remains a dif\ufb01cult challenge. While prior work at the intersection of measurement and usability has examined how to persuade people to avoid dangerous behavior (e. g., clicking through TLS warnings), relatively little work has conducted measurements at industry scale about how to persuade people to adopt protective behaviors. In this work, we focus on improving end user security in the wild by examining whether (i) messaging that addresses users\u2019 motivations, mental models, and concerns about 2FA and (ii) UX design patterns found effective in other \ufb01elds can effectively improve 2FA adoption. To do so, we conduct a series of large-scale in-the-wild, controlled messaging experiments on Facebook, with an average of 622 , 419 participants per experiment. Based on our results, we distill a set of best-practice design patterns for most effectively encouraging protective behavior, in the context of promoting 2FA adoption. Finally, we suggest concrete directions for future work on encouraging digital security behavior through security prompts.",

        "abstract": "Neural network applications have become popular in both enterprise and personal settings. Network solutions are tuned meticulously for each task, and designs that can robustly resolve queries end up in high demand. As the commercial value of accurate and performant machine learning models increases, so too does the demand to protect neural architectures as confidential investments. We explore the vulnerability of neural networks deployed as black boxes across accelerated hardware through electromagnetic side channels. We examine the magnetic flux emanating from a graphics processing unit's power cable, as acquired by a cheap $3 induction sensor, and find that this signal betrays the detailed topology and hyperparameters of a black-box neural network model. The attack acquires the magnetic signal for one query with unknown input values, but known input dimensions. The network reconstruction is possible due to the modular layer sequence in which deep neural networks are evaluated. We find that each layer component's evaluation produces an identifiable magnetic signal signature, from which layer topology, width, function type, and sequence order can be inferred using a suitably trained classifier and a joint consistency optimization based on integer programming. We study the extent to which network specifications can be recovered, and consider metrics for comparing network similarity. We demonstrate the potential accuracy of this side channel attack in recovering the details for a broad range of network architectures, including random designs. We consider applications that may exploit this novel side channel exposure, such as adversarial transfer attacks. In response, we discuss countermeasures to protect against our method and other similar snooping techniques.",

        "abstract": "The DNS filtering apparatus of China's Great Firewall (GFW) has evolved considerably over the past two decades. However, most prior studies of China's DNS filtering were performed over short time periods, leading to unnoticed changes in the GFW's behavior. In this study, we introduce GFWatch, a large-scale, longitudinal measurement platform capable of testing hundreds of millions of domains daily, enabling continuous monitoring of the GFW's DNS filtering behavior. We present the results of running GFWatch over a nine-month period, during which we tested an average of 411M domains per day and detected a total of 311K domains censored by GFW's DNS filter. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest number of domains tested and censored domains discovered in the literature. We further reverse engineer regular expressions used by the GFW and find 41K innocuous domains that match these filters, resulting in overblocking of their content. We also observe bogus IPv6 and globally routable IPv4 addresses injected by the GFW, including addresses owned by US companies, such as Facebook, Dropbox, and Twitter. Using data from GFWatch, we studied the impact of GFW blocking on the global DNS system. We found 77K censored domains with DNS resource records polluted in popular public DNS resolvers, such as Google and Cloudflare. Finally, we propose strategies to detect poisoned responses that can (1) sanitize poisoned DNS records from the cache of public DNS resolvers, and (2) assist in the development of circumvention tools to bypass the GFW's DNS censorship.",

        "abstract": "Fuzzing has become one of the most effective bug finding approach for software. In recent years, 24*7 continuous fuzzing platforms have emerged to test critical pieces of software, e.g., Linux kernel. Though capable of discovering many bugs and providing reproducers (e.g., proof-of-concepts), a major problem is that they neglect a critical function that should have been built-in, i.e., evaluation of a bug's security impact. It is well-known that the lack of understanding of security impact can lead to delayed bug fixes as well as patch propagation. In this paper, we develop SyzScope, a system that can automatically uncover new\"high-risk\"impacts given a bug with seemingly\"low-risk\"impacts. From analyzing over a thousand low-risk bugs on syzbot, SyzScope successfully determined that 183 low-risk bugs (more than 15%) in fact contain high-risk impacts, e.g., control flow hijack and arbitrary memory write, some of which still do not have patches available yet.",

        "abstract": "Online social network (OSN) accounts are often more user-centric than other types of online accounts (e.g., email accounts) because they present a number of demographic attributes such as age, gender, location, and occupation. While these attributes allow for more meaningful online interactions, they can also be used by malicious parties to craft various types of abuse. To understand the effects of demographic attributes on attacker behavior in stolen social accounts, we devised a method to instrument and monitor such accounts. We then created, instrumented, and deployed more than 1000 Facebook accounts, and exposed them to criminals. Our re-sults con\ufb01rm that victim demographic traits indeed in\ufb02uence the way cybercriminals abuse their accounts. For example, we \ufb01nd that cybercriminals that access teen accounts write messages and posts more than the ones accessing adult accounts, and attackers that compromise male accounts perform disruptive activities such as changing some of their pro\ufb01le information more than the ones that access female accounts. This knowledge could potentially help online services develop new models to characterize benign and malicious activity across various demographic attributes, and thus automatically classify future activity.",

        "title": "Can Systems Explain Permissions Better? Understanding Users' Misperceptions under Smartphone Runtime Permission Model",
        "abstract": ". Abstract Current smartphone operating systems enable users to manage permissions according to their personal preferences with a runtime permission model. Nonetheless, the systems provide very limited information when requesting permissions, making it dif\ufb01cult for users to understand permissions\u2019 capabilities and potentially induced risks. In this paper, we \ufb01rst investigated to what extent current system-provided information can help users understand the scope of permissions and their potential risks. We took a mixed-methods approach by collecting real permission settings from 4,636 Android users, an interview study of 20 participants, and large-scale Internet surveys of 1559 users. Our study identi\ufb01ed several common misunderstandings on the runtime permission model among users. We found that only a very small percentage (6.1%) of users can infer the scope of permission groups accurately from the system-provided information. This indicates that the information provided by current systems is far from suf\ufb01cient. We thereby explored what extra information that systems can provide to help users make more informed permission decisions. By surveying users\u2019 common concerns on apps\u2019 permission requests, we identi\ufb01ed \ufb01ve types of information (i.e., decision factors) that are helpful for users\u2019 decisions. We further studied the impact and helpfulness of the factors to users\u2019 permission decisions with both positive and negative messages. Our study shows that the background access factor helps most while the grant rate helps the least. Based on the \ufb01ndings, we provide suggestions for system designers to enhance future systems with more permission information.",

        "title": "Osiris: Automated Discovery of Microarchitectural Side Channels",
        "abstract": "In the last years, a series of side channels have been discovered on CPUs. These side channels have been used in powerful attacks, e.g., on cryptographic implementations, or as building blocks in transient-execution attacks such as Spectre or Meltdown. However, in many cases, discovering side channels is still a tedious manual process. In this paper, we present Osiris, a fuzzing-based framework to automatically discover microarchitectural side channels. Based on a machine-readable specification of a CPU's ISA, Osiris generates instruction-sequence triples and automatically tests whether they form a timing-based side channel. Furthermore, Osiris evaluates their usability as a side channel in transient-execution attacks, i.e., as the microarchitectural encoding for attacks like Spectre. In total, we discover four novel timing-based side channels on Intel and AMD CPUs. Based on these side channels, we demonstrate exploitation in three case studies. We show that our microarchitectural KASLR break using non-temporal loads, FlushConflict, even works on the new Intel Ice Lake and Comet Lake microarchitectures. We present a cross-core cross-VM covert channel that is not relying on the memory subsystem and transmits up to 1 kbit/s. We demonstrate this channel on the AWS cloud, showing that it is stealthy and noise resistant. Finally, we demonstrate Stream+Reload, a covert channel for transient-execution attacks that, on average, allows leaking 7.83 bytes within a transient window, improving state-of-the-art attacks that only leak up to 3 bytes.",

        "title": "Teacher Model Fingerprinting Attacks Against Transfer Learning",
        "abstract": "Transfer learning has become a common solution to address training data scarcity in practice. It trains a specified student model by reusing or fine-tuning early layers of a well-trained teacher model that is usually publicly available. However, besides utility improvement, the transferred public knowledge also brings potential threats to model confidentiality, and even further raises other security and privacy issues. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation of the teacher model exposure threat in the transfer learning context, aiming to gain a deeper insight into the tension between public knowledge and model confidentiality. To this end, we propose a teacher model fingerprinting attack to infer the origin of a student model, i.e., the teacher model it transfers from. Specifically, we propose a novel optimization-based method to carefully generate queries to probe the student model to realize our attack. Unlike existing model reverse engineering approaches, our proposed fingerprinting method neither relies on fine-grained model outputs, e.g., posteriors, nor auxiliary information of the model architecture or training dataset. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed attack. The empirical results demonstrate that our attack can accurately identify the model origin with few probing queries. Moreover, we show that the proposed attack can serve as a stepping stone to facilitating other attacks against machine learning models, such as model stealing.",

We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 11 participants of these protests. Research findings reveal how protesters favoured Telegram and relied on its security for internal communication and organisation of on-the-ground collective action; were organised in small private groups and large public groups to enable collective action; adopted tactics and technologies that enable pseudonymity; and developed a variety of strategies to detect compromises and to achieve forms of forward secrecy and post-compromise security when group members were (presumed) arrested. We further show how group administrators had assumed the roles of leaders in these 'leaderless' protests and were critical to collective protest efforts.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale Internet scans are a common method to identify victims of a specific attack. Stateless scanning like in ZMap has been established as an efficient approach to probing at Internet scale. Stateless scans, however, need a second phase to perform the attack, which remains invisible to network telescopes that only capture the first incoming packet and is not observed as a related event by honeypots. In this work, we examine Internet-wide scan traffic through Spoki, a reactive network telescope operating in real-time that we design and implement. Spoki responds to asynchronous TCP SYN packets and engages in TCP handshakes initiated in the second phase of two-phase scans. Because it is extremely lightweight it scales to large prefixes where it has the unique opportunity to record the first data sequence submitted within the TCP handshake ACK. We analyze two-phase scanners during a three months period using globally deployed Spoki reactive telescopes as well as flow data sets from IXPs and ISPs. We find that a predominant fraction of TCP SYNs on the Internet has irregular characteristics. Our findings also provide a clear signature of today's scans as: (i) highly targeted, (ii) scanning activities notably vary between regional vantage points, and (iii) a significant share originates from malicious sources.",

        "abstract": "Cloud applications today are often composed of many mi-croservices. To prevent a microservice from being abused by other (compromised) microservices, inter-service access con-trol is applied. However, the complexity of \ufb01ne-grained access control policies, along with the large-scale and dynamic nature of microservices, makes the current manual con\ufb01guration-based access control unsuitable. This paper presents A U - TO A RMOR , the \ufb01rst attempt to automate inter-service access control policy generation for microservices, with two fundamental techniques: (1) a static analysis-based request extraction mechanism that automatically obtains the invocation logic among microservices, and (2) a graph-based policy management mechanism that generates corresponding access con-trol policies with on-demand policy update. Our evaluation on popular microservice applications shows that A UTO A RMOR is able to generate \ufb01ne-grained inter-service access control policies and update them timely based on changes in the application, with only a minor runtime overhead. By seamlessly integrating with the lifecycle of microservices, it does not require any changes to existing code and infrastructures.",

        "abstract": "Cyber-theft of trade secrets has become a serious business threat. Digital watermarking is a popular technique to assist in identifying the source of the \ufb01le leakage, whereby a unique watermark for each insider is hidden in sensitive \ufb01les. However, malicious insiders may use their smartphones to photograph the secret \ufb01le displayed on screens to remove the embedded hidden digital watermarks due to the optical noises introduced during photographing. To identify the leakage source despite such screen-photo-based leakage attacks , we leverage Moir\u00e9 pattern, an optical phenomenon resulted from the optical interaction between electronic screens and cameras. As such, we present mID , a new watermark-like technique that can create a carefully crafted Moir\u00e9 pattern on the photo when it is taken towards the screen. We design patterns that appear to be natural yet can be linked to the identity of the leaker. We implemented mID and evaluate it with 5 display devices and 6 smartphones from various manufacturers and models. The results demonstrate that mID can achieve an average bit error rate (BER) of 0 . 6% and can successfully identify an ID with an average accuracy of 96%, with little in\ufb02uence from the type of display devices, cameras, IDs, and ambient lights.",

        "abstract": "Current mobile platforms leave it up to the app developer to decide when to request permissions (timing) and whether to provide explanations why and how users\u2019 private data are accessed (rationales) . Given these liberties, it is important to understand how developers should use timing and ratio-nales to effectively assist users in their permission decisions. While guidelines and recommendations for developers exist, no study has systematically investigated the actual in\ufb02u-ence of timing, rationales, and their combinations on users\u2019 decision-making process. In this work, we conducted a comparative online study with 473 participants who were asked to interact with mockup apps drawn from a pool of 120 variations of 30 apps. The study design was guided by devel-opers\u2019 current permission request practices derived from a dynamic analysis of the top apps on Google Play . Our results show that there is a clear interplay between timing and rationales on users\u2019 permission decisions and the evaluation of their decisions, making the effect of rationales stronger when shown upfront and limiting the effect of timing when rationales are present. We therefore suggest adaptation to the available guidelines. We also \ufb01nd that permission decisions depend on the individuality of users, indicating that there is no one-\ufb01ts-all permission request strategy, upon we suggest better individual support and outline one possible solution.",

        "abstract": "Machine unlearning, i.e. having a model forget about some of its training data, has become increasingly more important as privacy legislation promotes variants of the right-to-be-forgotten. In the context of deep learning, approaches for machine unlearning are broadly categorized into two classes: exact unlearning methods, where an entity has formally removed the data point's impact on the model by retraining the model from scratch, and approximate unlearning, where an entity approximates the model parameters one would obtain by exact unlearning to save on compute costs. In this paper, we first show that the definition that underlies approximate unlearning, which seeks to prove the approximately unlearned model is close to an exactly retrained model, is incorrect because one can obtain the same model using different datasets. Thus one could unlearn without modifying the model at all. We then turn to exact unlearning approaches and ask how to verify their claims of unlearning. Our results show that even for a given training trajectory one cannot formally prove the absence of certain data points used during training. We thus conclude that unlearning is only well-defined at the algorithmic level, where an entity's only possible auditable claim to unlearning is that they used a particular algorithm designed to allow for external scrutiny during an audit.",

Social authentication shows promise as a novel form of fallback authentication. In this paper, we report the results of a four-week study that explored people\u2019s perceived willingness to use video chat as a form of social authentication. We investigated whether people\u2019s mood, location, and trust, and the presence of others affected perceived willingness to use video chat to authenticate. We found that participants who were alone, reported a more positive mood, and had more trust in others reported more willingness to use video chat as an authentication method. Participants also reported more willingness to help others to authenticate via video chat than to initiate a video chat authentication session themselves. Our results provide initial insights into human-computer interaction issues that could stem from using video chat as a fallback authentication method within a small social network of people (e.g., family members and close friends) who know each other well and trust each other.",

        "abstract": "While prior attempts at passwordless authentication on the web have required specialized hardware, FIDO2\u2019s WebAuthn protocol lets users sign into websites with their smartphone. Users authenticate locally via the phone\u2019s unlock mechanism. Their phone then uses public-key cryptography to authenticate to the website. Using biometrics (e.g., \ufb01ngerprint, face) for this local authentication can be convenient, yet may engender misconceptions that discourage adoption. Through three complementary studies, we characterized and sought to mitigate misconceptions about biometric WebAuthn. We also compared it to non-biometric WebAuthn and traditional passwords. First, 42 crowdworkers used biometric WebAuthn to sign into a website and then completed surveys. Critically, 67% of participants incorrectly thought their biometrics were sent to the website, creating security concerns. In remote focus groups, 27 crowdworkers then co-designed short no-ti\ufb01cations to mitigate biometric WebAuthn misconceptions. Through a 345-participant online study, we found that some noti\ufb01cations improved perceptions of biometric WebAuthn and partially addressed misconceptions, yet key misconceptions about where the biometric is stored partially persisted. Nonetheless, participants were willing to adopt biometric WebAuthn over non-biometric WebAuthn or passwords. Our work identi\ufb01es directions for increasing the adoption of bio-metric WebAuthn by highlighting its security and usability.",

At the same time, past research has shown that online trackers can use various techniques to infer the presence of installed extensions and abuse them to track users as well as uncover sensitive information about them. In this work we present a novel extension-\ufb01ngerprinting vector showing how style modi\ufb01cations from browser extensions can be abused to identify installed extensions. We propose a pipeline that analyzes extensions both statically and dynamically and pinpoints their injected style sheets. Based on these, we craft a set of triggers that uniquely identify browser extensions from the context of the visited page. We analyzed 116K extensions from Chrome\u2019s Web Store and report that 6,645 of them inject style sheets on any website that users visit. Our pipeline has created triggers that uniquely identify 4,446 of these extensions, 1,074 (24%) of which could not be \ufb01ngerprinted with previous techniques. Given the power of this new extension-\ufb01ngerprinting vector, we propose speci\ufb01c countermeasures against style \ufb01ngerprinting that have minimal impact on the overall user experience.",

        "title": "Understanding and Detecting Disordered Error Handling with Precise Function Pairing",
        "abstract": "Software programs may frequently encounter various errors such as allocation failures. Error handling aims to gracefully deal with the errors to avoid security and reliability issues, thus it is prevalent and vital. However, because of its complexity and corner cases, error handling itself is often erroneous, and prior research has primarily focused on finding bugs in the handling part, such as incorrect error-code returning or missing error propagation. In this paper, we propose and investigate a class of bugs in error-handling code from a different perspective. In particular, we find that programs often perform \u201ccleanup\u201d operations before the actual error handling, such as freeing memory or decreasing refcount. Critical bugs occur when these operations are performed (1) in an incorrect order, (2) redundantly, or (3) inadequately. We refer to such bugs as Disordered Error Handling (DiEH). Our investigation reveals that DiEH bugs are not only common but can also cause security problems such as privilege escalation, memory corruption, and denial-of-service. Based on the findings from the investigation, we then develop a system, HERO (Handling ERrors Orderly), to automatically detect DiEH. The core of HERO is a novel technique that precisely pairs both common and custom functions based on the unique error-handling structures, which allows us to infer expected cleanup functions. With HERO, we found 239 DiEH bugs in the Linux kernel, the FreeBSD kernel, and OpenSSL, which can cause security and reliability issues. The evaluation results show that DiEH is critical and widely exists in system software, and HERO is effective in detecting DiEH. We also believe that the precise function pairing is of independent interest in other research areas such as temporal-rule inference and race detection.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents our study on an emerging paradigm of payment service that allows individual merchants to leverage the personal transfer service in third-party platforms to support commercial transactions. This is made possible by leveraging an additional order management system, collectively named Personal Payment System (PPS) . To gain a better understanding of these emerging systems, we conducted a systematic study on 35 PPS s covering over 11740 mer-chant clients supporting more than 20 million customers. By examining the documentation, available source codes, and demos, we extracted a common abstracted model for PPS and discovered seven categories of vulnerabilities in the existing personal payment protocol design and system implementation. It is alarming that all PPS s under study have at least one vulnerability. To further dissect these potential weaknesses, we present the corresponding attack methods to exploit the discovered vulnerabilities. To validate our proposed attacks, we conducted four successful real attacks to illustrate the severe consequences. We have responsibly disclosed the newly discovered vulnerabilities, with some patched after our reporting.",

        "abstract": "The security of modern electronic devices relies on secret keys stored on secure hardware modules as the root-of-trust (RoT). Extracting those keys would break the security of the entire system. As shown before, sophisticated side-channel analysis (SCA) attacks, using chip failure analysis (FA) techniques, can extract data from on-chip memory cells. However, since the chip's layout is unknown to the adversary in practice, secret key localization and reverse engineering are onerous tasks. Consequently, hardware vendors commonly believe that the ever-growing physical complexity of the integrated circuit (IC) designs can be a natural barrier against potential adversaries. In this work, we present a novel approach that can extract the secret key without any knowledge of the IC's layout, and independent from the employed memory technology as key storage. We automate the -- traditionally very labor-intensive -- reverse engineering and data extraction process. To that end, we demonstrate that black-box measurements captured using laser-assisted SCA techniques from a training device with known key can be used to profile the device for a later key prediction on other victim devices with unknown keys. To showcase the potential of our approach, we target keys on three different hardware platforms, which are utilized as RoT in different products.",

        "abstract": "The \ufb01nal responsibility to verify whether a newly purchased hardware security token (HST) is authentic and unmodi\ufb01ed lies with the end user. However, recently reported attacks on such tokens suggest that users cannot take the security guarantees of their HSTs for granted, even despite widely deployed authenticity checks. We present the \ufb01rst comprehensive market review evaluating the effectiveness and usability of authenticity checks for the most commonly used HSTs. Furthermore, we conducted a survey ( n = 194) to examine users\u2019 perceptions and usage of these checks. We found that due to a lack of transparency and information, users often do not carry out\u2014or even are not aware of\u2014essential checks but rely on less meaningful methods. Moreover, our results con\ufb01rm that currently deployed authenticity checks suffer from improperly perceived effectiveness and cannot mitigate all variants of distribution attacks. Furthermore, some authenticity concepts of different manufacturers contradict each other. In order to address these challenges, we suggest (i) a combination of conventional and novel authenticity checks, and (ii) a user-centered, transparent design.",

        "title": "LIGHTBLUE: Automatic Profile-Aware Debloating of Bluetooth Stacks",
        "abstract": "The Bluetooth standard is ubiquitously supported by computers, smartphones, and IoT devices. Due to its complexity, implementations require large codebases, which are prone to security vulnerabilities, such as the recently discovered BlueBorne and BadBluetooth attacks. While de\ufb01ned by the standard, most of the Bluetooth functionality, as de\ufb01ned by different Bluetooth pro\ufb01les, is not required in the common usage scenarios. Starting from this observation, we implement L IGHT B LUE , a framework performing automatic, pro\ufb01le-aware debloating of Bluetooth stacks, allowing users to automatically minimize their Bluetooth attack surface by removing unneeded Blue-tooth features. L IGHT B LUE starts with a target Bluetooth application, detects the associated Bluetooth pro\ufb01les, and applies a combination of control-\ufb02ow and data-\ufb02ow analysis to remove unused code within a Bluetooth host code. Furthermore, to debloat the Bluetooth \ufb01rmware, L IGHT B LUE extracts the used Host Controller Interface (HCI) commands and patches the HCI dispatcher in the Bluetooth \ufb01rmware automatically, so that the Bluetooth \ufb01rmware avoids processing unneeded HCI commands. We evaluate L IGHT B LUE on four different Bluetooth hosts and three different Bluetooth controllers. Our evaluation shows that L IGHT B LUE achieves between 32% and 50% code reduction in the Bluetooth host code and between 57% and 83% HCI command reduction",

        "abstract": "We present the first over-the-air attack on IEEE 802.15.4z High-Rate Pulse Repetition Frequency (HRP) Ultra-WideBand (UWB) distance measurement systems. Specifically, we demonstrate a practical distance reduction attack against pairs of Apple U1 chips (embedded in iPhones and AirTags), as well as against U1 chips inter-operating with NXP and Qorvo UWB chips. These chips have been deployed in a wide range of phones and cars to secure car entry and start and are projected for secure contactless payments, home locks, and contact tracing systems. Our attack operates without any knowledge of cryptographic material, results in distance reductions from 12m (actual distance) to 0m (spoofed distance) with attack success probabilities of up to 4%, and requires only an inexpensive (USD 65) off-the-shelf device. Access control can only tolerate sub-second latencies to not inconvenience the user, leaving little margin to perform time-consuming verifications. These distance reductions bring into question the use of UWB HRP in security-critical applications.",

The commercial sex industry is increasingly Internet-mediated. As such, sex workers are facing new challenges in protecting their digital privacy and security and avoiding serious consequences such as stalking, blackmail, and social exclusion. Through interviews ( n =29) and a survey ( n =65) with sex workers in European countries where sex work is legal and regulated, we \ufb01nd that sex workers have well-de\ufb01ned safety goals and clear awareness of the risks to their safety: clients, de\ufb01cient legal protections, and hostile digital platforms. In response to these risks, our participants developed complex strategies for protecting their safety, but use few tools speci\ufb01cally designed for security and privacy. Our results suggest that if even high-risk users with clear risk conceptions view existing tools as insuf\ufb01ciently effective to merit the cost of use, these tools are not actually addressing their real security needs. Our \ufb01ndings underscore the importance of more holistic design of security tools to address both online and of\ufb02ine axes of safety.",

Despite their additional power over traditional web attackers, related-domain attackers received only limited attention from the research community. In this paper we de\ufb01ne and quantify for the \ufb01rst time the threats that related-domain attackers pose to web application security. In particular, we \ufb01rst clarify the capabilities that related-domain attackers can acquire through different attack vectors, showing that different instances of the related-domain attacker concept are worth attention. We then study how these capabilities can be abused to compromise web application security by focusing on different angles, including cookies, CSP, CORS, postMessage, and domain relaxation. By building on this framework, we report on a large-scale security measurement on the top 50k domains from the Tranco list that led to the discovery of vulnerabilities in 887 sites, where we quanti\ufb01ed the threats posed by related-domain attackers to popular web applications.",

        "abstract": "We identify class of covert channels in browsers that are not mitigated by current defenses, which we call\"pool-party\"attacks. Pool-party attacks allow sites to create covert channels by manipulating limited-but-unpartitioned resource pools. These class of attacks have been known, but in this work we show that they are both more prevalent, more practical for exploitation, and allow exploitation in more ways, than previously identified. These covert channels have sufficient bandwidth to pass cookies and identifiers across site boundaries under practical and real-world conditions. We identify pool-party attacks in all popular browsers, and show they are practical cross-site tracking techniques (i.e., attacks take 0.6s in Chrome and Edge, and 7s in Firefox and Tor Browser). In this paper we make the following contributions: first, we describe pool-party covert channel attacks that exploit limits in application-layer resource pools in browsers. Second, we demonstrate that pool-party attacks are practical, and can be used to track users in all popular browsers; we also share open source implementations of the attack and evaluate them through a representative web crawl. Third, we show that in Gecko based-browsers (including the Tor Browser) pool-party attacks can also be used for cross-profile tracking (e.g., linking user behavior across normal and private browsing sessions). Finally, we discuss possible mitigation strategies and defenses",

To assess customer support\u2019s existing practices and identify areas for improvement, we conducted \ufb01ve focus groups with professionals who work with IPV survivors ( n = 17). IPV professionals made numerous suggestions, such as using trauma-informed language, avoiding promises to solve problems, and making referrals to resources and support organizations. To evaluate the practicality of these suggestions, we conducted four focus groups with customer support practitioners ( n = 11). Support practitioners expressed interest in training agents for IPV cases, but mentioned challenges in identifying potential survivors and frontline agents\u2019 limited capacity to help. We conclude with recommendations for computer security companies to better address tech-enabled IPV through training support agents, tracking the prevalence of these cases, and establishing partnerships with IPV advocates.",

        "title": "On the Routing-Aware Peering against Network-Eclipse Attacks in Bitcoin",
        "abstract": "Safeguarding blockchain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks is more critical than ever in light of recent network attacks. Bitcoin has been successfully handling traditional Sybil and eclipse attacks; however, a recent Erebus attack [57] shows that effectively eclipsing a Bitcoin node is possible when the attack is combined with a network-Sybil capability; i.e., a malicious transit network can create millions or more Sybil identities. Given the immediate availability and stealthiness of the Erebus attack, Bitcoin Core has quickly implemented a few simple protocol/parameter changes to mitigate it. Our large-scale evaluations of these quick patches and three similar carefully-designed protocol tweaks confirm that, unfortunately, no simple solution can effectively handle the attack. This paper focuses on a more fundamental solution called routing-aware peering (or RAP), a proven silver bullet in detecting and circumventing similar network adversaries in other P2P networks. However, we show that, contrary to our expectation, preventing the Erebus attacks with RAP is only wishful thinking. We discover that Erebus adversaries can exploit a tiny portion of route inference errors in any RAP implementations, which gives an asymmetric advantage to the network adversaries and renders all RAP approaches ineffective. To that end, we propose an integrated defense framework that composes the available simple protocol tweaks and RAP implementation. In particular, we show that a highly customizable defense profile is required for individual Bitcoin nodes because RAP\u2019s efficacy depends significantly on where a Bitcoin node is located on the Internet topology. We present an algorithm that outputs a custom optimal defense profile that prevents most of Erebus attacks from the top-100 large transit networks.",

        "abstract": "Hardware flaws are permanent and potent: hardware cannot be patched once fabricated, and any flaws may undermine any software executing on top. Consequently, verification time dominates implementation time. The gold standard in hardware Design Verification (DV) is concentrated at two extremes: random dynamic verification and formal verification. Both struggle to root out the subtle flaws in complex hardware that often manifest as security vulnerabilities. The root problem with random verification is its undirected nature, making it inefficient, while formal verification is constrained by the state-space explosion problem, making it infeasible against complex designs. What is needed is a solution that is directed, yet under-constrained. Instead of making incremental improvements to existing DV approaches, we leverage the observation that existing software fuzzers already provide such a solution, and adapt them for hardware DV. Specifically, we translate RTL hardware to a software model and fuzz that model. The central challenge we address is how best to mitigate the differences between the hardware execution model and software execution model. This includes: 1) how to represent test cases, 2) what is the hardware equivalent of a crash, 3) what is an appropriate coverage metric, and 4) how to create a general-purpose fuzzing harness for hardware. To evaluate our approach, we fuzz four IP blocks from Google's OpenTitan SoC. Our experiments reveal a two orders-of-magnitude reduction in run time to achieve Finite State Machine (FSM) coverage over traditional dynamic verification schemes. Moreover, with our design-agnostic harness, we achieve over 88% HDL line coverage in three out of four of our designs -- even without any initial seeds.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the rise of security risks of libraries integrated in mobile apps, which are reported to steal private user data from the host apps and the app backend servers. Their security implications, however, have never been fully understood. In our research, we brought to light a new attack vector long been ignored yet with serious privacy impacts \u2013 malicious libraries strategically target other vendors\u2019 SDKs integrated in the same host app to harvest private user data (e.g., Facebook\u2019s user pro\ufb01le). Using a methodology that incorporates semantic analysis on an SDK\u2019s Terms of Services (ToS, which describes restricted data access and sharing policies) and code analysis on cross-library interactions, we were able to investigate 1.3 million Google Play apps and the ToSes from 40 highly-popular SDKs, leading to the discovery of 42 distinct libraries stealthily harvesting data from 16 popular SDKs, which affect more than 19K apps with a total of 9 billion downloads. Our study further sheds light on the under-ground ecosystem behind such library-based data harvesting (e.g., monetary incentives for SDK integration), their unique strategies (e.g., hiding data in crash reports and using C2 server to schedule data ex\ufb01ltration) and signi\ufb01cant impacts.",

        "abstract": "Effective query recovery attacks against Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) schemes typically rely on auxiliary ground-truth information about the queries or dataset. Query recovery is also possible under the weaker statistical auxiliary information assumption, although statistical-based attacks achieve lower accuracy and are not considered a serious threat. In this work we present IHOP, a statistical-based query recovery attack that formulates query recovery as a quadratic optimization problem and reaches a solution by iterating over linear assignment problems. We perform an extensive evaluation with five real datasets, and show that IHOP outperforms all other statistical-based query recovery attacks under different parameter and leakage configurations, including the case where the client uses some access-pattern obfuscation defenses. In some cases, our attack achieves almost perfect query recovery accuracy. Finally, we use IHOP in a frequency-only leakage setting where the client's queries are correlated, and show that our attack can exploit query dependencies even when PANCAKE, a recent frequency-hiding defense by Grubbs et al., is applied. Our findings indicate that statistical query recovery attacks pose a severe threat to privacy-preserving SSE schemes.",

        "abstract": "The security of FPGAs is a crucial topic, as any vulnerability within the hardware can have severe consequences, if they are used in a secure design. Since FPGA designs are encoded in a bitstream, securing the bitstream is of the utmost importance. Adversaries have many motivations to recover and manipulate the bitstream, including design cloning, IP theft, manipulation of the design, or design subversions e.g., through hardware Trojans. Given that FPGAs are often part of cyber-physical systems e.g., in aviation, medical, or industrial devices, this can even lead to physical harm. Consequently, vendors have introduced bitstream encryption, offering authenticity and confidentiality. Even though attacks against bitstream encryption have been proposed in the past, e.g., side-channel analysis and probing, these attacks require sophisticated equipment and considerable technical expertise. In this paper, we introduce novel low-cost attacks against the Xilinx 7-Series (and Virtex-6) bitstream encryption, resulting in the total loss of authenticity and confidentiality. We exploit a design flaw which piecewise leaks the decrypted bitstream. In the attack, the FPGA is used as a decryption oracle, while only access to a configuration interface is needed. The attack does not require any sophisticated tools and, depending on the target system, can potentially be launched remotely. In addition to the attacks, we discuss several countermeasures.",

        "abstract": "Online privacy settings aim to provide users with control over their data. However, in their current state, they suffer from usability and reachability issues. The recent push towards automatically analyzing privacy notices has not ac-companied a similar effort for the more critical case of privacy settings. So far, the best efforts targeted the special case of making opt-out pages more reachable. In this work, we present PriSEC, a Privacy Settings Enforcement Controller that leverages machine learning techniques towards a new paradigm for automatically enforcing web privacy controls. PriSEC goes beyond \ufb01nding the webpages with privacy settings to discovering \ufb01ne-grained options, presenting them in a searchable, centralized interface, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 enforcing them on-demand with minimal user intervention. We overcome the open nature of web development through novel algorithms that leverage the invariant behavior and rendering of webpages. We evaluate the performance of PriSEC to \ufb01nd that it precisely annotates the privacy controls for 94.3% of the control pages in our evaluation set. To demonstrate the usability of PriSEC, we conduct a user study with 148 participants. We show an average reduction of 3.75x in the time taken to adjust privacy settings compared to the baseline system.",

        "title": "Balboa: Bobbing and Weaving around Network Censorship",
        "abstract": "We introduce Balboa, a link obfuscation framework for censorship circumvention. Balboa provides a general framework for tunneling data through existing applications. Balboa sits between an application and the operating system, intercepting outgoing network traffic and rewriting it to embed data. To avoid introducing any distinguishable divergence from the expected application behavior, Balboa only rewrites traffic that matches an externally specified \\emph{traffic model} pre-shared between the communicating parties. The traffic model captures some subset of the network traffic (e.g., some subset of music an audio streaming server streams). The sender uses this model to replace outgoing data with a pointer to the associated location in the model and embed data in the freed up space. The receiver then extracts the data, replacing the pointer with the original data from the model before passing the data on to the application. When using TLS, this approach means that application behavior with Balboa is \\emph{equivalent}, modulo small (protocol-dependent) timing differences, to if the application was running without Balboa. Balboa differs from prior approaches in that it (1) provides a framework for tunneling data through arbitrary (TLS-protected) protocols/applications, and (2) runs the unaltered application binaries on standard inputs, as opposed to most prior tunneling approaches which run the application on non-standard -- and thus potentially distinguishable -- inputs. We present two instantiations of Balboa -- one for audio streaming and one for web browsing -- and demonstrate the difficulty of identifying Balboa by a machine learning classifier.",

Yet traditional DIFA approaches have limited utility for distributed software due to applicability , portability , and scalability barriers. We present F LOW D IST , a DIFA for common distributed software that overcomes these challenges. F LOW D IST works at purely application level to avoid platform customizations hence achieve high portability . It infers implicit, interprocess dependencies from global partially ordered execution events to address applicability to distributed software. Most of all, it introduces a multi-staged re\ufb01nement-based scheme for application-level DIFA, where an otherwise expensive data \ufb02ow analysis is reduced by method-level results from a cheap pre-analysis, to achieve high scalability while remaining effective. Our evaluation of F LOW D IST on 12 real-world distributed systems against two peer tools revealed its superior effectiveness with practical ef\ufb01ciency and scalability. It has found 18 known and 24 new vulnerabilities, with 17 con\ufb01rmed and 2 \ufb01xed. We also present and evaluate two alternative designs of F LOW D IST for both design justi\ufb01cation and diverse subject accommodations.",

        "abstract": "Directed greybox fuzzing is an augmented fuzzing technique intended for the targeted usages such as crash reproduction and proof-of-concept generation, which gives directed-ness to fuzzing by driving the seeds toward the designated program locations called target sites. However, we find that directed greybox fuzzing can still su ff er from the long fuzzing time before exposing the targeted crash, because it does not consider the ordered target sites and the data conditions. This paper presents constraint-guided directed greybox fuzzing that aims to satisfy a sequence of constraints rather than merely reaching a set of target sites. Constraint-guided grey-box fuzzing defines a constraint as the combination of a target site and the data conditions, and drives the seeds to satisfy the constraints in the specified order. We automatically generate the constraints with seven types of crash dumps and four types of patch changelogs, and evaluate the prototype system CAFL against the representative directed greybox fuzzing system AFLGo with 47 real-world crashes and 12 patch changelogs. The evaluation shows CAFL outperforms AFLGo by 2.88x for crash reproduction, and better performs in PoC generation as the constraints get explicit.",

        "abstract": "Since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in May 2018, online services are required to obtain users\u2019 explicit consent before sharing users\u2019 personal data with third parties that use the data for their own purposes. While violations of this legal basis on the Web have been studied in-depth, the community lacks insight into such violations in the mobile ecosystem. We perform the \ufb01rst large-scale measurement on Android apps in the wild to understand the current state of the violation of GDPR\u2019s explicit consent. Speci\ufb01cally, we build a semi-automated pipeline to detect data sent out to the Internet without prior consent and apply it to a set of 86,163 Android apps. Based on the domains that receive data protected under the GDPR without prior consent, we collaborate with a legal scholar to assess if these contacted domains are third-party data controllers. Doing so, we \ufb01nd 24,838 apps send personal data towards data controllers without the user\u2019s explicit prior consent. To understand the reasons behind this, we run a noti-\ufb01cation campaign to inform affected developers and gather insights from their responses. We then conduct an in-depth analysis of violating apps as well as the corresponding third parties\u2019 documentation and privacy policies. Based on the responses and our analysis of available documentation, we derive concrete recommendations for all involved entities in the ecosystem to allow data subjects to exercise their fundamental rights and freedoms.",

        "abstract": "The explosive growth of biometrics use (e.g., in surveillance) poses a persistent challenge to keep biometric data private without sacri\ufb01cing the apps\u2019 functionality. We consider private querying of a real-life biometric scan (e.g., a person\u2019s face) against a private biometric database. The querier learns only the label(s) of a matching scan(s) (e.g. a person\u2019s name), and the database server learns nothing. We formally de\ufb01ne Fuzzy Labeled Private Set Intersection (FLPSI), a primitive computing the intersection of noisy input sets by considering closeness/similarity instead of equality. Our FLPSI protocol\u2019s communication is sublinear in database size and is concretely ef\ufb01cient. We implement it and apply it to facial search by integrating with our \ufb01ne-tuned toolchain that maps face images into Hamming space. We have implemented and extensively tested our system, achieving high performance with concretely small network usage: for a 10K-row database, the query response time over WAN (resp. fast LAN) is 146ms (resp. 47ms), transferring 12.1MB; of\ufb02ine precomputation (with no communication) time is 0.94s. FLPSI scales well: for a 1M-row database, on-line time is 1.66s (WAN) and 1.46s (fast LAN) with 40.8MB of data transfer in online phase and 37.5s in of\ufb02ine precom-putation. This improves the state-of-the-art work (SANNS) by 9 \u2212 25 \u00d7 (on WAN) and 1 . 2 \u2212 4 \u00d7 (on fast LAN). Our false non-matching rate is 0.75% for at most 10 false matches over 1M-row DB, which is comparable to underlying plaintext matching algorithm.",

Unfortunately, this requires repeated context switching between different tools and incurs a high cognitive load on the analyst, slowing down the investigation and giving attackers an advantage. We present Forecast, a post-detection technique to enable incident responders to automatically predict capabilities which malware have staged for execution. Forecast is based on a probabilistic model that allows Forecast to discover capabilities and also weigh each capability according to its relative likelihood of execution (i.e., forecasts). Forecast leverages the execution context of the ongoing attack (from the malware\u2019s memory image) to guide a symbolic analysis of the malware\u2019s code. We performed extensive evaluations, with 6,727 real-world malware and futuristic attacks aiming to subvert Forecast, showing the accuracy and robustness in predicting malware capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) are used to ensure con\ufb01dence among developers, to share information about software vulnerabilities, and to provide a baseline for security measures. Therefore, the correctness of CVE reports is crucial for detecting and patching software vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce the concept of \u201cVulnerability Zero\u201d (VZ), the software where a vulnerability \ufb01rst originated. We then present V0Finder , a precise mechanism for discovering the VZ of a vulnerability, including software name and its version. V0Finder utilizes code-based analysis to identify reuse relations, which specify the direction of vulnerability propagation, among vulnerable software. V0Finder constructs a graph from all the identi\ufb01ed directions and traces backward to the root of that graph to \ufb01nd the VZ. We applied V0Finder to 5,671 CVE vulnerabilities collected from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and popular Bugzilla-based projects. V0Finder discovered VZs with high accuracy of 98% precision and 95% recall. Furthermore, V0Finder identi\ufb01ed 96 CVEs with incorrect information related to their respective VZs. We con\ufb01rmed that the incorrect VZ causes prolonged patch updates of vulnerable software; the patch update of CVEs with the incorrect VZ information takes 2 years, while the patch update of CVEs with the correct VZ takes less than a year on average. Such in-correctly identi\ufb01ed VZ hinders the objective of the CVE and causes confusion rather than \u201censuring con\ufb01dence\u201d among developers. Our analysis shows that V0Finder can enhance the credibility of information provided by the CVEs.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we set out to systematically design a minimal active RoT for tiny low-end MCU-s. We begin with the following questions: (1) What functions and hardware support are required to guarantee actions in the presence of malware?, (2) How to implement this efficiently?, and (3) What security benefits stem from such an active RoT architecture? We then design, implement, formally verify, and evaluate GAROTA: Generalized Active Root-Of-Trust Architecture. We believe that GAROTA is the first clean-slate design of an active RoT for low-end MCU-s. We show how GAROTA guarantees that even a fully software-compromised low-end MCU performs a desired action. We demonstrate its practicality by implementing GAROTA in the context of three types of applications where actions are triggered by: sensing hardware, network events and timers. We also formally specify and verify GAROTA functionality and properties.",

        "abstract": "We present the SLIC that achieves \ufb01ne-grained location tracking (e.g., \ufb01nding indoor walking paths) of targeted cellular user devices in a passive manner. The attack exploits a new side channel in modern cellular systems through a universally available feature called carrier aggregation (CA). CA enables higher cellular data rates by allowing multiple base stations on different carrier frequencies to concurrently transmit to a single user. We discover that a passive adversary can learn the side channel \u2014 namely, the number of actively transmitting base stations for any user of interest in the same macrocell. We then show that a time series of this side channel can consti-tute a highly unique \ufb01ngerprint of a walking path, which can be used to identify the path taken by a target cellular user. We \ufb01rst demonstrate the collection of the new side channel and a small-scale path identi\ufb01cation attack in an existing LTE-A network with up to three CA capability (i.e., three base stations can be coordinated for concurrent transmission), showing the feasibility of SLIC in the current cellular networks. We then emulate a near-future 5G network environment with up to nine CA capability in various multi-story buildings in our institution. SLIC shows up to 98.4% of path-identi\ufb01cation accuracy among 100 different walking paths in a large of\ufb01ce building. Through testing in various building structures, we con\ufb01rm that the attack is effective in typical of\ufb01ce building environments; e.g., corridors, open spaces. We present com-plete and partial countermeasures and discuss some practical cell deployment suggestions",

        "abstract": "Over the past two decades, packed malware is always a ve-ritable challenge to security analysts. Not only is determining the end of the unpacking increasingly dif\ufb01cult, but also advanced packers embed a variety of anti-analysis tricks to impede reverse engineering. As malware\u2019s APIs provide rich information about malicious behavior, one common anti-analysis strategy is API obfuscation, which removes the metadata of imported APIs from malware\u2019s PE header and complicates API name resolution from API callsites. In this way, even when security analysts obtain the unpacked code, a disassem-bler still fails to recognize imported API names, and the unpac-ked code cannot be successfully executed. Recently, generic binary unpacking has made breakthrough progress with noticeable performance improvement. However, reconstructing unpacked code\u2019s import tables, which is vital for further malware static/dynamic analyses, has largely been overlooked. Existing approaches are far from mature: they either can be easily evaded by various API obfuscation schemes (e.g., stolen code), or suffer from incomplete API coverage. In this paper, we aim to achieve the ultimate goal of Windows malware unpacking: recovering an executable malware program from the packed and obfuscated binary code.

        "title": "APICraft: Fuzz Driver Generation for Closed-source SDK Libraries",
        "abstract": "Fuzz drivers are needed for fuzzing libraries. A fuzz driver is a program which can execute library functions by feeding them with inputs provided by the fuzzer. In practice, fuzz drivers are written by security experts and the drivers\u2019 quality depends on the skill of their authors. To relieve manual efforts and ensure test quality, different techniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers. However, existing techniques mostly rely on static analysis of source code, leaving the fuzz driver generation for closed-source SDK libraries an open problem. Fuzz driver generation for closed-source libraries is faced with two major challenges: 1) only limited information can be extracted from the library; 2) the semantic relations among API functions are complex yet their correctness needs to be ensured. To address these challenges, we propose APIC RAFT , an automated fuzz driver generation technique. The core strategy of APIC RAFT is collect \u2013 combine . First, APIC RAFT leverages both static and dynamic information (headers, binaries, and traces) to collect control and data dependencies for API functions in a practical manner. Then, it uses a multi-objective genetic algorithm to combine the collected dependencies and build high-quality fuzz drivers. We implemented APIC RAFT as a fuzz driver generation framework and evaluated it with \ufb01ve attack surfaces from the macOS SDK. In the evaluation, the fuzz drivers generated by APIC RAFT demonstrate superior code coverage than the manually written ones, with an improvement of 64% on average. We further carried out a long-term fuzzing campaign with the fuzz drivers generated by APIC RAFT . After around eight month\u2019s fuzzing, we\u2019ve so far discovered 142 vulnerabilities with 54 assigned CVEs in macOS SDK, which can affect popular Apple products such as Safari , Messages , Preview and so on.",

        "abstract": "An attacker can obtain a valid TLS certi\ufb01cate for a domain by hijacking communication between a certi\ufb01cate authority (CA) and a victim domain. Performing domain validation from multiple vantage points can defend against these attacks. We explore the design space of multi-vantage-point domain validation to achieve 1) security via suf\ufb01ciently diverse vantage points, (2) performance by ensuring low latency and overhead in certi\ufb01cate issuance, (3) manageability by complying with CA/Browser forum requirements, and requiring minimal changes to CA operations, and (4) a low benign failure rate for legitimate requests. Our open-source implementation was deployed by the Let\u2019s Encrypt CA in February 2020, and has since secured the issuance of more than 300 million certi\ufb01cates. We show our approach has negligible latency and communication overhead, and a benign failure rate comparable to conventional designs with one vantage point. Finally, we evaluate the security improvements using a combination of ethically conducted real-world BGP hijacks, Internet-scale traceroute experiments, and a novel BGP simulation framework. We show that multi-vantage-point domain validation can thwart the vast majority of BGP attacks. Our work motivates the deployment of multi-vantage-point domain validation across the CA ecosystem to strengthen TLS certi\ufb01cate issuance and user privacy.",

        "abstract": "Security companies often use web crawlers to detect phishing and other social engineering attack websites. We built a novel, scalable, low-cost framework named PhishPrint to enable the evaluation of such web security crawlers against multiple cloaking attacks. PhishPrint is unique in that it completely avoids the use of any simulated phishing sites and blocklisting measurements. Instead, it uses web pages with benign content to pro\ufb01le security crawlers. We used PhishPrint to evaluate 23 security crawlers including highly ubiquitous services such as Google Safe Browsing and Microsoft Outlook e-mail scanners. Our 70-day evaluation found several previously unknown cloaking weaknesses across the crawler ecosystem. In particular, we show that all the crawlers\u2019 browsers are either not supporting advanced \ufb01ngerprinting related web APIs (such as Canvas API) or are severely lacking in \ufb01ngerprint diversity thus exposing them to new \ufb01ngerprinting-based cloaking attacks. We con\ufb01rmed the practical impact of our \ufb01ndings by deploying 20 evasive phishing web pages that exploit the found weaknesses. 18 of the pages managed to survive inde\ufb01nitely despite aggressive self-reporting of the pages to all crawlers. We con\ufb01rmed the speci\ufb01city of these attack vectors with 1150 volunteers as well as 467K web users. We also proposed countermeasures that all crawlers should take up in terms of both their crawling and reporting infrastructure. We have relayed the found weaknesses to all entities through an elaborate vulnerability disclosure process that resulted in some remedial actions as well as multiple vulnerability rewards.",

        "abstract": "Our current defenses against IoT malware may not be adequate to remediate an IoT malware attack similar to the Mirai botnet. This work seeks to investigate this matter by systematically and empirically studying the lifecycle of IoT malware and comparing it with traditional malware that target desktop and mobile platforms. We present a large-scale measurement of more than 166K Linux-based IoT malware samples collected over a year. We compare our results with prior works by systematizing desktop and mobile malware studies into a novel framework and answering key questions about defense readiness. Based on our findings, we deduce that the required technology to defend against IoT malware is available, but we conclude that there are insufficient efforts in place to deal with a large-scale IoT malware infection breakout.",

        "title": "Catching Phishers By Their Bait: Investigating the Dutch Phishing Landscape through Phishing Kit Detection",
        "abstract": "Off-the-shelf, easy-to-deploy phishing kits are believed to lower the threshold for criminal entrepreneurs going phishing. That is, the practice of harvesting user credentials by tricking victims into disclosing these on fraudulent websites. But, how do these kits impact the phishing landscape? And, how often are they used? We leverage the use of TLS certi\ufb01cates by phishers to uncover possible Dutch phishing domains aimed at the \ufb01nancial sector between September 2020 and January 2021. We collect 70 different Dutch phishing kits in the un-derground economy, and identify 10 distinct kit families. We create unique \ufb01ngerprints of these kits to measure their prevalence in the wild. With this novel method, we identify 1,363 Dutch phishing domains that deploy these phishing kits, and capture their end-to-end life cycle \u2013 from domain registration, kit deployment, to take-down. We \ufb01nd the median uptime of phishing domains to be just 24 hours, indicating that phishers do act fast. Our analysis of the deployed phishing kits reveals that only a small number of different kits are in use. We discover that phishers increase their luring capabilities by using decoy pages to trick victims into disclosing their credentials. In this paper, we paint a comprehensive picture of the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) prevalent in the Dutch phishing landscape and present public policy takeaways for anti-phishing initiatives.",
