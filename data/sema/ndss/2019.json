        "abstract": "We present DroidCap, a retrofitting of Android\u2019s central Binder IPC mechanism to change the way how permissions are being represented and managed in the system. In DroidCap, permissions are per-process Binder object capabilities. DroidCap's design removes Android\u2019s UID-based ambient authority and allows the delegation of capabilities between processes to create least-privileged protection domains efficiently. With DroidCap, we show that object capabilities as underlying access control model integrates naturally and backward-compatible into Android\u2019s stock permission model and application management. Thus, our Binder capabilities provide app developers with a new path to gradually adopting app compartmentalization, which we showcase at two favorite examples from the literature, privilege separated advertisement libraries and least privileged app components.",

        "abstract": "Google\u2019s Nearby Connections API enables any An-droid (and Android Things) application to provide proximity-based services to its users, regardless of their network connectivity.The API uses Bluetooth BR/EDR, Bluetooth LE and Wi-Fi to let\u201cnearby\u201d clients (discoverers) and servers (advertisers) connectand exchange different types of payloads. The implementation ofthe API is proprietary, closed-source and obfuscated. The updatesof the API are automatically installed by Google across differentversions of Android, without user interaction. Little is knownpublicly about the security guarantees offered by the API, eventhough it presents a significant attack surface.In this work we present the first security analysis of theGoogle\u2019s Nearby Connections API, based on reverse-engineeringof its Android implementation. We discover and implement sev-eral attacks grouped into two families: connection manipulation(CMA) and range extension attacks (REA). CMA-attacks allow anattacker to insert himself as a man-in-the-middle and manipulateconnections (even unrelated to nearby), and to tamper withthe victim\u2019s interface and network configuration. REA-attacksallow an attacker to tunnel any nearby connection to remotelocations, even between two honest devices. Our attacks areenabled by REArby, a toolkit we developed while reversingthe API implementation. REArby includes a dynamic binaryinstrumenter, a packet dissector, and the implementations ofcustom Nearby Connections client and server. We plan to open-source REArby after a responsible disclosure period.",

        "abstract": "The Facebook advertising platform has been subject to a number of controversies in the past years regarding privacy violations, lack of transparency, as well as its capacity to be used by dishonest actors for discrimination or propaganda. In this study, we aim to provide a better understanding of the Facebook advertising ecosystem, focusing on how it is being used by advertisers. We first analyze the set of advertisers and then investigate how those advertisers are targeting users and customizing ads via the platform. Our analysis is based on the data we collected from over 600 real-world users via a browser extension that collects the ads our users receive when they browse their Facebook timeline, as well as the explanations for why users received these ads. Our results reveal that users are targeted by a wide range of advertisers (e.g., from popular to niche advertisers); that a non-negligible fraction of advertisers are part of potentially sensitive categories such as news and politics, health or religion; that a significant number of advertisers employ targeting strategies that could be either invasive or opaque; and that many advertisers use a variety of targeting parameters and ad texts. Overall, our work emphasizes the need for better mechanisms to audit ads and advertisers in social media and provides an overview of the platform usage that can help move towards such mechanisms.",

However, the ubiquitous deployment of VA devices and the increasing number of third-party applications have raised security and privacy concerns. While previous works such as hidden voice attacks mostly examine the problems of VA services\u2019 default Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) component, our work analyzes and evaluates the security of the succeeding component after ASR, i.e., Natural Language Understanding (NLU), which performs semantic interpretation (i.e., text-to-intent) after ASR\u2019s acoustic-to-text processing. In particular, we focus on NLU\u2019s Intent Classi\ufb01er which is used in customizing machine understanding for third-party VA Applications (or vApps). We \ufb01nd that the semantic inconsistency caused by the improper semantic interpretation of an Intent Classi\ufb01er can create the opportunity of breaching the integrity of vApp processing when attackers delicately leverage some common spoken errors. In this paper, we design the \ufb01rst linguistic-model-guided fuzzing tool, named LipFuzzer, to assess the security of Intent Classi\ufb01er and systematically discover potential misinterpretation-prone spoken errors based on vApps\u2019 voice command templates. To guide the fuzzing, we construct adversarial linguistic models with the help of Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) and emerging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. In evaluation, we have successfully veri\ufb01ed the effectiveness and accuracy of LipFuzzer. We also use LipFuzzer to evaluate both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant vApp platforms.

        "title": "TASE: Reducing latency of symbolic execution with transactional memory",
        "abstract": "We present the design and implementation of a tool called TASE that uses transactional memory to reduce the latency of symbolic-execution applications with small amounts of symbolic state. Execution paths are executed natively while operating on concrete values, and only when execution encounters symbolic values (or modeled functions) is native execution suspended and interpretation begun. Execution then returns to its native mode when symbolic values are no longer encountered. The key innovations in the design of TASE are a technique for amortizing the cost of checking whether values are symbolic over few instructions, and the use of hardware-supported transactional memory (TSX) to implement native execution that rolls back with no effect when use of a symbolic value is detected (perhaps belatedly). We show that TASE has the potential to dramatically improve some latency-sensitive applications of symbolic execution, such as methods to verify the behavior of a client in a client-server application.",

        "title": "JavaScript Template Attacks: Automatically Inferring Host Information for Targeted Exploits",
        "abstract": "Today, more and more web browsers and extensions provide anonymity features to hide user details. Primarily used to evade tracking by websites and advertisements, these features are also used by criminals to prevent identification. Thus, not only tracking companies but also law-enforcement agencies have an interest in finding flaws which break these anonymity features. For instance, for targeted exploitation using zero days, it is essential to have as much information about the target as possible. A failed exploitation attempt, e.g., due to a wrongly guessed operating system, can burn the zero-day, effectively costing the attacker money. Also for side-channel attacks, it is of the utmost importance to know certain aspects of the victim\u2019s hardware configuration, e.g., the instruction-set architecture. Moreover, knowledge about specific environmental properties, such as the operating system, allows crafting more plausible dialogues for phishing attacks. In this paper, we present a fully automated approach to find subtle differences in browser engines caused by the environment. Furthermore, we present two new side-channel attacks on browser engines to detect the instruction-set architecture and the used memory allocator. Using these differences, we can deduce information about the system, both about the software as well as the hardware. As a result, we cannot only ease the creation of fingerprints, but we gain the advantage of having a more precise picture for targeted exploitation. Our approach allows automating the cumbersome manual search for such differences. We collect all data available to the JavaScript engine and build templates from these properties. If a property of such a template stays the same on one system but differs on a different system, we found an environment-dependent property. We found environment-dependent properties in Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and mobile Tor, allowing us to reveal the underlying operating system, CPU architecture, used privacy-enhancing plugins, as well as exact browser version. We stress that our method should be used in the development of browsers and privacy extensions to automatically find flaws in the implementation.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) introduces an unprecedented diversity and ubiquity to networked computing. It also introduces new attack surfaces that are a boon to attackers. The recent Mirai botnet showed the potential and power of a collection of compromised IoT devices. A new botnet, known as Hajime, targets many of the same devices as Mirai, but differs considerably in its design and operation. Hajime uses a public peer-to-peer system as its command and control infrastructure, and regularly introduces new exploits, thereby increasing its resilience. We show that Hajime\u2019s distributed design makes it a valuable tool for better understanding IoT botnets. For instance, Hajime cleanly separates its bots into different peer groups depending on their underlying hardware architecture. Through detailed measurement\u2014active scanning of Hajime\u2019s peer-to-peer infrastructure and passive, longitudinal collection of root DNS backscatter traffic\u2014we show that Hajime can be used as a lens into how IoT botnets operate, what kinds of devices they compromise, and what countries are more (or less) susceptible. Our results show that there are more compromised IoT devices than previously reported; that these devices use an assortment of CPU architectures, the popularity of which varies widely by country; that churn is high among IoT devices; and that new exploits can quickly and drastically increase the size and power of IoT botnets. Our code and data are available to assist future efforts to measure and mitigate the growing threat of IoT botnets.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Open TCP/UDP ports are traditionally used by servers to provide application services, but they are also found in many Android apps. In this paper, we present the \ufb01rst open-port analysis pipeline, covering the discovery, diagnosis, and security assessment, to systematically understand open ports in Android apps and their threats. We design and deploy a novel on-device crowdsourcing app and its server-side analytic engine to continuously monitor open ports in the wild. Over a period of ten months, we have collected over 40 million port monitoring records from 3,293 users in 136 countries worldwide, which allow us to observe the actual execution of open ports in 925 popular apps and 725 built-in system apps. The crowdsourcing also provides us a more accurate view of the pervasiveness of open ports in Android apps at 15.3%, much higher than the previous estimation of 6.8%. We also develop a new static diagnostic tool to reveal that 61.8% of the open-port apps are solely due to embedded SDKs, and 20.7% suffer from insecure API usages. Finally, we perform three security assessments of open ports: (i) vulnerability analysis revealing \ufb01ve vulnerability patterns in open ports of popular apps, e.g., Instagram, Samsung Gear, Skype, and the widely-embedded Facebook SDK, (ii) inter-device connectivity measurement in 224 cellular networks and 2,181 WiFi networks through crowdsourced network scans, and (iii) experimental demonstration of effective denial-of-service attacks against mobile open ports.",

        "title": "Ginseng: Keeping Secrets in Registers When You Distrust the Operating System",
        "abstract": "Many mobile and embedded apps possess sensitive data, or secrets. Trusting the operating system (OS), they often keep their secrets in the memory. Recent incidents have shown that the memory is not necessarily secure because the OS can be compromised due to inevitable vulnerabilities resulting from its sheer size and complexity. Existing solutions protect sensitive data against an untrusted OS by running app logic in the Secure world, a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) supported by the ARM TrustZone technology. Because app logic increases the attack surface of their TEE, these solutions do not work for third-party apps. This work aims to support third-party apps without growing the attack surface, significant development effort, or performance overhead. Our solution, called Ginseng, protects sensitive data by allocating them to registers at compile time and encrypting them at runtime before they enter the memory, due to function calls, exceptions or lack of physical registers. Ginseng does not run any app logic in the TEE and only requires minor markups to support existing apps. We report a prototype implementation based on LLVM, ARM Trusted Firmware (ATF), and the HiKey board. We evaluate it with both microbenchmarks and real-world secret-holding apps. Our evaluation shows Ginseng efficiently protects sensitive data with low engineering effort. For example, a Ginsengenabled web server, Nginx, protects the TLS master key with no measurable overhead. We find Ginseng\u2019s overhead is proportional to how often sensitive data in registers have to be encrypted and decrypted, i.e., spilling and restoring sensitive data on a function call or under high register pressure. As a result, Ginseng is most suited to protecting small sensitive data, like a password or social security number.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Synthetic biology is developing into a promising science and engineering \ufb01eld. One of the enabling technologies for this \ufb01eld is the DNA synthesizer. It allows researchers to custom-build sequences of oligonucleotides (short DNA strands) using the nucleobases: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T). Incorporating these sequences into organisms can result in improved disease resistance and lifespan for plants, animals, and humans. Hence, many laboratories spend large amounts of capital researching and developing unique sequences of oligonucleotides. However, these DNA synthesizers are fully automated systems with cyber-domain processes and physical domain components. Hence, they may be prone to security breaches like any other computing system. In our work, we present a novel acoustic side-channel attack methodology which can be used on DNA synthesizers to breach their con\ufb01dential-ity and steal valuable oligonucleotide sequences. Our proposed attack methodology achieves an average accuracy of 88.07% in predicting each base and is able to reconstruct short sequences with 100% accuracy by making less than 21 guesses out of 4 15 possibilities. We evaluate our attack against the effects of the microphone\u2019s distance from the DNA synthesizer and show that our attack methodology can achieve over 80% accuracy when the microphone is placed as far as 0.7 meters from the DNA synthesizer despite the presence of common room noise. In addition, we reconstruct DNA sequences to show how effectively an attacker with biomedical-domain knowledge would be able to derive the intended functionality of the sequence using the proposed attack methodology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst methodology that highlights the possibility of such an",

        "abstract": "\u2014Bluetooth is a widely used communication tech- nology, especially under the scenarios of mobile computing and Internet of Things. Once paired with a host device, a Bluetooth device then can exchange commands and data, such as voice, keyboard/mouse inputs, network, blood pressure data, and so on, with the host. Due to the sensitivity of such data and commands, some security measures have already been built into the Bluetooth protocol, like authentication, encryption, authorization, etc. However, according to our studies on the Bluetooth protocol as well as its implementation on Android system, we \ufb01nd that there are still some design \ufb02aws which could lead to serious security consequences. For example, it is found that the authentication process on Bluetooth pro\ufb01les is quite inconsistent and coarse- grained: if a paired device changes its pro\ufb01le, it automatically gets trust and users would not be noti\ufb01ed. Also, there is no strict veri\ufb01cation on the information provided by the Bluetooth device itself, so that a malicious device can deceive a user by changing its name, pro\ufb01le information, and icon to be displayed on the screen. To better understand the problem, we performed a systematic study over the Bluetooth pro\ufb01les and presented three attacks to demonstrate the feasibility and potential damages of such Bluetooth design \ufb02aws. The attacks were implemented on a Raspberry Pi 2 device and evaluated with different Android OS versions ranging from 5.1 to the latest 8.1. The results showed adversaries could bypass existing protections of Android (e.g., permissions, isolations, etc.), launch Man-in-the-Middle attack, control the victim apps and system, steal sensitive information, etc. To mitigate such threats, a new Bluetooth validation mechanism was proposed. We implemented the prototype system based on the AOSP project and deployed it on a Google Pixel 2 phone for evaluation. The experiment showed our solution could effectively prevent the attacks.",

This ensures program booting into system states that are free of persistent malware. An adversary can no longer retain undetected control of one\u2019s local system. We establish RoT unconditionally; i.e., without secrets, trusted hardware modules and instructions, or bounds on the adversary\u2019s computational power. The specification of a system\u2019s chipset and device controllers, and an external source of true random numbers, such as a commercially available quantum RNG, is all that is needed. Our system specifications are those of a concrete Word Random Access Machine (cWRAM) model \u2013 the closest computation model to a real system with a large instruction set. We define the requirements for RoT establishment and explain their differences from past attestation protocols. Then we introduce a RoT establishment protocol based on a new computation primitive with concrete (non-asymptotic) optimal space-time bounds in adversarial evaluation on the cWRAM. The new primitive is a randomized polynomial, which has kindependent uniform coefficients in a prime order field. Its collision properties are stronger than those of a k-independent (almost) universal hash function in cWRAM evaluations, and are sufficient to prove existence of malware-free states before RoT is established. Preliminary measurements show that randomizedpolynomial performance is practical on commodity hardware even for very large k. To prove the concrete optimality of randomized polynomials, we present a result of independent complexity interest: a Hornerrule program is uniquely optimal whenever the cWRAM execution space and time are simultaneously minimized.",

        "title": "Encrypted DNS -> Privacy? A Traffic Analysis Perspective",
        "abstract": "Virtually every connection to an Internet service is preceded by a DNS lookup which is performed without any traffic-level protection, thus enabling manipulation, redirection, surveillance, and censorship. To address these issues, large organizations such as Google and Cloudflare are deploying recently standardized protocols that encrypt DNS traffic between end users and recursive resolvers such as DNS-over-TLS (DoT) and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH). In this paper, we examine whether encrypting DNS traffic can protect users from traffic analysis-based monitoring and censoring. We propose a novel feature set to perform the attacks, as those used to attack HTTPS or Tor traffic are not suitable for DNS' characteristics. We show that traffic analysis enables the identification of domains with high accuracy in closed and open world settings, using 124 times less data than attacks on HTTPS flows. We find that factors such as location, resolver, platform, or client do mitigate the attacks performance but they are far from completely stopping them. Our results indicate that DNS-based censorship is still possible on encrypted DNS traffic. In fact, we demonstrate that the standardized padding schemes are not effective. Yet, Tor -- which does not effectively mitigate traffic analysis attacks on web traffic -- is a good defense against DoH traffic analysis.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Recently, the Spectre and Meltdown attacks revealed serious vulnerabilities in modern CPU designs, allowing an attacker to ex\ufb01ltrate data from sensitive programs. These vulnerabilities take advantage of speculative execution to coerce a processor to perform computation that would otherwise not occur, leaking the resulting information via side channels to an attacker. In this paper, we extend these ideas in a different direction, and leverage speculative execution in order to hide malware from both static and dynamic analysis. Using this technique, critical portions of a malicious program\u2019s computation can be shielded from view, such that even a debugger following an instruction-level trace of the program cannot tell how its results were computed. We introduce ExSpectre , which compiles arbitrary malicious code into a seemingly-benign payload binary. When a separate trigger program runs on the same machine, it mistrains the CPU\u2019s branch predictor, causing the payload program to speculatively execute its malicious payload, which communicates speculative results back to the rest of the payload program to change its real-world behavior.",

        "title": "DIAT: Data Integrity Attestation for Resilient Collaboration of Autonomous Systems",
        "abstract": "Networks of autonomous collaborative embedded systems are emerging in many application domains such as vehicular ad-hoc networks, robotic factory workers, search/rescue robots, delivery and search drones. To perform their collaborative tasks the involved devices exchange various types of information such as sensor data, status information, and commands. For the correct operation of these complex systems each device must be able to verify that the data coming from other devices is correct and has not been maliciously altered. In this paper, we present DIAT \u2013 a novel approach that allows to verify the correctness of data by attesting the correct generation as well as processing of data using control-flow attestation. DIAT enables devices in autonomous collaborative networks to securely and efficiently interact, relying on a minimal TCB. It ensures that the data sent from one device to another device is not maliciously changed, neither during transport nor during generation or processing on the originating device. Data exchanged between devices in the network is therefore authenticated along with a proof of integrity of all software involved in its generation and processing. To enable this, the embedded devices\u2019 software is decomposed into simple interacting modules reducing the amount and complexity of software that needs to be attested, i.e., only those modules that process the data are relevant. As a proof of concept we implemented and evaluated our scheme DIAT on a state-of-the-art flight controller for drones. Furthermore, we evaluated our scheme in a simulation environment to demonstrate its scalability for large-scale systems.",

        "abstract": "Embedded computing devices are used on a large scale in the emerging internet of things (IoT). However, their wide deployment raises the incentive for attackers to target these devices, as demonstrated by several recent attacks. As IoT devices are built for long service life, means are required to protect sensitive code in the presence of potential vulnerabilities, which might be discovered long after deployment. Tagged memory has been proposed as a mechanism to enforce various fine-grained security policies at runtime. However, none of the existing tagged memory schemes provides efficient and flexible compartmentalization in terms of isolated execution environments. We present TIMBER-V, a new tagged memory architecture featuring flexible and efficient isolation of code and data on small embedded systems. We overcome several limitations of previous schemes. We augment tag isolation with a memory protection unit to isolate individual processes, while maintaining low memory overhead. TIMBER-V significantly reduces the problem of memory fragmentation, and improves dynamic reuse of untrusted memory across security boundaries. TIMBER-V enables novel sharing of execution stacks across different security domains, in addition to interleaved heaps. TIMBER-V is compatible to existing code, supports real-time constraints and is open source. We show the efficiency of TIMBER-V by evaluating our proofof-concept implementation on the RISC-V simulator.",

        "abstract": "With the rise of IoT botnets, the remediation of infected devices has become a critical task. As over 87% of these devices reside in broadband networks, this task will fall primarily to consumers and the Internet Service Providers. We present the first empirical study of IoT malware cleanup in the wild -- more specifically, of removing Mirai infections in the network of a medium-sized ISP. To measure remediation rates, we combine data from an observational study and a randomized controlled trial involving 220 consumers who suffered a Mirai infection together with data from honeypots and darknets. We find that quarantining and notifying infected customers via a walled garden, a best practice from ISP botnet mitigation for conventional malware, remediates 92% of the infections within 14 days. Email-only notifications have no observable impact compared to a control group where no notifications were sent. We also measure surprisingly high natural remediation rates of 58-74% for this control group and for two reference networks where users were also not notified. Even more surprising, reinfection rates are low. Only 5% of the customers who remediated suffered another infection in the five months after our first study. This stands in contrast to our lab tests, which observed reinfection of real IoT devices within minutes -- a discrepancy for which we explore various different possible explanations, but find no satisfactory answer. We gather data on customer experiences and actions via 76 phone interviews and the communications logs of the ISP. Remediation succeeds even though many users are operating from the wrong mental model -- e.g., they run anti-virus software on their PC to solve the infection of an IoT device. While quarantining infected devices is clearly highly effective, future work will have to resolve several remaining mysteries. Furthermore, it will be hard to scale up the walled garden solution because of the weak incentives of the ISPs.",

        "title": "maTLS: How to Make TLS middlebox-aware?",
        "abstract": "\u2014Middleboxes are widely deployed in order to enhance security and performance in networking. As communication over TLS becomes increasingly common, however, the end-to-end channel model of TLS undermines the ef\ufb01cacy of middleboxes. Existing solutions, such as \u2018SplitTLS\u2019, which in-tercepts TLS sessions, often introduce signi\ufb01cant security risks by installing a custom root certi\ufb01cate or sharing a private key. Many studies have con\ufb01rmed security vulnerabilities when combining TLS with middleboxes, which include certi\ufb01cate validation failures, use of obsolete ciphersuites, and unwanted content modi\ufb01cation. To address the above issues, we introduce a middlebox-aware TLS protocol, dubbed maTLS, which allows middleboxes to participate in the TLS session in a visible and auditable fashion. Every participating middlebox now splits a session into two segments with their own security parameters in collaboration with the two endpoints. The maTLS protocol is designed to authenticate the middleboxes to verify the security parameters of segments, and to audit the middleboxes\u2019 write operations. Thus, security of the session is ensured. We prove the security model of maTLS by using Tamarin, a state-of-the-art security veri\ufb01cation tool. We also carry out testbed-based experiments to show that maTLS achieves the above security goals with marginal overhead.",

        "abstract": "The Dark Web is notorious for being a major distribution channel of harmful content as well as unlawful goods. Perpetrators have also used cryptocurrencies to conduct illicit financial transactions while hiding their identities. The limited coverage and outdated data of the Dark Web in previous studies motivated us to conduct an in-depth investigative study to understand how perpetrators abuse cryptocurrencies in the Dark Web. We designed and implemented MFScope, a new framework which collects Dark Web data, extracts cryptocurrency information, and analyzes their usage characteristics on the Dark Web. Specifically, MFScope collected more than 27 million dark webpages and extracted around 10 million unique cryptocurrency addresses for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Monero. It then classified their usages to identify trades of illicit goods and traced cryptocurrency money flows, to reveal black money operations on the Dark Web. In total, using MFScope we discovered that more than 80% of Bitcoin addresses on the Dark Web were used with malicious intent; their monetary volume was around 180 million USD, and they sent a large sum of their money to several popular cryptocurrency services (e.g., exchange services). Furthermore, we present two real-world unlawful services and demonstrate their Bitcoin transaction traces, which helps in understanding their marketing strategy as well as black money operations.",

Often the instantiations of OT require prohibitive communication and computation complexity. OT extension protocols are introduced to compute a very large number of OTs referred to as extended OTs at the cost of a small number of OTs referred to as seed OTs. \nWe present a fast OT extension protocol for small secrets in the active setting. Our protocol when used to produce 1-out-of-n OTs outperforms all the known actively secure OT extensions. Our protocol is built on the semi-honest secure extension protocol of Kolesnikov and Kumaresan of CRYPTO'13 (referred to as KK13 protocol henceforth) which is the best known OT extension for short secrets.",

        "abstract": "Decentralized cryptocurrencies rely on participants to keep track of the state of the system in order to verify new transactions. As the number of users and transactions grows, this requirement becomes a significant burden, requiring users to download, verify, and store a large amount of data to participate. Vault is a new cryptocurrency design based on Algorand that minimizes these storage and bootstrapping costs for participants. Vault\u2019s design is based on Algorand\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus protocol and uses several techniques to achieve its goals. First, Vault decouples the storage of recent transactions from the storage of account balances, which enables Vault to delete old account state. Second, Vault allows sharding state across participants in a way that preserves strong security guarantees. Finally, Vault introduces the notion of stamping certificates, which allow a new client to catch up securely and efficiently in a proofof-stake system without having to verify every single block. Experiments with a prototype implementation of Vault\u2019s data structures show that Vault\u2019s design reduces the bandwidth cost of joining the network as a full client by 99.7% compared to Bitcoin and 90.5% compared to Ethereum when downloading a ledger containing 500 million transactions.",

        "title": "Enemy At the Gateways: Censorship-Resilient Proxy Distribution Using Game Theory",
        "abstract": "A core technique used by popular proxy-based circumvention systems like Tor is to privately and selectively distribute the IP addresses of circumvention proxies among censored clients to keep them unknown to the censors. In Tor, for instance, such privately shared proxies are known as bridges. A key challenge to this mechanism is the insider attack problem: censoring agents can impersonate benign censored clients in order to learn (and then block) the privately shared circumvention proxies. To minimize the risks of the insider attack threat, in-thewild circumvention systems like Tor use various proxy assignment mechanisms in order to minimize the risk of proxy enumeration by the censors, while providing access to a large fraction of censored clients. Unfortunately, existing proxy assignment mechanisms (like the one used by Tor) are based on ad hoc heuristics that offer no theoretical guarantees and are easily evaded in practice. In this paper, we take a systematic approach to the problem of proxy distribution in circumvention systems by establishing a gametheoretic framework. We model the proxy assignment problem as a game between circumvention system operators and the censors, and use game theory to derive the optimal strategies of each of the parties. Using our framework, we derive the best (optimal) proxy assignment mechanism of a circumvention system like Tor in the presence of the strongest censorship adversary who takes her best censorship actions. We perform extensive simulations to evaluate our optimal proxy assignment algorithm under various adversarial and network settings. We show that the algorithm has superior performance compared to the state of the art, i.e., provides stronger resistance to censorship even against the strongest censorship adversary. Our study establishes a generic framework for optimal proxy assignment that can be applied to various types of circumvention systems and under various threat models. We conclude with lessons and recommendations for the design of proxy-based circumvention systems.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Broadly de\ufb01ned as the Internet of Things (IoT), the growth of commodity devices that integrate physical processes with digital connectivity has changed the way we live, play, and work. To date, the traditional approach to securing IoT has treated devices individually. However, in practice, it has been recently shown that the interactions among devices are often the real cause of safety and security violations. In this paper, we present I O TG UARD , a dynamic, policy-based enforcement system for IoT, which protects users from unsafe and insecure device states by monitoring the behavior of IoT and trigger-action platform apps. I O TG UARD operates in three phases: (a) implementation of a code instrumentor that adds extra logic to an app\u2019s source code to collect app\u2019s information at runtime, (b) storing the apps\u2019 information in a dynamic model that represents the runtime execution behavior of apps, and (c) identifying IoT safety and security policies, and enforcing relevant policies on the dynamic model of individual apps or sets of interacting apps. We demonstrate I O TG UARD on 20 \ufb02awed apps and \ufb01nd that I O TG UARD correctly enforces 12 of the 12 policy violations. In addition, we evaluate I O TG UARD on 35 SmartThings IoT and 30 IFTTT trigger-action platform market apps executed in a simulated smart home. I O TG UARD enforces 11 unique policies and blocks 16 states in six (17.1%) SmartThings and \ufb01ve (16.6%) IFTTT apps. I O TG UARD imposes only 17.3% runtime overhead on an app and 19.8% for \ufb01ve interacting apps. Through this effort, we introduce a rigorously grounded system for enforcing correct operation of IoT devices through systematically identi\ufb01ed IoT policies, demonstrating the effectiveness and value of monitoring IoT apps with tools such as I O TG UARD .",

        "abstract": "The Web has become highly interactive and an \nimportant driver for modern life, enabling information retrieval, \nsocial exchange, and online shopping. From the security perspective, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is one of the most nefarious \nattacks against Web clients. Research has long since focused \non three categories of XSS: Reflected, Persistent, and DOMbased XSS. In this paper, we argue that our community must \nconsider at least four important classes of XSS, and present \nthe first systematic study of the threat of Persistent Client-Side \nXSS, caused by the insecure use of client-side storage. While \nthe existence of this class has been acknowledged, especially by \nthe non-academic community like OWASP, prior works have \neither only found such flaws as side effects of other analyses or \nfocused on a limited set of applications to analyze. Therefore, the \ncommunity lacks in-depth knowledge about the actual prevalence \nof Persistent Client-Side XSS in the wild. \nTo close this research gap, we leverage taint tracking to \nidentify suspicious flows from client-side persistent storage (Web \nStorage, cookies) to dangerous sinks (HTML, JavaScript, and \nscript.src). We discuss two attacker models capable of \ninjecting malicious payloads into storage, i.e., a Network Attacker \ncapable of temporarily hijacking HTTP communication (e.g., in \na public WiFi), and a Web Attacker who can leverage flows into \nstorage or an existing reflected XSS flaw to persist their payload. \nWith our taint-aware browser and these models in mind, we \nstudy the prevalence of Persistent Client-Side XSS in the Alexa \nTop 5,000 domains. We find that more than 8% of them have \nunfiltered data flows from persistent storage to a dangerous sink, \nwhich showcases the developers\u2019 inherent trust in the integrity \nof storage content. Even worse, if we only consider sites that \nmake use of data originating from storage, 21% of the sites are \nvulnerable. For those sites with vulnerable flows from storage \nto sink, we find that at least 70% are directly exploitable by \nour attacker models. Finally, investigating the vulnerable flows \noriginating from storage allows us to categorize them into four \ndisjoint categories and propose appropriate mitigations.",

        "title": "SANCTUARY: ARMing TrustZone with User-space Enclaves",
        "abstract": "ARM TrustZone is one of the most widely deployed security architecture providing Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Unfortunately, its usage and potential benefits for application developers and end users are largely limited due to restricted deployment policies imposed by device vendors. Restriction is enforced since every Trusted App (TA) increases the TEE\u2019s attack surface: any vulnerable or malicious TA can compromise the system\u2019s security. Hence, deploying a TA requires mutual trust between device vendor and application developer, incurring high costs for both. Vendors work around this by offering interfaces to selected TEE functionalities, however, these are not sufficient to securely implement advanced mobile services like banking. Extensive discussion of Intel\u2019s SGX technology in academia and industry has unveiled the demand for an unrestricted use of TEEs, yet no comparable security architecture for mobile devices exists to this day. We propose SANCTUARY, the first security architecture which allows unconstrained use of TEEs in the TrustZone ecosystem without relying on virtualization. SANCTUARY enables execution of security-sensitive apps within strongly isolated compartments in TrustZone\u2019s normal world comparable to SGX\u2019s user-space enclaves. In particular, we leverage TrustZone\u2019s versatile AddressSpace Controller available in current ARM System-on-Chip reference designs, to enforce two-way hardware-level isolation: (i) security-sensitive apps are shielded against a compromised normal-world OS, while (ii) the system is also protected from potentially malicious apps in isolated compartments. Moreover, moving security-sensitive apps from the TrustZone\u2019s secure world to isolated compartments minimizes the TEE\u2019s attack surface. Thus, mutual trust relationships between device vendors and developers become obsolete: the full potential of TEEs can be leveraged. We demonstrate practicality and real-world benefits of SANCTUARY by thoroughly evaluating our prototype on a HiKey 960 development board with microbenchmarks and a use case for one-time password generation in two-factor authentication.",

        "title": "TEE-aided Write Protection Against Privileged Data Tampering",
        "abstract": "Unauthorized data alteration has been a longstanding threat since the emergence of malware. System and application software can be reinstalled and hardware can be replaced, but user data is priceless in many cases. Especially in recent years, ransomware has become high-impact due to its direct monetization model. State-of-the-art defenses are mostly based on known signature or behavior analysis, and more importantly, require an uncompromised OS kernel. However, malware with the highest software privileges has shown its obvious existence. We propose to move from current detection/recovery based mechanisms to data loss prevention, where the focus is on armoring data instead of counteracting malware. Our solution, Inuksuk, relies on today's Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), as available both on the CPU and storage device, to achieve programmable write protection. We back up a copy of user-selected files as write-protected at all times, and subsequent updates are written as new versions securely through TEE. We implement Inuksuk on Windows 7 and 10, and Linux (Ubuntu); our core design is OS and application agnostic, and incurs no run-time performance penalty for applications. File transfer disruption can be eliminated or alleviated through access modes and customizable update policies (e.g., interval, granularity). For Inuksuk's adoptability in modern OSes, we have also ported Flicker (EuroSys 2008), a defacto standard tool for in-OS privileged TEE management, to the latest 64-bit Windows.",

        "abstract": "The advancement of molecular profiling techniques \nfuels biomedical research with a deluge of data. To facilitate \ndata sharing, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health \nestablished the Beacon system, a search engine designed to help \nresearchers find datasets of interest. While the current Beacon \nsystem only supports genomic data, other types of biomedical \ndata, such as DNA methylation, are also essential for advancing \nour understanding in the field. In this paper, we propose the first \nBeacon system for DNA methylation data sharing: MBeacon. As \nthe current genomic Beacon is vulnerable to privacy attacks, such \nas membership inference, and DNA methylation data is highly \nsensitive, we take a privacy-by-design approach to construct \nMBeacon. \nFirst, we demonstrate the privacy threat, by proposing a \nmembership inference attack tailored specifically to unprotected \nmethylation Beacons. Our experimental results show that 100 \nqueries are sufficient to achieve a successful attack with AUC \n(area under the ROC curve) above 0.9. To remedy this situation, \nwe propose a novel differential privacy mechanism, namely SVT2 \n, \nwhich is the core component of MBeacon. Extensive experiments \nover multiple datasets show that SVT2 \ncan successfully mitigate \nmembership privacy risks without significantly harming utility. \nWe further implement a fully functional prototype of MBeacon \nwhich we make available to the research community",

        "abstract": "A good security practice for handling sensitive data, such as passwords, is to overwrite the data buffers with zeros once the data is no longer in use. This protects against attackers who gain a snapshot of a device\u2019s physical memory, whether by inperson physical attacks, or by remote attacks like Meltdown and Spectre. This paper looks at unnecessary password retention in Android phones by popular apps, secure password management apps, and even the lockscreen system process. We have performed a comprehensive analysis of the Android framework and a variety of apps, and discovered that passwords can survive in a variety of locations, including UI widgets where users enter their passwords, apps that retain passwords rather than exchange them for tokens, old copies not yet reused by garbage collectors, and buffers in keyboard apps. We have developed solutions that successfully fix these problems with modest code changes.",

        "abstract": "The exposure of location data constitutes a significant privacy risk to users as it can lead to de-anonymization, the inference of sensitive information, and even physical threats. In this paper we present LPAuditor, a tool that conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the privacy loss caused by publicly available location metadata. First, we demonstrate how our system can pinpoint users' key locations at an unprecedented granularity by identifying their actual postal addresses. Our experimental evaluation on Twitter data highlights the effectiveness of our techniques which outperform prior approaches by 18.9%-91.6% for homes and 8.7%-21.8% for workplaces. Next we present a novel exploration of automated private information inference that uncovers \"sensitive\" locations that users have visited (pertaining to health, religion, and sex/nightlife). We find that location metadata can provide additional context to tweets and thus lead to the exposure of private information that might not match the users' intentions. \nWe further explore the mismatch between user actions and information exposure and find that older versions of the official Twitter apps follow a privacy-invasive policy of including precise GPS coordinates in the metadata of tweets that users have geotagged at a coarse-grained level (e.g., city). The implications of this exposure are further exacerbated by our finding that users are considerably privacy-cautious in regards to exposing precise location data. When users can explicitly select what location data is published, there is a 94.6% reduction in tweets with GPS coordinates. As part of current efforts to give users more control over their data, LPAuditor can be adopted by major services and offered as an auditing tool that informs users about sensitive information they (indirectly) expose through location metadata.",

        "abstract": "Research has produced many types of authentication systems that use machine learning. However, there is no consistent approach for reporting performance metrics and the reported metrics are inadequate. In this work, we show that several of the common metrics used for reporting performance, such as maximum accuracy (ACC), equal error rate (EER) and area under the ROC curve (AUROC), are inherently flawed. These common metrics hide the details of the inherent tradeoffs a system must make when implemented. Our findings show that current metrics give no insight into how system performance degrades outside the ideal conditions in which they were designed. We argue that adequate performance reporting must be provided to enable meaningful evaluation and that current, commonly used approaches fail in this regard. We present the unnormalized frequency count of scores (FCS) to demonstrate the mathematical underpinnings that lead to these failures and show how they can be avoided. The FCS can be used to augment the performance reporting to enable comparison across systems in a visual way. When reported with the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (ROC), these two metrics provide a solution to the limitations of currently reported metrics. Finally, we show how to use the FCS and ROC metrics to evaluate and compare different authentication systems.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Tremendous growth in cryptocurrency usage is exposing the inherent scalability issues with permis-sionless blockchain technology. Payment-channel networks (PCNs) have emerged as the most widely deployed solution to mitigate the scalability issues, allowing the bulk of payments between two users to be carried out off-chain. Unfortunately, as reported in the literature and further demonstrated in this paper, current PCNs do not provide meaningful security and privacy guarantees [30], [40]. In this work, we study and design secure and privacy-preserving PCNs. We start with a security analysis of existing PCNs, reporting a new attack that applies to all major PCNs, including the Lightning Network, and allows an attacker to steal the fees from honest intermediaries in the same payment path. We then formally de\ufb01ne anonymous multi-hop locks (AMHLs), a novel cryptographic primitive that serves as a cornerstone for the design of secure and privacy-preserving PCNs. We present several provably secure cryptographic instantiations that make AMHLs compatible with the vast majority of cryptocurrencies. In particular, we show that (linear) homomorphic one-way functions suf\ufb01ce to construct AMHLs for PCNs supporting a script language (e.g., Ethereum). We also propose a construction based on ECDSA signatures that does not require scripts , thus solving a prominent open problem in the \ufb01eld.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Enterprises own a signi\ufb01cant fraction of the hosts connected to the Internet and possess valuable assets, such as \ufb01nancial data and intellectual property, which may be targeted by attackers. They suffer attacks that exploit unpatched hosts and install malware, resulting in breaches that may cost millions in damages. Despite the scale of this phenomenon, the threat and vulnerability landscape of enterprises remains under-studied. The security posture of enterprises remains unclear, and it\u2019s unknown whether enterprises are indeed more secure than consumer hosts. To address these questions, we perform the largest and longest enterprise security study up to date. Our data covers nearly 3 years and is collected from 28K enterprises, belonging to 67 industries, which own 82M hosts and 73M public-facing servers. Our measurements comprise of two parts: an analysis of the threat landscape and an analysis of the enterprise vulnerability patching behavior. The threat landscape analysis \ufb01rst classi\ufb01es low reputation \ufb01les observed in enterprise hosts into families. Then, it measures, among others, that 91%\u201397% of the enterprises, 13%\u201341% of the enterprise hosts, encountered at least one malware or PUP \ufb01le over the length of our study; that enterprises encounter malware much more often than PUP; and that some industries like banks and consumer \ufb01nances are doing notoriously better, achieving signi\ufb01cantly lower malware and PUP encounter rates than the most-affected industries. The vulnerability analysis examines the patching of 12 client-side and 112 server-side applications in enterprise hosts and servers. It measures, among others, that it takes over 6 months on average to patch 90% of the population across all vulnerabilities in the 12 client-side applications; that enterprise computers are faster to patch vulnerabilities compared to consumer hosts; and that the patching of server applications is much worse than the patching of client-side applications.",

        "title": "CRCount: Pointer Invalidation with Reference Counting to Mitigate Use-after-free in Legacy C/C++",
        "abstract": "Pointer invalidation has been a popular approach adopted in many recent studies to mitigate use-after-free errors. The approach can be divided largely into two different schemes: explicit invalidation and implicit invalidation. The former aims to eradicate the root cause of use-after-free errors by explicitly invalidating every dangling pointer. In contrast, the latter aims to prevent dangling pointers by freeing an object only if there is no pointer referring to it. A downside of the explicit scheme is that it is expensive, as it demands high-cost algorithms or a large amount of space to maintain up-to-date lists of pointer locations linking to each object. Implicit invalidation is more efficient in that even without any explicit effort, it can eliminate dangling pointers by leaving objects undeleted until all the links between the objects and their referring pointers vanish by themselves during program execution. However, such an argument only holds if the scheme knows exactly when each link is created and deleted. Reference counting is a traditional method to determine the existence of reference links between objects and pointers. Unfortunately, impeccable reference counting for legacy C/C++ code is very difficult and expensive to achieve in practice, mainly because of the type unsafe operations in the code. In this paper, we present a solution, called CRCount, to the use-after-free problem in legacy C/C++. For effective and efficient problem solving, CRCount is armed with the pointer footprinting technique that enables us to compute, with high accuracy, the reference count of every object referred to by the pointers in the legacy code. Our experiments demonstrate that CRCount mitigates the useafter-free errors with a lower performance-wise and space-wise overhead than the existing pointer invalidation solutions.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Recent market share statistics show that mobile device traf\ufb01c has overtaken that of traditional desktop computers. Users spend an increasing amount of time on their smartphones and tablets, while the web continues to be the platform of choice for delivering new applications to users. In this environment, it is necessary for web applications to utilize all the tools at their disposal to protect mobile users against popular web application attacks. In this paper, we perform the \ufb01rst study of the support of popular web-application security mechanisms (such as the Content-Security Policy, HTTP Strict Transport Security, and Referrer Policy) across mobile browsers. We design 395 individual tests covering 8 different security mechanisms, and utilize them to evaluate the security-mechanism support in the 20 most popular browser families on Android. Moreover, by collecting and testing browser versions from the last seven years, we evaluate a total of 351 unique browser versions against the aforementioned tests, collecting more than 138K test results. By analyzing these results, we \ufb01nd that, although mobile browsers generally support more security mechanisms over time, not all browsers evolve in the same way. We discover popular browsers, with millions of downloads, which do not support the majority of the tested mechanisms, and identify design choices, followed by the majority of browsers, which leave hundreds of popular websites open to clickjacking attacks. Moreover, we discover the presence of multi-year vulnerability windows between the time when popular websites start utilizing a security mechanism and when mobile browsers enforce it. Our \ufb01ndings highlight the need for continuous security testing of mobile web browsers, as well as server-side frameworks which can adapt to the level of security that each browser can guarantee.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are vulnerable to adversarial samples that are generated by perturbing correctly classi\ufb01ed inputs to cause DNN models to misbehave (e.g., misclas-si\ufb01cation). This can potentially lead to disastrous consequences especially in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense and detection techniques work well for speci\ufb01c attacks under various assumptions (e.g., the set of possible attacks are known beforehand). However, they are not suf\ufb01ciently general to protect against a broader range of attacks. In this paper, we analyze the internals of DNN models under various attacks and identify two common exploitation channels: the provenance channel and the activation value distribution channel. We then propose a novel technique to extract DNN invariants and use them to perform runtime adversarial sample detection. Our experimental results of 11 different kinds of attacks on popular datasets including ImageNet and 13 models show that our technique can effectively detect all these attacks (over 90% accuracy) with limited false positives. We also compare it with three state-of-the-art techniques including the Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) based method, denoiser based methods (i.e., MagNet and HGD), and the prediction inconsistency based approach (i.e., feature squeezing). Our experiments show promising results.",

        "abstract": "Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for program analysis. However, it has many limitations in practical applicability: the path explosion problem encumbers scalability, the need for language-specific implementation, the inability to handle complex dependencies, and the limited expressiveness of theories supported by underlying satisfiability checkers. Often, relationships between variables of interest are not expressible directly as purely symbolic constraints. To this end, we present a new approach\u2014neuro-symbolic execution\u2014which learns an approximation of the relationship between program values of interest, as a neural network. We develop a procedure for checking satisfiability of mixed constraints, involving both symbolic expressions and neural representations. We implement our new approach in a tool called NEUEX as an extension of KLEE, a state-of-the-art dynamic symbolic execution engine. NEUEX finds 33 exploits in a benchmark of 7 programs within 12 hours. This is an improvement in the bug finding efficacy of 94% over vanilla KLEE. We show that this new approach drives execution down difficult paths on which KLEE and other DSE extensions get stuck, eliminating limitations of purely SMT-based techniques.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Widely reported privacy issues concerning major online advertising platforms (e.g., Facebook) have heightened concerns among users about the data that is collected about them. However, while we have a comprehensive understanding who collects data on users, as well as how tracking is implemented, there is still a signi\ufb01cant gap in our understanding: what information do advertisers actually infer about users, and is this information accurate? In this study, we leverage Ad Preference Managers ( APMs ) as a lens through which to address this gap. APMs are transparency tools offered by some advertising platforms that allow users to see the interest pro\ufb01les that are constructed about them. We recruited 220 participants to install an IRB approved browser extension that collected their interest pro\ufb01les from four APMs (Google, Facebook, Oracle BlueKai, and Neilsen eXelate), as well as behavioral and survey data. We use this data to analyze the size and correctness of interest pro\ufb01les, compare their composition across the four platforms, and investigate the origins of the data underlying these pro\ufb01les.",

        "abstract": "Hybrid fuzzing which combines fuzzing and concolic execution has become an advanced technique for software vulnerability detection. Based on the observation that fuzzing and concolic execution are complementary in nature, the stateof-the-art hybrid fuzzing systems deploy \u201cdemand launch\u201d and \u201coptimal switch\u201d strategies. Although these ideas sound intriguing, we point out several fundamental limitations in them, due to oversimplified assumptions. We then propose a novel \u201cdiscriminative dispatch\u201d strategy to better utilize the capability of concolic execution. We design a novel Monte Carlo based probabilistic path prioritization model to quantify each path\u2019s difficulty and prioritize them for concolic execution. This model treats fuzzing as a random sampling process. It calculates each path\u2019s probability based on the sampling information. Finally, our model prioritizes and assigns the most difficult paths to concolic execution. We implement a prototype system DigFuzz and evaluate our system with two representative datasets. Results show that the concolic execution in DigFuzz outperforms than those in state-of-the-art hybrid fuzzing systems in every major aspect. In particular, the concolic execution in DigFuzz contributes to discovering more vulnerabilities (12 vs. 5) and producing more code coverage (18.9% vs. 3.8%) on the CQE dataset than the concolic execution in Driller.",

        "abstract": "Operating systems use shared memory to improve performance. However, as shown in recent studies, attackers can exploit CPU cache side-channels associated with shared memory to extract sensitive information. The attacks that were previously attempted typically only detect the presence of a certain operation and require significant manual analysis to identify and evaluate their effectiveness. Moreover, very few of them target graphics libraries which are commonly used, but difficult to attack. In this paper, we consider the execution time of shared libraries as the side-channel, and showcase a completely automated technique to discover and select exploitable side-channels on shared graphics libraries. In essence, we first collect the cache lines accessed by a victim process during different key presses offline, and then use machine learning to infer the best cache lines (e.g., easily measurable, robust to noise, high information leakage) for a flush and reload attack. We are able to discover effective strategies to classify what keys have been pressed. Using this approach, we not only preclude the need for manual analyses of code and traces \u2014 the automated system discovered many previously unknown sidechannels of the type we are interested in, but also achieve high precision in terms of inferring the sensitive information entered on desktop and Android platforms. We show that our approach infers the passwords with lowercase letters and numbers 10,000 1,000,000 times faster than random guessing. For a large fraction of PINs consisting of 4 to 6 digits, we are able to infer them within 20 and 80 guesses respectively. Finally, we suggest ways to mitigate these attacks.",

        "title": "One Engine To Serve 'em All: Inferring Taint Rules Without Architectural Semantics",
        "abstract": "Dynamic binary taint analysis has wide applications in the security analysis of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) binaries. One of the key challenges in dynamic binary analysis is to specify the taint rules that capture how taint information propagates for each instruction on an architecture. Most of the existing solutions specify taint rules using a deductive approach by summarizing the rules manually after analyzing the instruction semantics. Intuitively, taint propagation reflects on how an instruction input affects its output, and thus can be observed from instruction executions. In this work, we propose an inductive method for taint propagation and develop a universal taint tracking engine that is architecture-agnostic. Our taint engine, TAINTINDUCE, can learn taint rules with minimal architectural knowledge by observing the execution behavior of instructions. To measure its correctness and guide taint rule generation, we define the precise notion of soundness for bit-level taint tracking in this novel setup. In our evaluation, we show that TAINTINDUCE automatically learns rules for 4 widely used architectures: x86, x64, AArch64, and MIPS-I. It can detect vulnerabilities for 24 CVEs in 15 applications on both Linux and Windows over millions of instructions and is comparable with other mature existing tools (TEMU [51], libdft [32], Triton [42]). TAINTINDUCE can be used as a stand-alone taint engine or be used to complement existing taint engines for unhandled instructions. Further, it can be used as a cross-referencing tool to uncover bugs in taint engines, emulation implementations and ISA documentations.",

The proof-of-work blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, have been shown both theoretically and empirically vulnerable to double spending attacks. This is why Byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithms have gained popularity in the blockchain context for their ability to tolerate a limited number t of attackers among n participants. We formalize the recently proposed proof-of-authority consensus algorithms that are Byzantine fault tolerant by describing the Aura and Clique protocols present in the two mainstream implementations of Ethereum. We then introduce the Cloning Attack and show how to apply it to double spend in each of these protocols with a single malicious node. Our results show that the Cloning Attack against Aura is always successful while the same attack against Clique is about twice as fast and succeeds in most cases.",

We consider a hybrid paradigm in which a client-side device (such as a co-processor or trusted enclave) performs secure computation, while interacting with a public ledger via a possibly malicious host computer. We explore both the constructive and potentially destructive implications of such systems. We first show that this combination allows for the construction of stateful interactive functionalities (including general computation) even when the device has no persistent storage; this allows us to build sophisticated applications using inexpensive trusted hardware or even pure cryptographic obfuscation techniques. We further show how to use this paradigm to achieve censorship-resistant communication with a network, even when network communications are mediated by a potentially malicious host. Finally we describe a number of practical applications that can be achieved today. These include the synchronization of private smart contracts; rate limited mandatory logging; strong encrypted backups from weak passwords; enforcing fairness in multi-party computation; and destructive applications such as autonomous ransomware, which allows for payments without an online party.",

        "title": "Cross-Origin State Inference (COSI) Attacks: Leaking Web Site States through XS-Leaks",
        "abstract": "In a Cross-Origin State Inference (COSI) attack, an attacker convinces a victim into visiting an attack web page, which leverages the cross-origin interaction features of the victim's web browser to infer the victim's state at a target web site. Multiple instances of COSI attacks have been found in the past under different names such as login detection or access detection attacks. But, those attacks only consider two states (e.g., logged in or not) and focus on a specific browser leak method (or XS-Leak). This work shows that mounting more complex COSI attacks such as deanonymizing the owner of an account, determining if the victim owns sensitive content, and determining the victim's account type often requires considering more than two states. Furthermore, robust attacks require supporting a variety of browsers since the victim's browser cannot be predicted apriori. To address these issues, we present a novel approach to identify and build complex COSI attacks that differentiate more than two states and support multiple browsers by combining multiple attack vectors, possibly using different XS-Leaks. To enable our approach, we introduce the concept of a COSI attack class. We propose two novel techniques to generalize existing COSI attack instances into COSI attack classes and to discover new COSI attack classes. We systematically apply our techniques to existing attacks, identifying 40 COSI attack classes. As part of this process, we discover a novel XS-Leak based on window.postMessage. We implement our approach into Basta-COSI, a tool to find COSI attacks in a target web site. We apply Basta-COSI to test four stand-alone web applications and 58 popular web sites, finding COSI attacks against each of them.",

        "title": "Automating Patching of Vulnerable Open-Source Software Versions in Application Binaries",
        "abstract": "Mobile application developers rely heavily on opensource software (OSS) to offload common functionalities such as the implementation of protocols and media format playback. Over the past years, several vulnerabilities have been found in popular open-source libraries like OpenSSL and FFmpeg. Mobile applications that include such libraries inherit these flaws, which make them vulnerable. Fortunately, the open-source community is responsive and patches are made available within days. However, mobile application developers are often left unaware of these flaws. The App Security Improvement Program (ASIP) is a commendable effort by Google to notify application developers of these flaws, but recent work has shown that many developers do not act on this information. Our work addresses vulnerable mobile applications through automatic binary patching from source patches provided by the OSS maintainers and without involving the developers. We propose novel techniques to overcome difficult challenges like patching feasibility analysis, source-code-to-binary-code matching, and in-memory patching. Our technique uses a novel variabilityaware approach, which we implement as OSSPATCHER. We evaluated OSSPATCHER with 39 OSS and a collection of 1,000 Android applications using their vulnerable versions. OSSPATCHER generated 675 function-level patches that fixed the affected mobile applications without breaking their binary code. Further, we evaluated 10 vulnerabilities in popular apps such as Chrome with public exploits, which OSSPATCHER was able to mitigate and thwart their exploitation.",

        "title": "Broken Metre: Attacking Resource Metering in EVM",
        "abstract": "Blockchain systems, such as Ethereum, use an approach called \"metering\" to assign a cost to smart contract execution, an approach which is designed to incentivise miners to operate the network and protect it against DoS attacks. In the past, the imperfections of Ethereum metering allowed several DoS attacks which were countered through modification of the metering mechanism. \nThis paper presents a new DoS attack on Ethereum which systematically exploits its metering mechanism. We first replay and analyse several months of transactions, during which we discover a number of discrepancies in the metering model, such as significant inconsistencies in the pricing of the instructions. We further demonstrate that there is very little correlation between the execution cost and the utilised resources, such as CPU and memory. Based on these observations, we present a new type of DoS attack we call Resource Exhaustion Attack, which uses these imperfections to generate low-throughput contracts. To do this, we design a genetic algorithm that generates contracts with a throughput on average 200 times slower than typical contracts. We then show that all major Ethereum client implementations are vulnerable and, if running on commodity hardware, would be unable to stay in sync with the network when under attack. We argue that such an attack could be financially attractive not only for Ethereum competitors and speculators, but also for Ethereum miners. Finally, we discuss short-term and potential long-term fixes against such attacks. Our attack has been responsibly disclosed to the Ethereum Foundation and awarded a bug bounty reward of 5,000 USD.",

        "abstract": "Local Differential Privacy (LDP) protects user privacy from the data collector. LDP protocols have been increasingly deployed in the industry. A basic building block is frequency oracle (FO) protocols, which estimate frequencies of values. While several FO protocols have been proposed, the design goal does not lead to optimal results for answering many queries. In this paper, we show that adding post-processing steps to FO protocols by exploiting the knowledge that all individual frequencies should be non-negative and they sum up to one can lead to significantly better accuracy for a wide range of tasks, including frequencies of individual values, frequencies of the most frequent values, and frequencies of subsets of values. We consider 10 different methods that exploit this knowledge differently. We establish theoretical relationships between some of them and conducted extensive experimental evaluations to understand which methods should be used for different query tasks.",

        "title": "Practical Hidden Voice Attacks against Speech and Speaker Recognition Systems",
        "abstract": "Voice Processing Systems (VPSes), now widely deployed, have been made significantly more accurate through the application of recent advances in machine learning. However, adversarial machine learning has similarly advanced and has been used to demonstrate that VPSes are vulnerable to the injection of hidden commands - audio obscured by noise that is correctly recognized by a VPS but not by human beings. Such attacks, though, are often highly dependent on white-box knowledge of a specific machine learning model and limited to specific microphones and speakers, making their use across different acoustic hardware platforms (and thus their practicality) limited. In this paper, we break these dependencies and make hidden command attacks more practical through model-agnostic (blackbox) attacks, which exploit knowledge of the signal processing algorithms commonly used by VPSes to generate the data fed into machine learning systems. Specifically, we exploit the fact that multiple source audio samples have similar feature vectors when transformed by acoustic feature extraction algorithms (e.g., FFTs). We develop four classes of perturbations that create unintelligible audio and test them against 12 machine learning models, including 7 proprietary models (e.g., Google Speech API, Bing Speech API, IBM Speech API, Azure Speaker API, etc), and demonstrate successful attacks against all targets. Moreover, we successfully use our maliciously generated audio samples in multiple hardware configurations, demonstrating effectiveness across both models and real systems. In so doing, we demonstrate that domain-specific knowledge of audio signal processing represents a practical means of generating successful hidden voice command attacks.",

        "abstract": "SPEculative Execution side Channel Hardware (SPEECH) Vulnerabilities have enabled the notorious Meltdown, Spectre, and L1 terminal fault (L1TF) attacks. While a number of studies have reported different variants of SPEECH vulnerabilities, they are still not well understood. This is primarily due to the lack of information about microprocessor implementation details that impact the timing and order of various micro-architectural events. Moreover, to date, there is no systematic approach to quantitatively measure SPEECH vulnerabilities on commodity processors. This paper introduces SPEECHMINER, a software framework for exploring and measuring SPEECH vulnerabilities in an automated manner. SPEECHMINER empirically establishes the link between a novel two-phase fault handling model and the exploitability and speculation windows of SPEECH vulnerabilities. It enables testing of a comprehensive list of exception-triggering instructions under the same software framework, which leverages covert-channel techniques and differential tests to gain visibility into the micro-architectural state changes. We evaluated SPEECHMINER on 9 different processor types, examined 21 potential vulnerability variants, confirmed various known attacks, and identified several new variants.",

        "abstract": "\u2014 We discuss how symbolic execution can be used to not only \ufb01nd low-level errors but also analyze the semantic correctness of protocol implementations. To avoid manually crafting test cases, we propose a strategy of meta-level search, which leverages constraints stemmed from the input formats to automatically generate concolic test cases. Additionally, to aid root-cause analysis, we develop constraint provenance tracking (CPT), a mechanism that associates atomic sub-formulas of path constraints with their corresponding source level origins. We demonstrate the power of symbolic analysis with a case study on PKCS#1 v1.5 signature veri\ufb01cation. Leveraging meta-level search and CPT, we analyzed 15 recent open-source implementations using symbolic execution and found semantic \ufb02aws in 6 of them. Further analysis of these \ufb02aws showed that 4 implementations are susceptible to new variants of the Bleichenbacher low-exponent RSA signature forgery. One implementation suffers from potential denial of service attacks with purposefully crafted signatures. All our \ufb01ndings have been responsibly shared with the affected vendors. Among the \ufb02aws discovered, 6 new CVEs have been assigned to the immediately exploitable ones.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain networks, especially cryptocurrencies, rely heavily on proof-of-work (PoW) systems, often as a basis to distribute rewards. These systems require solving specific puzzles, where Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) can be designed for performance or efficiency. Either way, ASICs surpass CPUs and GPUs by orders of magnitude, and may harm blockchain networks. Recently, Equihash is developed to resist ASIC solving with heavy memory usage. Although commercial ASIC solvers exist for its most popular parameter set, such solvers do not work under better ones, and are considered impossible under optimal parameters. In this paper, we inspect the ASIC resistance of Equihash by constructing a parameterindependent adversary solver design. We evaluate the product, and project at least 10x efficiency advantage for resourceful adversaries. We contribute to the security community in two ways: (1) by revealing the limitation of Equihash and raising awareness about its algorithmic factors, and (2) by demonstrating that security inspection is practical and useful on PoW systems, serving as a start point for future research and development.",

        "abstract": "JavaScript engines are an attractive target for attackers due to their popularity and flexibility in building exploits. Current state-of-the-art fuzzers for finding JavaScript engine vulnerabilities focus mainly on generating syntactically correct test cases based on either a predefined context-free grammar or a trained probabilistic language model. Unfortunately, syntactically correct JavaScript sentences are often semantically invalid at runtime. Furthermore, statically analyzing the semantics of JavaScript code is challenging due to its dynamic nature: JavaScript code is generated at runtime, and JavaScript expressions are dynamically-typed. To address this challenge, we propose a novel test case generation algorithm that we call semantics-aware assembly, and implement it in a fuzz testing tool termed CodeAlchemist. Our tool can generate arbitrary JavaScript code snippets that are both semantically and syntactically correct, and it effectively yields test cases that can crash JavaScript engines. We found numerous vulnerabilities of the latest JavaScript engines with CodeAlchemist and reported them to the vendors.",

        "title": "Cracking the Wall of Confinement: Understanding and Analyzing Malicious Domain Take-downs",
        "abstract": "Take-down operations aim to disrupt cybercrime involving malicious domains. In the past decade, many successful take-down operations have been reported, including those against the Conficker worm, and most recently, against VPNFilter. Although it plays an important role in fighting cybercrime, the domain take-down procedure is still surprisingly opaque. There seems to be no in-depth understanding about how the take-down operation works and whether there is due diligence to ensure its security and reliability. In this paper, we report the first systematic study on domain takedown. Our study was made possible via a large collection of data, including various sinkhole feeds and blacklists, passive DNS data spanning six years, and historical WHOIS information. Over these datasets, we built a unique methodology that extensively used various reverse lookups and other data analysis techniques to address the challenges in identifying taken-down domains, sinkhole operators, and take-down durations. Applying the methodology on the data, we discovered over 620K takendown domains and conducted a longitudinal analysis on the take-down process, thus facilitating a better understanding of the operation and its weaknesses. We found that more than 14% of domains taken-down over the past ten months have been released back to the domain market and that some of the released domains have been repurchased by the malicious actor again before being captured and seized, either by the same or different sinkholes. In addition, we showed that the misconfiguration of DNS records corresponding to the sinkholed domains allowed us to hijack a domain that was seized by the FBI. Further, we found that expired sinkholes have caused the transfer of around 30K takendown domains whose traffic is now under the control of new owners.",

        "title": "Latex Gloves: Protecting Browser Extensions from Probing and Revelation Attacks",
        "abstract": "Browser extensions enable rich experience for the users of today's web. Being deployed with elevated privileges, extensions are given the power to overrule web pages. As a result, web pages often seek to detect the installed extensions, sometimes for benign adoption of their behavior but sometimes as part of privacy-violating user fingerprinting. Researchers have studied a class of attacks that allow detecting extensions by probing for Web Accessible Resources (WARs) via URLs that include public extension IDs. Realizing privacy risks associated with WARs, Firefox has recently moved to randomize a browser extension's ID, prompting the Chrome team to plan for following the same path. However, rather than mitigating the issue, the randomized IDs can in fact exacerbate the extension detection problem, enabling attackers to use a randomized ID as a reliable fingerprint of a user. We study a class of extension revelation attacks, where extensions reveal themselves by injecting their code on web pages. We demonstrate how a combination of revelation and probing can uniquely identify 90% out of all extensions injecting content, in spite of a randomization scheme. We perform a series of large-scale studies to estimate possible implications of both classes of attacks. As a countermeasure, we propose a browser-based mechanism that enables control over which extensions are loaded on which web pages and present a proof of concept implementation which blocks both classes of attacks.",

        "abstract": "Increasingly, mobile application-based ride-hailing \nservices have become a very popular means of transportation. \nDue to the handling of business logic, these services also contain \na wealth of privacy-sensitive information such as GPS locations, \ncar plates, driver licenses, and payment data. Unlike many of \nthe mobile applications in which there is only one type of users, \nride-hailing services face two types of users: riders and drivers. \nWhile most of the efforts had focused on the rider\u2019s privacy, \nunfortunately, we notice little has been done to protect drivers. \nTo raise the awareness of the privacy issues with drivers, in \nthis paper we perform the first systematic study of the drivers\u2019 \nsensitive data leakage in ride-hailing services. More specifically, \nwe select 20 popular ride-hailing apps including Uber and Lyft \nand focus on one particular feature, namely the nearby cars \nfeature. Surprisingly, our experimental results show that largescale \ndata harvesting of drivers is possible for all of the ridehailing \nservices we studied. In particular, attackers can determine \nwith high-precision the driver\u2019s privacy-sensitive information \nincluding mostly visited address (e.g., home) and daily driving behaviors. \nMeanwhile, attackers can also infer sensitive information \nabout the business operations and performances of ride-hailing \nservices such as the number of rides, utilization of cars, and \npresence on the territory. In addition to presenting the attacks, \nwe also shed light on the countermeasures the service providers \ncould take to protect the driver\u2019s sensitive information.",

        "title": "NAUTILUS: Fishing for Deep Bugs with Grammars",
        "abstract": "Fuzz testing is a well-known method for efficiently identifying bugs in programs. Unfortunately, when programs that require highly-structured inputs such as interpreters are fuzzed, many fuzzing methods struggle to pass the syntax checks: interpreters often process inputs in multiple stages, first syntactic and then semantic correctness is checked. Only if both checks are passed, the interpreted code gets executed. This prevents fuzzers from executing \u201cdeeper\u201d \u2014 and hence potentially more interesting \u2014 code. Typically, two valid inputs that lead to the execution of different features in the target program require too many mutations for simple mutation-based fuzzers to discover: making small changes like bit flips usually only leads to the execution of error paths in the parsing engine. So-called grammar fuzzers are able to pass the syntax checks by using ContextFree Grammars. Feedback can significantly increase the efficiency of fuzzing engines and is commonly used in state-of-the-art mutational fuzzers which do not use grammars. Yet, current grammar fuzzers do not make use of code coverage, i.e., they do not know whether any input triggers new functionality. In this paper, we propose NAUTILUS, a method to efficiently fuzz programs that require highly-structured inputs by combining the use of grammars with the use of code coverage feedback. This allows us to recombine aspects of interesting inputs, and to increase the probability that any generated input will be syntactically and semantically correct. We implemented a proofof-concept fuzzer that we tested on multiple targets, including ChakraCore (the JavaScript engine of Microsoft Edge), PHP, mruby, and Lua. NAUTILUS identified multiple bugs in all of the targets: Seven in mruby, three in PHP, two in ChakraCore, and one in Lua. Reporting these bugs was awarded with a sum of 2600 USD and 6 CVEs were assigned. Our experiments show that combining context-free grammars and feedback-driven fuzzing significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches like AFL by an order of magnitude and grammar fuzzers by more than a factor of two when measuring code coverage.",

        "title": "On the Challenges of Geographical Avoidance for Tor",
        "abstract": "Traffic-analysis attacks are a persisting threat for Tor users. When censors or law enforcement agencies try to identify users, they conduct traffic-confirmation attacks and monitor encrypted transmissions to extract metadata\u2014in combination with routing attacks, these attacks become sufficiently powerful to de-anonymize users. While traffic-analysis attacks are hard to detect and expensive to counter in practice, geographical avoidance provides an option to reject circuits that might be routed through an untrusted area. Unfortunately, recently proposed solutions introduce severe security issues by imprudent design decisions. In this paper, we approach geographical avoidance starting from a thorough assessment of its challenges. These challenges serve as the foundation for the design of an empirical avoidance concept that considers actual transmission characteristics for justified decisions. Furthermore, we address the problems of untrusted or intransparent ground truth information that hinder a reliable assessment of circuits. Taking these features into account, we conduct an empirical simulation study and compare the performance of our novel avoidance concept with existing approaches. Our results show that we outperform existing systems by 22% fewer rejected circuits, which reduces the collateral damage of overly restrictive avoidance decisions. In a second evaluation step, we extend our initial system concept and implement the prototype TrilateraTor. This prototype is the first to satisfy the requirements of a practical deployment, as it maintains Tor\u2019s original level of security, provides reasonable performance, and overcomes the fundamental security flaws of existing systems.",

        "title": "The Crux of Voice (In)Security: A Brain Study of Speaker Legitimacy Detection",
        "abstract": "A new generation of scams has emerged that uses voice impersonation to obtain sensitive information, eavesdrop over voice calls and extort money from unsuspecting human users. Research demonstrates that users are fallible to voice impersonation attacks that exploit the current advancement in speech synthesis. In this paper, we set out to elicit a deeper understanding of such human-centered \u201cvoice hacking\u201d based on a neuro-scientific methodology (thereby corroborating and expanding the traditional behavioral-only approach in significant ways). Specifically, we investigate the neural underpinnings of voice security through functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a cutting-edge neuroimaging technique, that captures neural signals in both temporal and spatial domains. We design and conduct an fNIRS study to pursue a thorough investigation of users\u2019 mental processing related to speaker legitimacy detection \u2013 whether a voice sample is rendered by a target speaker, a different other human speaker or a synthesizer mimicking the speaker. We analyze the neural activity associated within this task as well as the brain areas that may control such activity. Our key insight is that there may be no statistically significant differences in the way the human brain processes the legitimate speakers vs. synthesized speakers, whereas clear differences are visible when encountering legitimate vs. different other human speakers. This finding may help to explain users\u2019 susceptibility to synthesized attacks, as seen from the behavioral self-reported analysis. That is, the impersonated synthesized voices may seem indistinguishable from the real voices in terms of both behavioral and neural perspectives. In sharp contrast, prior studies showed subconscious neural differences in other real vs. fake artifacts (e.g., paintings and websites), despite users failing to note these differences behaviorally. Overall, our work dissects the fundamental neural patterns underlying voice-based insecurity and reveals users\u2019 susceptibility to voice synthesis attacks at a biological level. We believe that this could be a significant insight for the security community suggesting that the human detection of voice synthesis attacks may not improve over time, especially given that voice synthesis techniques will likely continue to improve, calling for the design of careful machine-assisted techniques to help humans counter these attacks. *Work done while being a student at UAB",

        "abstract": "Industrial Control Systems (ICS) consisting of integrated hardware and software components designed to monitor and control a variety of industrial processes, are typically deployed in critical infrastructures such as water treatment plants, power grids and gas pipelines. Unlike conventional IT systems, the consequences of deviations from normal operation in ICS have the potential to cause significant physical damage to equipment, the environment and even human life. The active monitoring of invariant rules that define the physical conditions that must be maintained for the normal operation of ICS provides a means to improve the security and dependability of such systems by which early detection of anomalous system states may be achieved, allowing for timely mitigating actions \u2013 such as fault checking, system shutdown \u2013 to be taken. Generally, invariant rules are predefined by system engineers during the design phase of a given ICS build. However, this manually intensive process is costly, error-prone and, in typically complex systems, sub-optimal. In this paper we propose a novel framework that is designed to systematically generate invariant rules from information contained within ICS operational data logs, using a combination of several machine learning and data mining techniques. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by experiments on two real world ICS testbeds: a water distribution system and a water treatment plant. We show that sets of invariant rules, far larger than those defined manually, can be successfully derived by our framework and that they may be used to deliver significant improvements in anomaly detection compared with the invariant rules defined by system engineers as well as the commonly used residual errorbased anomaly detection model for ICS.

        "abstract": "Online guessing attacks against password servers can be hard to address. Approaches that throttle or block repeated guesses on an account (e.g., three strikes type lockout rules) can be effective against depth-first attacks, but are of little help against breadth-first attacks that spread guesses very widely. At large providers with tens, or hundreds, of millions of accounts breadth-first attacks offer a way to send millions or even billions of guesses without ever triggering the depth-first defenses. The absence of labels and non-stationarity of attack traffic make it challenging to apply machine learning techniques. We show how to accurately estimate the odds that an observation x indicates that a request is malicious. Our main assumptions are that successful malicious logins are a small fraction of the total, and that the distribution of x in the legitimate traffic is stationary, or very-slowly varying. From these we show how we can estimate the ratio of bad-to-good traffic among any set of requests; how we can then identify subsets of the request data that contain least (or even no) attack traffic; how these leastattacked subsets allow us to estimate the distribution of values of x over the legitimate data, and hence calculate the odds ratio. A sensitivity analysis shows that even when we fail to identify a subset with little attack traffic our odds ratio estimates are very robust.",

        "title": "NoDoze: Combatting Threat Alert Fatigue with Automated Provenance Triage",
        "abstract": "\u2014Large enterprises are increasingly relying on threat detection softwares (e.g., Intrusion Detection Systems) to allow them to spot suspicious activities. These softwares generate alerts which must be investigated by cyber analysts to \ufb01gure out if they are true attacks. Unfortunately, in practice, there are more alerts than cyber analysts can properly investigate. This leads to a \u201cthreat alert fatigue\u201d or information overload problem where cyber analysts miss true attack alerts in the noise of false alarms. In this paper, we present N O D OZE to combat this challenge using contextual and historical information of generated threat alert. N O D OZE \ufb01rst generates a causal dependency graph of an alert event. Then, it assigns an anomaly score to each edge in the dependency graph based on the frequency with which related events have happened before in the enterprise. N O D OZE then propagates those scores along the neighboring edges of the graph using a novel network diffusion algorithm and generates an aggregate anomaly score which is used for triaging. We deployed and evaluated N O D OZE at NEC Labs America. Evaluation on our dataset of 364 threat alerts shows that N O D OZE consistently ranked the true alerts higher than the false alerts based on aggregate anomaly scores. Further, through the introduction of a cutoff threshold for anomaly scores, we estimate that our system decreases the volume of false alarms by 84%, saving analysts\u2019 more than 90 hours of investigation time per week. N O D OZE generates alert dependency graphs that are two orders of magnitude smaller than those generated by traditional tools without sacri\ufb01cing the vital information needed for the investigation. Our system has a low average runtime overhead and can be deployed with any threat detection software.",

        "abstract": "\u2014GitHub and similar platforms have made public collaborative development of software commonplace. However, a problem arises when this public code must manage authentication secrets, such as API keys or cryptographic secrets. These secrets must be kept private for security, yet common development practices like adding these secrets to code make accidental leakage frequent. In this paper, we present the \ufb01rst large-scale and longitudinal analysis of secret leakage on GitHub. We examine billions of \ufb01les collected using two complementary approaches: a nearly six-month scan of real-time public GitHub commits and a public snapshot covering 13% of open-source repositories. We focus on private key \ufb01les and 11 high-impact platforms with distinctive API key formats. This focus allows us to develop conservative detection techniques that we manually and automatically evaluate to ensure accurate results. We \ufb01nd that not only is secret leakage pervasive \u2014 affecting over 100,000 repositories \u2014 but that thousands of new, unique secrets are leaked every day. We also use our data to explore possible root causes of leakage and to evaluate potential mitigation strategies. This work shows that secret leakage on public repository platforms is rampant and far from a solved problem, placing developers and services at persistent risk of compromise and abuse.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Program obfuscation is a popular cryptographic construct with a wide range of uses such as IP theft prevention. Although cryptographic solutions for program obfuscation impose impractically high overheads, a recent breakthrough leveraging trusted hardware has shown promise. However, the existing solution is based on special-purpose trusted hardware, restricting its use-cases to a limited few. In this paper, we first study if such obfuscation is feasible based on commodity trusted hardware, Intel SGX, and we observe that certain important security considerations are not afforded by commodity hardware. In particular, we found that existing obfuscation/obliviousness schemes are insecure if directly applied to Intel SGX primarily due to side-channel limitations. To this end, we present O BFUSCURO , the first system providing program obfuscation using commodity trusted hardware, Intel SGX. The key idea is to leverage ORAM operations to perform secure code execution and data access. Initially, O BFUSCURO transforms the regular program layout into a side-channel-secure and ORAM-compatible layout. Then, O BFUSCURO ensures that its ORAM controller performs data oblivious accesses in order to protect itself from all memory-based side-channels. Furthermore, O BFUSCURO ensures that the program is secure from timing attacks by ensuring that the program always runs for a pre-configured time interval. Along the way, O BFUSCURO also introduces a systematic optimization such as register-based ORAM stash. We provide a thorough security analysis of O BFUSCURO along with empirical attack evaluations showing that O BFUSCURO can protect the SGX program execution from being leaked by access pattern-based and timing-based",

First, constructing adversarial samples effectively confounds an adversary with a predetermined classi\ufb01er but is less effective when the adversary can adapt to the defense by using alternative classi\ufb01ers or training the classi\ufb01er with adversarial samples. Second, differential-privacy guarantees are very effective against such statistical-inference-based traf\ufb01c analysis, while remaining agnostic to the machine learning clas-si\ufb01ers used by the adversary. We propose two mechanisms for enforcing differential privacy for encrypted streaming traf\ufb01c, and evaluate their security and utility. Our empirical implementation and evaluation suggest that the proposed statistical privacy approaches are promising solutions in the underlying scenarios.",

        "abstract": "We present a black-box, dynamic technique to detect and quantify side-channel information leaks in networked applications that communicate through a TLS-encrypted stream. Given a user-supplied profiling-input suite in which some aspect of the inputs is marked as secret, we run the application over the inputs and capture a collection of variable-length network packet traces. The captured traces give rise to a vast side-channel feature space, including the size and timestamp of each individual packet as well as their aggregations (such as total time, median size, etc.) over every possible subset of packets. Finding the features that leak the most information is a difficult problem. Our approach addresses this problem in three steps: 1) Global analysis of traces for their alignment and identification of phases across traces; 2) Feature extraction using the identified phases; 3) Information leakage quantification and ranking of features via estimation of probability distribution. We embody this approach in a tool called Profit and experimentally evaluate it on a benchmark of applications from the DARPA STAC program, which were developed to assess the effectiveness of side-channel analysis techniques. Our experimental results demonstrate that, given suitable profiling-input suites, Profit is successful in automatically detecting information-leaking features in applications, and correctly ordering the strength of the leakage for differently-leaking variants of the same application.",

        "title": "REDQUEEN: Fuzzing with Input-to-State Correspondence",
        "abstract": "\u2014Automated software testing based on fuzzing has experienced a revival in recent years. Especially feedback-driven fuzzing has become well-known for its ability to ef\ufb01ciently perform randomized testing with limited input corpora. Despite a lot of progress, two common problems are magic numbers and (nested) checksums. Computationally expensive methods such as taint tracking and symbolic execution are typically used to overcome such roadblocks. Unfortunately, such methods often require access to source code, a rather precise description of the environment (e.g., behavior of library calls or the underlying OS), or the exact semantics of the platform\u2019s instruction set. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight, yet very effective alternative to taint tracking and symbolic execution to facilitate and optimize state-of-the-art feedback fuzzing that easily scales to large binary applications and unknown environments. We observe that during the execution of a given program, parts of the input often end up directly (i.e., nearly unmodi\ufb01ed) in the program state. This input-to-state correspondence can be exploited to create a robust method to overcome common fuzzing roadblocks in a highly effective and ef\ufb01cient manner. Our prototype implementation, called R EDQUEEN , is able to solve magic bytes and (nested) checksum tests automatically for a given binary executable. Additionally, we show that our techniques outperform various state-of-the-art tools on a wide variety of targets across different privilege levels (kernel-space and userland) with no platform-speci\ufb01c code. R EDQUEEN is the \ufb01rst method to \ufb01nd more than 100% of the bugs planted in L AVA -M across all targets. Furthermore, we were able to discover 65 new bugs and obtained 16 CVEs in multiple programs and OS kernel drivers. Finally, our evaluation demonstrates that R EDQUEEN is fast, widely applicable and outperforms concurrent approaches by up to three orders of magnitude.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Blockchain technologies recently received a considerable amount of attention. While the initial focus was mainly on the use of blockchains in the context of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, application scenarios now go far beyond this. Most blockchains have the property that once some object, e.g., a block or a transaction, has been registered to be included into the blockchain, it is persisted and there are no means to modify it again. While this is an essential feature of most blockchain scenarios, it is still often desirable\u2014at times it may be even legally required\u2014to allow for breaking this immutability in a controlled way . Only recently, Ateniese et al. (E URO S&P 2017) proposed an elegant solution to this problem on the block level . Thereby, the authors replace standard hash functions with so-called chameleon-hashes (Krawczyk and Rabin, NDSS 2000). While their work seems to offer a suitable solution to the problem of controlled re-writing of blockchains, their approach is too coarse-grained in that it only offers an all-or-nothing solution. We revisit this idea and introduce the novel concept of policy-based chameleon-hashes ( PCH ). PCH s generalize the notion of chameleon-hashes by giving the party computing a hash the ability to associate access policies to the generated hashes. Anyone who possesses enough privileges to satisfy the policy can then \ufb01nd arbitrary collisions for a given hash. We then apply this concept to transaction-level rewriting within blockchains, and thus support \ufb01ne-grained and controlled modi\ufb01ability of blockchain objects. Besides modeling PCH s, we present a generic construction of PCH s (using a strengthened version of chameleon-hashes",

        "abstract": "\u2014The cellular paging (broadcast) protocol strives to balance between a cellular device\u2019s energy consumption and quality-of-service by allowing the device to only periodically poll for pending services in its idle, low-power state. For a given cellular device and serving network, the exact time periods when the device polls for services (called the paging occasion ) are \ufb01xed by design in the 4G/5G cellular protocol. In this paper, we show that the \ufb01xed nature of paging occasions can be exploited by an adversary in the vicinity of a victim to associate the victim\u2019s soft- identity (e.g., phone number, Twitter handle) with its paging occasion, with only a modest cost, through an attack dubbed ToRPEDO . Consequently, ToRPEDO can enable an adversary to verify a victim\u2019s coarse-grained location information, inject fabricated paging messages, and mount denial-of-service attacks. We also demonstrate that, in 4G and 5G, it is plausible for an adversary to retrieve a victim device\u2019s persistent identity (i.e., IMSI) with a brute-force IMSI-Cracking attack while using ToRPEDO as an attack sub-step. Our further investigation on 4G paging protocol deployments also identi\ufb01ed an implementation oversight of several network providers which enables the adversary to launch an attack, named PIERCER , for associating a victim\u2019s phone number with its IMSI; subsequently allowing targeted user location tracking. All of our attacks have been validated and evaluated in the wild using commodity hardware and software. We \ufb01nally discuss potential countermeasures against the presented attacks.",

        "title": "The use of TLS in Censorship Circumvention",
        "abstract": "\u2014TLS, the Transport Layer Security protocol, has quickly become the most popular protocol on the Internet, already used to load over 70% of web pages in Mozilla Firefox. Due to its ubiquity, TLS is also a popular protocol for censorship circumvention tools, including Tor and Signal, among others. However, the wide range of features supported in TLS makes it possible to distinguish implementations from one another by what set of cipher suites, elliptic curves, signature algorithms, and other extensions they support. Already, censors have used deep packet inspection (DPI) to identify and block popular circumvention tools based on the \ufb01ngerprint of their TLS implementation. In response, many circumvention tools have attempted to mimic popular TLS implementations such as browsers, but this technique has several challenges. First, it is burdensome to keep up with the rapidly-changing browser TLS implementations, and know what \ufb01ngerprints would be good candidates to mimic. Second, TLS implementations can be dif\ufb01cult to mimic correctly, as they offer many features that may not be supported by the relatively lightweight libraries used in typical circumvention tools. Finally, dependency changes and updates to the underlying libraries can silently impact what an application\u2019s TLS \ufb01ngerprint looks like, making it dif\ufb01cult for tool maintainers to keep up. In this paper, we collect and analyze real-world TLS traf\ufb01c from over 11.8 billion TLS connections over 9 months to identify a wide range of TLS client implementations actually used on the Internet. We use our data to analyze TLS implementations of several popular censorship circumvention tools, including Lantern, Psiphon, Signal, Outline, TapDance, and Tor (Snow\ufb02ake and meek pluggable transports). We \ufb01nd that the many of these tools use TLS con\ufb01gurations that are easily distinguishable from the real-world traf\ufb01c they attempt to mimic, even when these tools have put effort into parroting popular TLS implementations.",

        "title": "rORAM: Efficient Range ORAM with O(log2 N) Locality",
        "abstract": "Oblivious RAM protocols (ORAMs) allow a client to access data from an untrusted storage device without revealing to that device any information about their access pattern. Typically this is accomplished through random shuffling of the data such that the storage device cannot determine where individual blocks are located, resulting in a highly randomized access pattern. Storage devices however, are typically optimized for sequential access. A large number of random disk seeks during standard ORAM operation induce a substantial overhead. In this paper, we introduce rORAM, an ORAM specifically suited for accessing ranges of sequentially logical blocks while minimizing the number of random physical disk seeks. rORAM obtains significantly better asymptotic efficiency than prior designs (Asharov et al., ePrint 2017, Demertzis et al., CRYPTO 2018) reducing both the number of seeks and communication complexity by a multiplicative factor of O(logN). An rORAM prototype is 30-50x times faster than Path ORAM for similar range-query workloads on local HDDs, 30x faster for local SSDs, and 10x faster for network block devices. rORAM\u2019s novel disk layout can also speed up standard ORAM constructions, e.g., resulting in a 2x faster Path ORAM variant. Importantly, experiments demonstrate suitability for real world applications \u2013 rORAM is up to 5x faster running a file server and up to 11x faster running a range-query intensive video server workloads compared to standard Path ORAM.",
