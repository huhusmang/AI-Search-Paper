        "title": "Bobtail: Improved Blockchain Security with Low-Variance Mining",
        "abstract": "Blockchain systems are designed to produce blocks at a constant average rate. The most popular systems currently employ a Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm as a means of creating these blocks. An unfortunate limitation of all deployed PoW blockchain systems is that the time between blocks has high variance. For example, Bitcoin produces, on average, one block every 10 minutes. However, 5% of the time, Bitcoin\u2019s inter-block time is at least 40 minutes. In this paper, we show that high variance is at the root of several fundamental attacks on PoW blockchains. We propose an alternative process for PoW-based block discovery that results in an inter-block time with significantly lower variance. Our algorithm, called Bobtail , generalizes the current algorithm by comparing the mean of the k -lowest order statistics to a target. We show that the variance of inter-block times decreases as k increases. Bobtail significantly thwarts doublespend and selfish mining attacks, and makes detection of eclipse attacks trivial and quick. For example, for Bitcoin and Ethereum, a doublespending attacker with 40% of the mining power will succeed with 53% probability when the merchant sets up an embargo of 1 block; however, when k \u2265 40 , the probability of success for the same attacker falls to less than 1%. Similarly, for Bitcoin and Ethereum currently, a selfish miner with 49% of the mining power will claim about 95% of blocks; however, when k \u2265 20 , the same miner will find that selfish mining is less successful than honest mining. We also investigate attacks newly made possible by Bobtail and show how they can be defeated. The primary costs of our approach are larger blocks and increased network traffic.",

        "abstract": "\u2014An open research problem on malware analysis is how to statically distinguish between packed and non-packed executables. This has an impact on antivirus software and malware analysis systems, which may need to apply different heuristics or to resort to more costly code emulation solutions to deal with the presence of potential packing routines. It can also affect the results of many research studies in which the authors adopt algorithms that are speci\ufb01cally designed for packed or non-packed binaries. Therefore, a wrong answer to the question \u201cis this executable packed?\u201d can make the difference between malware evasion and detection. It has long been known that packing and entropy are strongly correlated, often leading to the wrong assumption that a low entropy score implies that an executable is NOT packed. Exceptions to this rule exist, but they have always been considered as one-off cases, with a negligible impact on any large scale experiment. However, if such an assumption might have been acceptable in the past, our experiments show that this is not the case anymore as an increasing and remarkable number of packed malware samples implement proper schemes to keep their entropy low. In this paper, we empirically investigate and measure this problem by analyzing a dataset of 50K low-entropy Windows malware samples. Our tests show that, despite all samples have a low entropy value, over 30% of them adopt some form of runtime packing. We then extended our analysis beyond the pure entropy, by considering all static features that have been proposed so far to identify packed code. Again, our tests show that even a state of the art machine learning classi\ufb01er is unable to conclude whether a",

        "abstract": "\u2014Current revocation strategies have numerous issues that prevent their widespread adoption and use, including scalability, privacy, and new infrastructure requirements. Consequently, revocation is often ignored, leaving clients vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. This paper presents Let\u2019s Revoke, a scalable global revocation strategy that addresses the concerns of current revocation checking. Let\u2019s Revoke introduces a new unique identi\ufb01er to each certi\ufb01cate that serves as an index to a dynamically-sized bit vector containing revocation status information. The bit vector approach enables signi\ufb01cantly more ef\ufb01cient revocation checking for both clients and certi\ufb01cate authorities. We compare Let\u2019s Revoke to existing revocation schemes and show that it requires less storage and network bandwidth than other systems, including those that cover only a fraction of the global certi\ufb01cate space. We further demonstrate through simulations that Let\u2019s Revoke scales linearly up to ten billion certi\ufb01cates, even during mass revocation events.",

BLAG uses a sample of the legitimate sources of the customer network\u2019s inbound traf\ufb01c to evaluate the accuracy of each blacklist over regions of address space. It then leverages recommendation systems to select the most accurate information to aggregate into its master blacklist. Finally, BLAG identi\ufb01es portions of the master blacklist that can be expanded into larger address regions (e.g. /24 pre\ufb01xes) to uncover more malicious addresses with minimum collateral damage. Our evaluation of 157 blacklists of various attack types and three ground-truth datasets shows that BLAG achieves high speci\ufb01city up to 99%, improves recall by up to 114 times compared to competing approaches, and detects attacks up to 13.7 days faster, which makes it a promising approach for blacklist generation.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Until now, censorship research has largely focused on highly centralized networks that rely on government-run technical choke-points, such as the Great Firewall of China. Although it was previously thought to be prohibitively dif\ufb01cult, large-scale censorship in decentralized networks are on the rise. Our in-depth investigation of the mechanisms underlying decentralized information control in Russia shows that such large-scale censorship can be achieved in decentralized networks through inexpensive commodity equipment. This new form of information control presents a host of problems for censorship measurement, including dif\ufb01culty identifying censored content, requiring measurements from diverse perspectives, and variegated censorship mechanisms that require signi\ufb01cant effort to identify in a robust manner. By working with activists on the ground in Russia, we obtained \ufb01ve leaked blocklists signed by Roskomnadzor, the Russian government\u2019s federal service for mass communications, along with seven years of historical blocklist data. This authoritative list contains domains, IPs, and subnets that ISPs have been required to block since November 1st, 2012. We used the blocklist from April 24 2019, that contains 132,798 domains, 324,695 IPs, and 39 subnets, to collect active measurement data from residential, data center and infrastructural vantage points. Our vantage points span 408 unique ASes that control \u2248 65% of Russian IP address space. Our \ufb01ndings suggest that data centers block differently from the residential ISPs both in quantity and in method of blocking, resulting in different experiences of the Internet for residential network perspectives and data center perspectives. As expected, residential vantage points experience high levels of censorship. While we observe a range of blocking techniques, such as TCP/IP blocking, DNS manipulation",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of privacy-preserving training and evaluation of neural networks in an $N$-party, federated learning setting. We propose a novel system, POSEIDON, the first of its kind in the regime of privacy-preserving neural network training, employing multiparty lattice-based cryptography and preserving the confidentiality of the training data, the model, and the evaluation data, under a passive-adversary model and collusions between up to $N-1$ parties. To efficiently execute the secure backpropagation algorithm for training neural networks, we provide a generic packing approach that enables Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) operations on encrypted data. We also introduce arbitrary linear transformations within the cryptographic bootstrapping operation, optimizing the costly cryptographic computations over the parties, and we define a constrained optimization problem for choosing the cryptographic parameters. Our experimental results show that POSEIDON achieves accuracy similar to centralized or decentralized non-private approaches and that its computation and communication overhead scales linearly with the number of parties. POSEIDON trains a 3-layer neural network on the MNIST dataset with 784 features and 60K samples distributed among 10 parties in less than 2 hours.",

        "title": "Carnus: Exploring the Privacy Threats of Browser Extension Fingerprinting",
        "abstract": "\u2014With users becoming increasingly privacy-aware and browser vendors incorporating anti-tracking mechanisms, browser \ufb01ngerprinting has garnered signi\ufb01cant attention. Accord-ingly, prior work has proposed techniques for identifying browser extensions and using them as part of a device\u2019s \ufb01ngerprint. While previous studies have demonstrated how extensions can be detected through their web accessible resources, there exists a signi\ufb01cant gap regarding techniques that indirectly detect extensions through behavioral artifacts. In fact, no prior study has demonstrated that this can be done in an automated fashion. In this paper, we bridge this gap by presenting the \ufb01rst fully automated creation and detection of behavior-based extension \ufb01ngerprints. We also introduce two novel \ufb01ngerprinting techniques that monitor extensions\u2019 communication patterns, namely outgoing HTTP requests and intra-browser message exchanges. These techniques comprise the core of Carnus, a modular system for the static and dynamic analysis of extensions, which we use to create the largest set of extension \ufb01ngerprints to date. We leverage our dataset of 29,428 detectable extensions to conduct a comprehensive investigation of extension \ufb01ngerprinting in realistic settings and demonstrate the practicality of our attack. Our in-depth analysis con\ufb01rms the robustness of our techniques, as 83.6% - 87.92% of our behavior-based \ufb01ngerprints remain effective against a state-of-the-art countermeasure. Subsequently, we aim to explore the true extent of the privacy threat that extension \ufb01ngerprinting poses to users, and present a novel study on the feasibility of inference attacks that reveal private and sensitive user information based on the functionality and nature of their extensions. We \ufb01rst collect over 1.44 million public user reviews of our detectable extensions, which provide a unique macroscopic view of the browser extension ecosystem and enable a more precise evaluation of the discriminatory power of extensions as well as a new deanonymization vector. We also automatically categorize extensions based on the developers\u2019 descriptions and identify those that can lead to",

        "title": "Automated Cross-Platform Reverse Engineering of CAN Bus Commands From Mobile Apps",
        "abstract": "In modern automobiles, CAN bus commands are necessary for a wide range of applications such as diagnosis, security monitoring, and recently autonomous driving. However, only a small portion of CAN bus commands is standardized, and a vast majority of them is developed privately by car manufacturers. Today, the most effective way of revealing the proprietary CAN bus commands is to reverse engineer with real cars, which unfortunately is time-consuming and costly. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective (no real car needed) and automatic (no human intervention required) system, CANHUNTER, for reverse engineering of CAN bus commands using just car companion mobile apps. To achieve high effectiveness, we design an efficient technique to uncover the syntactics of CAN bus commands with backward slicing and dynamic forced execution, and a novel algorithm to uncover the semantics of CAN bus commands by leveraging code-level semantic clues. We have implemented a prototype of CANHUNTER for both Android and iOS platforms, and tested it with all free car companion apps (236 in total) from both Google Play and Apple App Store. Among these apps, CANHUNTER discovered 182, 619 unique CAN bus commands with 86.1% of them revealed with semantics, covering 360 car models from 21 car manufactures. We have also evaluated their correctness (both syntactics and semantics) using public resources, cross-platform and cross-app validation, and also realcar testing, with which over 70% of all the uncovered commands are validated. We observe no inconsistency in cross-platform and cross-app validation. While there are 3 semantic inconsistency among 241 manually validated CAN bus commands from public resources and real-car testing, we find that these three cases are actually caused by mistakes from app developers.",

        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple participants to train machine learning models collaboratively by keeping their datasets local while only exchanging model updates. Alas, this is not necessarily free from privacy and robustness vulnerabilities, e.g., via membership, property, and backdoor attacks. This paper investigates whether and to what extent one can use differential Privacy (DP) to protect both privacy and robustness in FL. To this end, we present a first-of-its-kind evaluation of Local and Central Differential Privacy (LDP/CDP) techniques in FL, assessing their feasibility and effectiveness. Our experiments show that both DP variants do d fend against backdoor attacks, albeit with varying levels of protection-utility trade-offs, but anyway more effectively than other robustness defenses. DP also mitigates white-box membership inference attacks in FL, and our work is the first to show it empirically. Neither LDP nor CDP, however, defend against property inference. Overall, our work provides a comprehensive, re-usable measurement methodology to quantify the trade-offs between robustness/privacy and utility in differentially private FL.",

        "title": "FLTrust: Byzantine-robust Federated Learning via Trust Bootstrapping",
        "abstract": "Byzantine-robust federated learning aims to enable a service provider to learn an accurate global model when a bounded number of clients are malicious. The key idea of existing Byzantine-robust federated learning methods is that the service provider performs statistical analysis among the clients' local model updates and removes suspicious ones, before aggregating them to update the global model. However, malicious clients can still corrupt the global models in these methods via sending carefully crafted local model updates to the service provider. The fundamental reason is that there is no root of trust in existing federated learning methods. \nIn this work, we bridge the gap via proposing FLTrust, a new federated learning method in which the service provider itself bootstraps trust. In particular, the service provider itself collects a clean small training dataset (called root dataset) for the learning task and the service provider maintains a model (called server model) based on it to bootstrap trust. In each iteration, the service provider first assigns a trust score to each local model update from the clients, where a local model update has a lower trust score if its direction deviates more from the direction of the server model update. Then, the service provider normalizes the magnitudes of the local model updates such that they lie in the same hyper-sphere as the server model update in the vector space. Our normalization limits the impact of malicious local model updates with large magnitudes. Finally, the service provider computes the average of the normalized local model updates weighted by their trust scores as a global model update, which is used to update the global model. Our extensive evaluations on six datasets from different domains show that our FLTrust is secure against both existing attacks and strong adaptive attacks.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Coverage-based fuzzing has been actively studied and widely adopted for \ufb01nding vulnerabilities in real-world software applications. With coverage information, such as statement coverage and transition coverage, as the guidance of input mutation, coverage-based fuzzing can generate inputs that cover more code and thus \ufb01nd more vulnerabilities without prerequisite information such as input format. Current coverage-based fuzzing tools treat covered code equally. All inputs that contribute to new statements or transitions are kept for future mutation no matter what the statements or transitions are and how much they impact security. Although this design is reasonable from the perspective of software testing that aims at full code coverage, it is inef\ufb01cient for vulnerability discovery since that 1) current techniques are still inadequate to reach full coverage within a reasonable amount of time, and that 2) we always want to discover vulnerabilities early so that it can be \ufb01xed promptly. Even worse, due to the non-discriminative code coverage treatment, current fuzzing tools suffer from recent anti-fuzzing techniques and become much less effective in \ufb01nding vulnerabilities from programs enabled with anti-fuzzing schemes. To address the limitation caused by equal coverage, we propose coverage accounting , a novel approach that evaluates coverage by security impacts. Coverage accounting attributes edges by three metrics based on three different levels: function, loop and basic block. Based on the proposed metrics, we",

While randomized mapping is fully investigated for L1 caches, it still remains unresolved about how to secure a much larger last-level cache (LLC). Recent solutions periodically change the mapping strategy to disrupt the crafting of con\ufb02icted addresses, which is a critical attack procedure to exploit cache con\ufb02icts. Remapping, however, increases both miss rate and access latency. We present PhantomCache for securing an LLC with remapping-free randomized mapping. We propose a localized randomization technique to bound randomized mapping of a memory address within only a limited number of cache sets. The small randomization space offers fast set search over an LLC in a memory access. The intrinsic randomness still suf\ufb01ces to obfuscate con\ufb02icts and disrupt ef\ufb01cient exploitation of con-\ufb02icted addresses. We evaluate PhantomCache against an attacker exploring the state-of-the-art attack with linear-complexity. To secure an 8-bank 16 MB 16-way LLC, PhantomCache con\ufb01nes randomization space of an address within 8 sets and brings only 1.20% performance degradation on individual benchmarks, 0.50% performance degradation on mixed workloads, and 0.50% storage overhead per cache line, which are 2x and 9x more ef\ufb01-cient than the state-of-the-art solutions. Moreover, PhantomCache is solely an architectural solution and requires no software change.",

        "title": "EASI: Edge-Based Sender Identification on Resource-Constrained Platforms for Automotive Networks",
        "abstract": "In vehicles, internal Electronic Control Units (ECUs) are increasingly prone to adversarial exploitation over wireless connections due to ongoing digitalization. Controlling an ECU allows an adversary to send messages to the internal vehicle bus and thereby to control various vehicle functions. Access to the Controller Area Network (CAN), the most widely used bus technology, is especially severe as it controls brakes and steering. However, state of the art receivers are not able to identify the sender of a frame. Retrofitting frame authenticity, e.g. through Message Authentication Codes (MACs), is only possible to a limited extent due to reduced bandwidth, low payload and limited computational resources. To address this problem, observation in analog differences of the CAN signal was proposed to determine the actual sender. Some of the prior approaches exhibit good identification and detection rates, however require high sampling rates and a high computing effort. With EASI we significantly reduce the required resources and at the same time show increased identification rates of 99.98% by having no false positives in a prototype structure and two series production vehicles. In comparison to the most lightweight approach so far, we have reduced the memory footprint and the computational requirements by a factor of 168 and 142, respectively. In addition, we show the feasibility of EASI and thus demonstrate for the first time that voltage-based sender identification is realizable using comprehensive signal characteristics on resource-constrained platforms. Due to the lightweight design, we achieved a classification in under 100\u03bcs with a training time of 2.61 seconds. We also showed the ability to adapt the system to incremental signal changes during operation. Since cost effectiveness is of utmost importance in the automotive industry due to high production volumes, the achieved improvements are significant and necessary to realize sender identification.",

        "abstract": "\u2014To subvert recent advances in perimeter and host security, the attacker community has developed and employed various attack vectors to make a malware much stealthier than before to penetrate the target system and prolong its presence. Such advanced malware or \u201cstealthy malware\u201d makes use of various techniques to impersonate or abuse benign applications and legitimate system tools to minimize its footprints in the target system. It is thus dif\ufb01cult for traditional detection tools, such as malware scanners, to detect it, as the malware normally does not expose its malicious payload in a \ufb01le and hides its malicious behaviors among the benign behaviors of the processes. In this paper, we present P ROV D ETECTOR , a provenance-based approach for detecting stealthy malware. Our insight behind the P ROV D ETECTOR approach is that although a stealthy malware attempts to blend into benign processes, its malicious behaviors inevitably interact with the underlying operating system (OS), which will be exposed to and captured by provenance monitoring. Based on this intuition, P ROV D ETECTOR \ufb01rst employs a novel selection algorithm to identify possibly malicious parts in the OS-level provenance data of a process. It then applies a neural embedding and machine learning pipeline to automatically detect any behavior that deviates signi\ufb01cantly from normal behaviors. We evaluate our approach on a large provenance dataset from an enterprise network and demonstrate that it achieves very high detection performance of stealthy malware (an average F1 score of 0.974). Further, we conduct thorough interpretability studies to understand the internals of the learned machine learning models",

        "title": "Snappy: Fast On-chain Payments with Practical Collaterals",
        "abstract": "Permissionless blockchains offer many advantages but also have significant limitations including high latency. This prevents their use in important scenarios such as retail payments, where merchants should approve payments fast. Prior works have attempted to mitigate this problem by moving transactions off the chain. However, such Layer-2 solutions have their own problems: payment channels require a separate deposit towards each merchant and thus significant locked-in funds from customers; payment hubs require very large operator deposits that depend on the number of customers; and side-chains require trusted validators. \nIn this paper, we propose Snappy, a novel solution that enables recipients, like merchants, to safely accept fast payments. In Snappy, all payments are on the chain, while small customer collaterals and moderate merchant collaterals act as payment guarantees. Besides receiving payments, merchants also act as statekeepers who collectively track and approve incoming payments using majority voting. In case of a double-spending attack, the victim merchant can recover lost funds either from the collateral of the malicious customer or a colluding statekeeper (merchant). Snappy overcomes the main problems of previous solutions: a single customer collateral can be used to shop with many merchants; merchant collaterals are independent of the number of customers; and validators do not have to be trusted. Our Ethereum prototype shows that safe, fast (<2 seconds) and cheap payments are possible on existing blockchains.",

        "abstract": "Network isolation is a critical modern Internet service. To date, network operators have created a logical network of distributed systems to provide communication isolation between different parties. However, the current network isolation is limited in scalability and flexibility. It limits the number of virtual networks and it only supports isolation at host (or virtualmachine) granularity. In this paper, we introduce Scalable Virtual Local Area Networking (SVLAN) that scales to a large number of distributed systems and offers improved flexibility in providing secure network isolation. With the notion of destination-driven reachability and packet-carrying forwarding state, SVLAN not only offers communication isolation but isolation can be specified at different granularities, e.g., per-application or per-process. Our proof-of-concept SVLAN implementation demonstrates its feasibility and practicality for real-world applications.",

        "title": "Learning-based Practical Smartphone Eavesdropping with Built-in Accelerometer",
        "abstract": "\u2014Motion sensors on current smartphones have been exploited for audio eavesdropping due to their sensitivity to vibrations. However, this threat is considered low-risk because of two widely acknowledged limitations: First, unlike microphones, motion sensors can only pick up speech signals traveling through a solid medium. Thus, the only feasible setup reported previously is to use a smartphone gyroscope to eavesdrop on a loudspeaker placed on the same table. The second limitation comes from a common sense that these sensors can only pick up a narrow band (85-100Hz) of speech signals due to a sampling ceiling of 200Hz. In this paper, we revisit the threat of motion sensors to speech privacy and propose AccelEve, a new side-channel attack that employs a smartphone\u2019s accelerometer to eavesdrop on the speaker in the same smartphone. Speci\ufb01cally, it utilizes the accelerometer measurements to recognize the speech emitted by the speaker and to reconstruct the corresponding audio signals. In contrast to previous works, our setup allows the speech signals to always produce strong responses in accelerometer measurements through the shared motherboard, which successfully addresses the \ufb01rst limitation and allows this kind of attacks to penetrate into real-life scenarios. Regarding the sampling rate limitation, contrary to the widely-held belief, we observe up to 500Hz sampling rates in recent smartphones, which almost covers the entire fundamental frequency band (85-255Hz) of adult speech. On top of these pivotal observations, we propose a novel deep learning based system that learns to recognize and reconstruct speech information from the spectrogram representation of acceleration signals. This system employs adaptive optimization on deep neural networks with skip connections using robust and generalizable losses to achieve robust recognition and reconstruction performance. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and high accuracy of our attack under various settings.",

        "abstract": "A bug is a vulnerability if it has security impacts when triggered. Determining the security impacts of a bug is important to both defenders and attackers. Maintainers of large software systems are bombarded with numerous bug reports and proposed patches, with missing or unreliable information about their impact. Determining which few bugs are vulnerabilities is difficult, and bugs that a maintainer believes do not have security impact will be de-prioritized or even ignored. On the other hand, a public report of a bug with a security impact is a powerful first step towards exploitation. Adversaries may exploit such bugs to launch devastating attacks if defenders do not fix them promptly. Common practice is for maintainers to assess the security impacts of bugs manually, but the scaling and reliability challenges of manual analysis lead to missed vulnerabilities. We propose an automated approach, SID, to determine the security impacts for a bug given its patch, so that maintainers can effectively prioritize applying the patch to the affected programs. The insight behind SID is that both the effect of a patch (either submitted or applied) and security-rule violations (e.g., out-of-bound access) can be modeled as constraints that can be automatically solved. SID incorporates rule comparison, using under-constrained symbolic execution of a patch to determine the security impacts of an un-applied patch. SID can further automatically classify vulnerabilities based on their security impacts. We have implemented SID and applied it to bug patches of the Linux kernel and matching CVE-assigned vulnerabilities to evaluate its precision and recall. We optimized SID to reduce false positives, and our evaluation shows that, from 54K recent valid commit patches, SID detected 227 security bugs with at least 243 security impacts at a 97% precision rate. Critically, 197 of them were not reported as vulnerabilities before, leading to delayed or ignored patching in derivative programs. Even worse, 21 of them are still unpatched in the latest Android kernel. Once exploited, they can cause critical security impacts on Android devices. The evaluation results confirm that SID\u2019s approach is effective and precise in automatically determining security impacts for a massive stream of bug patches.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Software vendors collect crash reports from end-users to assist in the debugging and testing of their products. However, crash reports may contain users\u2019 private information, like names and passwords, rendering the user hesitant to share the reports with developers. We need a mechanism to protect users\u2019 privacy in crash reports on the client side while keeping sufficient information to support server-side debugging and analysis. In this paper, we propose the D ESENSITIZATION technique, which generates privacy-aware and attack-preserving crash reports from crashed executions. Our tool adopts lightweight methods to identify bug-related and attack-related data from the memory, and removes other data to protect users\u2019 privacy. Since a large portion of the desensitized memory contains null bytes, we store crash reports in spare files to save the network bandwidth and the server-side storage. We prototype D ESENSITIZATION and apply it to a large number of crashes of real-world programs, like browsers and the JavaScript engine. The result shows that our D ESENSITIZATION technique can eliminate 80.9% of non-zero bytes from coredumps, and 49.0% from minidumps. The desensitized crash report can be 50.5% smaller than the original one, which significantly saves resources for report submission and storage. Our D ESENSITIZATION technique is a push-button solution for the privacy-aware crash report.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Tor is an anonymity network that allows clients to browse web pages privately, but loading web pages with Tor is slow. To analyze how the browser loads web pages, we examine their resource trees using our new browser logging and simulation tool, BLAST. We \ufb01nd that the time it takes to load a web page with Tor is almost entirely determined by the number of round trips incurred, not its bandwidth, and Tor Browser incurs unnecessary round trips. Resources sit in the browser queue excessively waiting for the TCP and TLS handshakes, each of which takes a separate round trip. We show that increasing resource loading capacity with larger pipelines and even HTTP/2 do not decrease load time because they do not save round trips. We set out to minimize round trips with a number of protocol and browser improvements, including TCP Fast Open, optimistic data and 0-RTT TLS. We also recommend the use of databases to assist the client with redirection, identifying HTTP/2 servers, and prefetching. All of these features are designed to cut down on the number of round trips incurred in loading web pages. To evaluate these proposed improvements, we create a simulation tool and validate that it is highly accurate in predicting mean page load times. We use the simulator to analyze these features and it predicts that they will decrease the mean page load time by 61% over HTTP/2. Our large improvement to user experience comes at trivial cost to the Tor network.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Smart contracts have become lucrative and profitable targets for attackers because they can hold a great amount of money. Unfortunately, existing of\ufb02ine approaches for discovering the vulnerabilities in smart contracts or checking the correctness of smart contracts cannot conduct online detection of attacking transactions. Besides, existing online approaches only focus on speci\ufb01c attacks and cannot be easily extended to detect other attacks. Moreover, developing a new online detection system for smart contracts from scratch is time-consuming and requires deep understanding of blockchain internals, thus making it dif\ufb01cult to quickly implement and deploy mechanisms to detect new attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel generic online detection framework named SODA for smart contracts on any blockchains that support Ethereum virtual machine (EVM). SODA distinguishes itself from existing online approaches through its capability, ef\ufb01ciency, and compatibility. First, SODA empowers users to easily develop apps for detecting various attacks online (i.e., when attacks happen) by separating information collection and attack detection with layered design. At the higher layer, SODA provides uni\ufb01ed interfaces to develop detection apps against various attacks. At the lower layer, SODA instruments EVM to collect all primitive information necessary to detect various attacks and constructs 11 kinds of structural information for the ease of developing apps. Based on SODA , users can develop new apps in a few",

        "abstract": "The increasing popularity of virtual reality (VR) in a wide spectrum of applications has generated sensitive personal data such as medical records and credit card information. While protecting such data from unauthorized access is critical, directly applying traditional authentication methods (e.g., PIN) through new VR input modalities such as remote controllers and head navigation would cause security issues. The authentication action can be purposefully observed by attackers to infer the authentication input. Unlike any other mobile devices, VR presents immersive experience via a head-mounted display (HMD) that fully covers users\u2019 eye area without public exposure. Leveraging this feature, we explore human visual system (HVS) as a novel biometric authentication tailored for VR platforms. While previous works used eye globe movement (gaze) to authenticate smartphones or PCs, they suffer from a high error rate and low stability since eye gaze is highly dependent on cognitive states. In this paper, we explore the HVS as a whole to consider not just the eye globe movement but also the eyelid, extraocular muscles, cells, and surrounding nerves in the HVS. Exploring HVS biostructure and unique HVS features triggered by immersive VR content can enhance authentication stability. To this end, we present OcuLock, an HVS-based system for reliable and unobservable VR HMD authentication. OcuLock is empowered by an electrooculography (EOG) based HVS sensing framework and a record-comparison driven authentication scheme. Experiments through 70 subjects show that OcuLock is resistant against common types of attacks such as impersonation attack and statistical attack with Equal Error Rates as low as 3.55% and 4.97% respectively. More importantly, OcuLock maintains a stable performance over a 2month period and is preferred by users when compared to other potential approaches.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Customers of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing services routinely download their raw genetic data and give it to third-party companies that support additional features. One type of analysis, called genetic genealogy, uses genetic data and genealogical methods to \ufb01nd new relatives. While genetic genealogy is quite popular, it has raised new privacy concerns. Genetic genealogy services can be leveraged to \ufb01nd the person corresponding to anonymous genetic data and have been used dozens of times by law enforcement to solve crimes. We hypothesized that the open design and broad API offered by some genetic genealogy services raise other signi\ufb01cant security and privacy issues. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the security practices of GEDmatch, the largest third-party genetic genealogy service. Here, we experimentally show how the GEDmatch API is vulnerable to a number of attacks from an adversary that only uploads normally formatted genetic data \ufb01les and runs standard queries. Using a small number of speci\ufb01cally designed \ufb01les and queries, an attacker can extract a large percentage of the genetic markers from other users; 92% of markers can be extracted with 98% accuracy, including hundreds of medically sensitive markers. We also \ufb01nd that an adversary can construct genetic data \ufb01les that falsely appear like relatives to other samples in the database; in certain situations, these false relatives can be used to make the re-identi\ufb01cation of genetic data more dif\ufb01cult. These attacks are possible because of the rich set of features supported by the API, including detailed visualizations, that are meant to enhance usability. We conclude with security recommendations for genetic genealogy services.",

        "abstract": "\u2014System auditing is a central concern when investigating and responding to security incidents. Unfortunately, attackers regularly engage in anti-forensic activities after a break-in, covering their tracks from the system logs in order to frustrate the efforts of investigators. While a variety of tamper-evident logging solutions have appeared throughout the industry and the literature, these techniques do not meet the operational and scalability requirements of system-layer audit frameworks. In this work, we introduce C USTOS , a practical framework for the detection of tampering in system logs. C USTOS consists of a tamper-evident logging layer and a decentralized auditing protocol. The former enables the veri\ufb01cation of log integrity with minimal changes to the underlying logging framework, while the latter enables near real-time detection of log integrity violations within an enterprise-class network. C USTOS is made practical by the observation that we can decouple the costs of cryptographic log commitments from the act of creating and storing log events, without trading off security, leveraging features of off-the-shelf trusted execution environments. Supporting over one million events per second, we show that C USTOS \u2019 tamper-evident logging protocol is three orders of magnitude (1000 \u00d7 ) faster than prior solutions and incurs only between 2% and 7% runtime overhead over insecure logging on intensive workloads. Further, we show that C USTOS \u2019 auditing protocol can detect violations in near real-time even in the presence of a powerful distributed adversary and with minimal (3%) network overhead. Our case study on a real-world APT attack scenario demonstrates that C USTOS forces anti-forensic attackers into a \u201close-lose\u201d situation, where they can either be covert and not tamper with logs (which can be used for forensics), or erase logs but then",

        "abstract": "\u2014Recent advances in causality analysis have en- abled investigators to trace multi-stage attacks using provenance graphs. Based on system-layer audit logs (e.g., syscalls), these approaches omit vital sources of application context (e.g., email addresses, HTTP response codes) that can be found in higher layers of the system. Although such information is often essential to understanding attack behaviors, it is dif\ufb01cult to incorporate this evidence into causal analysis engines because of the semantic gap that exists between system layers. To address that short- coming, we propose the notion of universal provenance , which encodes all forensically relevant causal dependencies regardless of their layer of origin. To transparently realize that vision on commodity systems, we present OmegaLog, a provenance tracker that bridges the semantic gap between system and application logging contexts. OmegaLog analyzes program binaries to identify and model application-layer logging behaviors, enabling accurate reconciliation of application events with system-layer accesses. OmegaLog then intercepts applications\u2019 runtime logging activities and grafts those events onto the system-layer provenance graph, allowing investigators to reason more precisely about the nature of attacks. We demonstrate that our system is widely applicable to existing software projects and can transparently facilitate execution partitioning of provenance graphs without any training or developer intervention. Evaluation on real-world attack scenarios shows that our technique generates concise provenance graphs with rich semantic information relative to the state-of-the-art, with an average runtime overhead of 4%.",

        "abstract": "\u2014BGP is a gaping security hole in today\u2019s Internet, as evidenced by numerous Internet outages and blackouts, repeated traffic hijacking, and surveillance incidents. To protect against prefix hijacking, the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) has been standardized. Yet, despite Herculean efforts, ubiquitous deployment of the RPKI remains distant, due to RPKI\u2019s manual and error-prone certification process. We argue that deploying origin authentication at scale requires substituting the standard requirement of certifying legal ownership of IP address blocks with the goal of certifying de facto ownership. We show that settling for de facto ownership is sufficient for protecting against hazardous prefix hijacking and can be accomplished without requiring any changes to today\u2019s routing infrastructure. We present DISCO, a readily deployable system that automatically certifies de facto ownership and generates the appropriate BGP-path-filtering rules at routers. We evaluate DISCO\u2019s security and deployability via live experiments on the Internet using a prototype implementation of DISCO and through simulations on empirically-derived datasets. To facilitate the reproducibility of our results, we open source our prototype, simulator, and measurement analysis code [30].",

        "abstract": "\u2014A high-quality outsourced storage service is crucial for many existing applications. For example, hospitals and data centers need to guarantee the availability of their systems to perform routine daily activities. Such a system should protect users against downtime and ensure data availability over time. Continuous data availability is a critical property to measure the quality of an outsourced storage service, which implies that outsourced data is continuously available to the server during the entire storage period. We formally study the Proof of Storage-Time (PoSt), the notion initially proposed in the Filecoin whitepaper, which enables a veri\ufb01er to audit the continuous data availability of an outsourced storage service. We provide a formal security model of PoSt and generic constructions that are proven secure under our de\ufb01nition. Moreover, our concrete instantiation can yield a PoSt protocol with an extremely ef\ufb01cient veri\ufb01cation: a single hash computation to verify a proof of size around 200 bits. This makes our scheme applicable even in the decentralized storage marketplace enabled by blockchain.",

        "abstract": "Cloud-based Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is gradually gaining acceptance as a reliable solution to various real-life scenarios. These services typically utilize Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform classification and detection tasks and are accessed through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Unfortunately, it is possible for an adversary to steal models from cloud-based platforms, even with black-box constraints, by repeatedly querying the public prediction API with malicious inputs. In this paper, we introduce an effective and efficient black-box attack methodology that extracts largescale DNN models from cloud-based platforms with near-perfect performance. In comparison to existing attack methods, we significantly reduce the number of queries required to steal the target model by incorporating several novel algorithms, including active learning, transfer learning, and adversarial attacks. During our experimental evaluations, we validate our proposed model for conducting theft attacks on various commercialized MLaaS platforms hosted by Microsoft, Face++, IBM, Google and Clarifai. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can easily reveal/steal large-scale DNN models from these cloud platforms. The proposed attack method can also be used to accurately evaluates the robustness of DNN based MLaaS classifiers against theft attacks.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Virtual machine monitors (VMMs, also called hy-pervisors ) represent a very critical part of a modern software stack: compromising them could allow an attacker to take full control of the whole cloud infrastructure of any cloud provider. Hence their security is critical for many applications, especially in the context of Infrastructure-as-a-Service. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of H YPER -C UBE , a novel fuzzer that aims explicitly at testing hypervisors in an ef\ufb01cient, effective, and precise way. Our approach is based on a custom operating system that implements a custom bytecode interpreter. This high-throughput design for long-running, interactive targets allows us to fuzz a large number of both open source and proprietary hypervisors. In contrast to one-dimensional fuzzers such as AFL, H YPER -C UBE can interact with any number of interfaces in any order. Our evaluation results show that we can \ufb01nd more bugs (over 2 \u00d7 ) and coverage (as much as 2 \u00d7 ) than state-of-the-art hypervisor fuzzers. In most cases, we were even able to do so using multiple orders of magnitude less time than comparable fuzzers. H YPER -C UBE was also able to rediscover a set of well-known hypervisor vulnerabilities, such as VENOM, in less than \ufb01ve minutes. In total, we found 54 novel bugs, and so far obtained 43 CVEs. Our evaluation results demonstrate that next-generation coverage-guided fuzzers should incorporate a higher-throughput design for long-running targets such as hypervisors.",

        "title": "XDA: Accurate, Robust Disassembly with Transfer Learning",
        "abstract": "Accurate and robust disassembly of stripped binaries is challenging. The root of the difficulty is that high-level structures, such as instruction and function boundaries, are absent in stripped binaries and must be recovered based on incomplete information. Current disassembly approaches rely on heuristics or simple pattern matching to approximate the recovery, but these methods are often inaccurate and brittle, especially across different compiler optimizations. \nWe present XDA, a transfer-learning-based disassembly framework that learns different contextual dependencies present in machine code and transfers this knowledge for accurate and robust disassembly. We design a self-supervised learning task motivated by masked Language Modeling to learn interactions among byte sequences in binaries. The outputs from this task are byte embeddings that encode sophisticated contextual dependencies between input binaries' byte tokens, which can then be finetuned for downstream disassembly tasks. \nWe evaluate XDA's performance on two disassembly tasks, recovering function boundaries and assembly instructions, on a collection of 3,121 binaries taken from SPEC CPU2017, SPEC CPU2006, and the BAP corpus. The binaries are compiled by GCC, ICC, and MSVC on x86/x64 Windows and Linux platforms over 4 optimization levels. XDA achieves 99.0% and 99.7% F1 score at recovering function boundaries and instructions, respectively, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art on both tasks. It also maintains speed on par with the fastest ML-based approach and is up to 38x faster than hand-written disassemblers like IDA Pro.",

We present UNICORN, an anomaly-based APT detector that effectively leverages data provenance analysis. From modeling to detection, UNICORN tailors its design specifically for the unique characteristics of APTs. Through extensive yet time-efficient graph analysis, UNICORN explores provenance graphs that provide rich contextual and historical information to identify stealthy anomalous activities without pre-defined attack signatures. Using a graph sketching technique, it summarizes long-running system execution with space efficiency to combat slow-acting attacks that take place over a long time span. UNICORN further improves its detection capability using a novel modeling approach to understand long-term behavior as the system evolves. Our evaluation shows that UNICORN outperforms an existing state-of-the-art APT detection system and detects real-life APT scenarios with high accuracy.",

        "title": "HFL: Hybrid Fuzzing on the Linux Kernel",
        "abstract": "Hybrid fuzzing, combining symbolic execution and fuzzing, is a promising approach for vulnerability discovery because each approach can complement the other. However, we observe that applying hybrid fuzzing to kernel testing is challenging because the following unique characteristics of the kernel make a naive adoption of hybrid fuzzing inefficient: 1) having indirect control transfers determined by system call arguments, 2) controlling and matching internal system state via system calls, and 3) inferring nested argument type for invoking system calls. Failure to handling such challenges will render both fuzzing and symbolic execution inefficient, and thereby, will result in an inefficient hybrid fuzzing. Although these challenges are essential to both fuzzing and symbolic execution, to the best of our knowledge, existing kernel testing approaches either naively use each technique separately without handling such challenges or imprecisely handle a part of challenges only by static analysis. To this end, this paper proposes HFL, which not only combines fuzzing with symbolic execution for hybrid fuzzing but also addresses kernel-specific fuzzing challenges via three distinct features: 1) converting indirect control transfers to direct transfers, 2) inferring system call sequence to build a consistent system state, and 3) identifying nested arguments types of system calls. As a result, HFL found 24 previously unknown vulnerabilities in recent Linux kernels. Additionally, HFL achieves 15% and 26% higher code coverage than Moonshine and Syzkaller, respectively, and over kAFL/S2E/TriforceAFL, achieving even four times better coverage, using the same amount of resources (CPU, time, etc.). Regarding vulnerability discovery performance, HFL found 13 known vulnerabilities more than three times faster than Syzkaller.",

        "abstract": "Embedded systems are deployed in security critical environments and have become a prominent target for remote attacks. Microcontroller-based systems (MCUS) are particularly vulnerable due to a combination of limited resources and low level programming which leads to bugs. Since MCUS are often a part of larger systems, vulnerabilities may jeopardize not just the security of the device itself but that of other systems as well. For example, exploiting a WiFi System on Chip (SoC) allows an attacker to hijack the smart phone\u2019s application processor. Control-flow hijacking targeting the backward edge (e.g., Return-Oriented Programming\u2013ROP) remains a threat for MCUS. Current defenses are either susceptible to ROP-style attacks or require special hardware such as a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) that is not commonly available on MCUS. We present \u03bcRAI , a compiler-based mitigation to prevent control-flow hijacking attacks targeting backward edges by enforcing the Return Address Integrity (RAI) property on MCUS. \u03bcRAI does not require any additional hardware such as TEE, making it applicable to the wide majority of MCUS. To achieve this, \u03bcRAI introduces a technique that moves return addresses from writable memory, to readable and executable memory. It repurposes a single general purpose register that is never spilled, and uses it to resolve the correct return location. We evaluate against the different control-flow hijacking attacks scenarios targeting return addresses (e.g., arbitrary write), and demonstrate how \u03bcRAI prevents them all. Moreover, our evaluation shows that \u03bcRAI enforces its protection with negligible overhead.",

        "abstract": "Robocalls are inundating phone users. These automated calls allow for attackers to reach massive audiences with scams ranging from credential hijacking to unnecessary IT support in a largely untraceable fashion. In response, many applications have been developed to alert mobile phone users of incoming robocalls. However, how well these applications communicate risk with their users is not well understood. In this paper, we identify common real-time security indicators used in the most popular anti-robocall applications. Using focus groups and user testing, we first identify which of these indicators most effectively alert users of danger. We then demonstrate that the most powerful indicators can reduce the likelihood that users will answer such calls by as much as 43%. Unfortunately, our evaluation also shows that attackers can eliminate the gains provided by such indicators using a small amount of targetspecific information (e.g., a known phone number). In so doing, we demonstrate that anti-robocall indicators could benefit from significantly increased attention from the research community.",

        "abstract": "The Content Security Policy (CSP) mechanism was developed as a mitigation against script injection attacks in 2010. In this paper, we leverage the unique vantage point of the Internet Archive to conduct a historical and longitudinal analysis of how CSP deployment has evolved for a set of 10,000 highly ranked domains. In doing so, we document the long-term struggle site operators face when trying to roll out CSP for content restriction and highlight that even seemingly secure whitelists can be bypassed through expired or typo domains. Next to these new insights, we also shed light on the usage of CSP for other use cases, in particular, TLS enforcement and framing control. Here, we find that CSP can be easily deployed to fit those security scenarios, but both lack wide-spread adoption. Specifically, while the underspecified and thus inconsistently implemented X-Frame-Options header is increasingly used on the Web, CSP\u2019s well-specified and secure alternative cannot keep up. To understand the reasons behind this, we run a notification campaign and subsequent survey, concluding that operators have often experienced the complexity of CSP (and given up), utterly unaware of the easy-to-deploy components of CSP. Hence, we find the complexity of secure, yet functional content restriction gives CSP a bad reputation, resulting in operators not leveraging its potential to secure a site against the non-original attack vectors.",

        "abstract": "\u2014In distributed private learning, e.g., data analysis, machine learning, and enterprise benchmarking, it is common-place for two parties with con\ufb01dential data sets to compute statistics over their combined data. The median is an important robust statistical method used in enterprise benchmarking, e.g., companies compare typical employee salaries, insurance companies use median life expectancy to adjust insurance premiums, banks compare credit scores of their customers, and \ufb01nancial regulators estimate risks based on loan exposures. The exact median can be computed securely, however, it leaks information about the private data. To protect the data sets, we securely compute a differentially private median over the joint data set via the exponential mechanism. The exponential mechanism has a runtime linear in the data universe size and ef\ufb01ciently sampling it is non-trivial. Local differential privacy, where each user shares locally perturbed data with an untrusted server, is often used in private learning but does not provide the same utility as the central model, where noise is only applied once by a trusted server. We present an ef\ufb01cient secure computation of a differentially private median of the union of two large, con\ufb01dential data sets. Our protocol has a runtime sublinear in the size of the data universe and utility like the central model without a trusted third party. We provide differential privacy for small data sets (sublinear in the size of the data universe) and prune large data sets with a relaxed notion of differential privacy providing limited group privacy. We use dynamic programming with a static, i.e., data-independent, access pattern, achieving low complexity of the secure computation circuit. We provide a comprehensive evaluation over multiple AWS regions (from Ohio to N. Virgina, Canada and Frankfurt) with a large real-world data set with a practical runtime of less than 7 seconds for millions of records.",

        "abstract": "Existing censorship circumvention systems fail to offer reliable circumvention without sacrificing their users\u2019 QoS and privacy, or undertaking high costs of operation. We have designed and implemented a censorship circumvention system, MassBrowser, whose goal is to offer effective censorship circumvention to a large mass of censored users, with a high quality of service (QoS), low cost of operation, and adjustable privacy protection. Towards this, we have made several key decisions in designing our system. First, we argue that circumvention systems should not bundle strong privacy protections (like anonymity) with censorship circumvention. Additional privacy properties should be offered to the users of circumvention systems as optional features which can be enabled by specific users or on specific connections (perhaps by trading off some QoS). Second, we have engineered MassBrowser by combining various state-of-the-art circumvention techniques to ensure strong censorship resilience at a very low cost of operation (i.e., $0.0001 per censored client per month when deployed at a large scale). In particular, MassBrowser aims at increasing the collateral damage of censorship by employing a \u201cmass\u201d of normal Internet users, from both censored and non-censored areas, to serve as circumvention proxies. Also, MassBrowser uses various techniques, like CDNBrowsing, to optimize the loads on circumvention proxies. We have built and deployed MassBrowser as a fully operational system with end-user GUI software for major operating systems. Our system has been in the beta release mode for over a year with hundreds of invited users from major censored countries testing it on a daily basis.",

        "abstract": "Contemporary fuzz testing techniques focus on identifying memory corruption vulnerabilities that allow adversaries to achieve either remote code execution or information disclosure. Meanwhile, Algorithmic Complexity (AC)vulnerabilities, which are a common attack vector for denial-of-service attacks, remain an understudied threat. In this paper, we present HotFuzz, a framework for automatically discovering AC vulnerabilities in Java libraries. HotFuzz uses micro-fuzzing, a genetic algorithm that evolves arbitrary Java objects in order to trigger the worst-case performance for a method under test. We define Small Recursive Instantiation (SRI) as a technique to derive seed inputs represented as Java objects to micro-fuzzing. After micro-fuzzing, HotFuzz synthesizes test cases that triggered AC vulnerabilities into Java programs and monitors their execution in order to reproduce vulnerabilities outside the fuzzing framework. HotFuzz outputs those programs that exhibit high CPU utilization as witnesses for AC vulnerabilities in a Java library. We evaluate HotFuzz over the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the 100 most popular Java libraries on Maven, and challenges contained in the DARPA Space and Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) program. We evaluate SRI's effectiveness by comparing the performance of micro-fuzzing with SRI, measured by the number of AC vulnerabilities detected, to simply using empty values as seed inputs. In this evaluation, we verified known AC vulnerabilities, discovered previously unknown AC vulnerabilities that we responsibly reported to vendors, and received confirmation from both IBM and Oracle. Our results demonstrate that micro-fuzzing finds AC vulnerabilities in real-world software, and that micro-fuzzing with SRI-derived seed inputs outperforms using empty values.",

        "abstract": "\u2014With recent advances in arti\ufb01cial intelligence and natural language processing, voice has become a primary method for human-computer interaction. It has enabled game-changing new technologies in both commercial sectors and military sectors, such as Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, and voice-controlled naval warships. Recently, researchers have demonstrated that these voice assistant systems are susceptible to signal injection at the inaudible frequencies. To date, most of the existing works focus primarily on delivering a single command via line-of-sight ultrasound speaker or extending the range of this attack via speaker array. However, besides air, sound waves also propagate through other materials where vibration is possible. In this work, we aim to understand the characteristics of this new genre of attack in the context of different transmission media. Furthermore, by leveraging the unique properties of acoustic transmission in solid materials, we design a new attack called Sur\ufb01ngAttack that would enable multiple rounds of interactions between the voice-controlled device and the attacker over a longer distance and without the need to be in line-of-sight. By completing the interaction loop of inaudible sound attack, Sur\ufb01ngAttack enables new attack scenarios, such as hijacking a mobile Short Message Service (SMS) passcode, making ghost fraud calls without owners\u2019 knowledge, etc. To accomplish Sur\ufb01ngAttack , we have solved several major challenges. First, the signal has been specially designed to allow omni-directional transmission for performing effective attacks over a solid medium. Second, the new attack enables multi-round interaction without alerting the legitimate user at the scene, which is challenging since the device is designed to interact with users in physical proximity rather than sensors. To mitigate this newly discovered threat,",

        "abstract": "\u2014Existing attack investigation solutions for GUI applications suffer from a few limitations such as inaccuracy (because of the dependence explosion problem), requiring instrumentation, and providing very low visibility. Such limitations have hindered their widespread and practical deployment. In this paper, we present UIS COPE , a novel accurate, instrumentation-free, and visible attack investigation system for GUI applications. The core idea of UIS COPE is to perform causality analysis on both UI elements/events which represent users\u2019 perspective and low-level system events which provide detailed information of what happens under the hood, and then correlate system events with UI events to provide high accuracy and visibility. Long running processes are partitioned to individual UI transitions, to which low-level system events are attributed, making the results accurate. The produced graphs contain (causally related) UI elements with which users are very familiar, making them easily accessible. We deployed UIS COPE on 7 machines for a week, and also utilized UIS COPE to conduct an investigation of 6 real-world attacks. Our evaluation shows that compared to existing works, UIS COPE introduces neglibible overhead (less than 1% runtime overhead and 3.05 MB event logs per hour on average) while UIS COPE can precisely identify attack provenance while offering users thorough visibility into the attack context.",

        "title": "NoJITsu: Locking Down JavaScript Engines",
        "abstract": "\u2014Data-only attacks against dynamic scripting environments have become common. Web browsers and other modern applications embed scripting engines to support interactive content. The scripting engines optimize performance via just-in-time compilation. Since applications are increasingly hardened against code-reuse attacks, adversaries are looking to achieve code execution or elevate privileges by corrupting sensitive data like the intermediate representation of optimizing JIT compilers. This has inspired numerous defenses for just-in-time compilers. Our paper demonstrates that securing JIT compilation is not suf\ufb01cient. First, we present a proof-of-concept data-only attack against a recent version of Mozilla\u2019s SpiderMonkey JIT in which the attacker only corrupts heap objects to successfully issue a system call from within bytecode execution at run time. Previous work assumed that bytecode execution is safe by construction since interpreters only allow a narrow set of benign instructions and bytecode is always checked for validity before execution. We show that this does not prevent malicious code execution in practice. Second, we design a novel defense, dubbed N O JIT SU to protect complex, real-world scripting engines from data-only attacks against interpreted code. The key idea behind our defense is to enable \ufb01ne-grained memory access control for individual memory regions based on their roles throughout the JavaScript lifecycle. For this we combine automated analysis, instrumentation, compartmentalization, and Intel\u2019s Memory-Protection Keys to secure SpiderMonkey against existing and newly synthesized attacks. We implement and thoroughly test our implementation using a number of real-world scenarios as well as standard benchmarks. We show that N O JIT SU successfully thwarts code-reuse as well as data-only attacks against any part of the scripting engine while offering a modest run-time overhead of only 5%.",

        "abstract": "Out-of-order execution and speculative execution are among the biggest contributors to performance and efficiency of modern processors. However, they are inconsiderate, leaking secret data during the transient execution of instructions. Many solutions and hardware fixes have been proposed for mitigating transient-execution attacks. However, they either do not eliminate the leakage entirely or introduce unacceptable performance penalties. In this paper, we propose ConTExT, a Considerate Transient Execution Technique. ConTExT is a minimal and fully backward compatible architecture change. The basic idea of ConTExT is that secrets can enter registers but not transiently leave them. ConTExT transforms Spectre from a problem that cannot be solved purely in software [65], to a problem that is not easy to solve, but solvable in software. For this, ConTExT requires minimal, fully backward-compatible modifications of applications, compilers, operating systems, and the hardware. ConTExT offers full protection for secrets in memory and secrets in registers. With ConTExT-light, we propose a software-only solution of ConTExT for existing commodity CPUs protecting secrets in memory. We evaluate the security and performance of ConTExT. Even when over-approximating with ConTExT-light, we observe no performance overhead for unprotected code and data, and an overhead between 0% and 338% for security-critical applications while protecting against all Spectre variants.",

        "title": "SymTCP: Eluding Stateful Deep Packet Inspection with Automated Discrepancy Discovery",
        "abstract": "A key characteristic of commonly deployed deep packet inspection (DPI) systems is that they implement a simplified state machine of the network stack that often differs from that of endhosts. The discrepancies between the two state machines have been exploited to bypass such DPI based middleboxes. However, most prior approaches to do so rely on manually crafted adversarial packets, which not only are labor-intensive but may not work well across a plurality of DPI-based middleboxes. Our goal in this work is to develop an automated way to craft candidate adversarial packets, targeting TCP implementations in particular. Our approach to achieving this goal hinges on the key insight that while the TCP state machines of DPI implementations are obscure, those of the endhosts are well established. Thus, in our system SYMTCP, using symbolic execution, we systematically explore the TCP implementation of an endhost, identifying candidate packets that can reach critical points in the code (e.g., which causes the packets to be accepted or dropped/ignored); such automatically identified packets are then fed through the DPI middlebox to determine if a discrepancy is induced and the middlebox can be eluded. We find that our approach is extremely effective. It can generate tens of thousands of candidate adversarial packets in less than an hour. When evaluating against multiple state-of-the-art DPI systems such as Zeek and Snort, as well as a state-level censorship system, viz. the Great Firewall of China, we identify not only previously known evasion strategies, but also novel ones that were never previously reported (e.g., involving the urgent pointer). The system can be extended easily towards other combinations of operating systems and DPI middleboxes, and serves as a valuable tool for testing future DPIs\u2019 robustness against evasion attempts.",

        "title": "Practical Traffic Analysis Attacks on Secure Messaging Applications",
        "abstract": "Instant Messaging (IM) applications like Telegram, Signal, and WhatsApp have become extremely popular in recent years. Unfortunately, such IM services have been targets of continuous governmental surveillance and censorship, as these services are home to public and private communication channels on socially and politically sensitive topics. To protect their clients, popular IM services deploy state-of-the-art encryption mechanisms. In this paper, we show that despite the use of advanced encryption, popular IM applications leak sensitive information about their clients to adversaries who merely monitor their encrypted IM traffic, with no need for leveraging any software vulnerabilities of IM applications. Specifically, we devise traffic analysis attacks that enable an adversary to identify administrators as well as members of target IM channels (e.g., forums) with high accuracies. We believe that our study demonstrates a significant, real-world threat to the users of such services given the increasing attempts by oppressive governments at cracking down controversial IM channels. \nWe demonstrate the practicality of our traffic analysis attacks through extensive experiments on real-world IM communications. We show that standard countermeasure techniques such as adding cover traffic can degrade the effectiveness of the attacks we introduce in this paper. We hope that our study will encourage IM providers to integrate effective traffic obfuscation countermeasures into their software. In the meantime, we have designed and deployed an open-source, publicly available countermeasure system, called IMProxy, that can be used by IM clients with no need for any support from IM providers. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of IMProxy through experiments.",

        "abstract": "Over-sharing poorly-worded thoughts and personal information is prevalent on online social platforms. In many of these cases, users regret posting such content. To retrospectively rectify these errors in users' sharing decisions, most platforms offer (deletion) mechanisms to withdraw the content, and social media users often utilize them. Ironically and perhaps unfortunately, these deletions make users more susceptible to privacy violations by malicious actors who specifically hunt post deletions at large scale. The reason for such hunting is simple: deleting a post acts as a powerful signal that the post might be damaging to its owner. Today, multiple archival services are already scanning social media for these deleted posts. Moreover, as we demonstrate in this work, powerful machine learning models can detect damaging deletions at scale. \nTowards restraining such a global adversary against users' right to be forgotten, we introduce Deceptive Deletion, a decoy mechanism that minimizes the adversarial advantage. Our mechanism injects decoy deletions, hence creating a two-player minmax game between an adversary that seeks to classify damaging content among the deleted posts and a challenger that employs decoy deletions to masquerade real damaging deletions. We formalize the Deceptive Game between the two players, determine conditions under which either the adversary or the challenger provably wins the game, and discuss the scenarios in-between these two extremes. We apply the Deceptive Deletion mechanism to a real-world task on Twitter: hiding damaging tweet deletions. We show that a powerful global adversary can be beaten by a powerful challenger, raising the bar significantly and giving a glimmer of hope in the ability to be really forgotten on social platforms.",

        "abstract": "Social media has become a primary mean of content and information sharing, thanks to its speed and simplicity. In this scenario, link previews play the important role of giving a meaningful first glance to users, summarizing the content of the shared webpage within their title, description and image. In our work, we analyzed the preview-rendering process, observing how it is possible to misuse it to obtain benign-looking previews for malicious links. Concrete use-case of this research field is phishing and spam spread, considering targeted attacks in addition to large-scale campaigns. \n \nWe designed a set of experiments for 20 social media platforms including social networks and instant messenger applications and found out how most of the platforms follow their own preview design and format, sometimes providing partial information. Four of these platforms allow preview crafting so as to hide the malicious target even to a tech-savvy user, and we found that it is possible to create misleading previews for the remaining 16 platforms when an attacker can register their own domain. We also observe how 18 social media platforms do not employ active nor passive countermeasures against the spread of known malicious links or software, and that existing cross-checks on malicious URLs can be bypassed through client and server-side redirections. To conclude, we suggest seven recommendations covering the spectrum of our findings, to improve the overall preview-rendering mechanism and increase users\u2019 overall trust in social media platforms.",

        "title": "A Practical Approach for Taking Down Avalanche Botnets Under Real-World Constraints",
        "abstract": "In 2016, law enforcement dismantled the infrastructure of the Avalanche bulletproof hosting service, the largest takedown of a cybercrime operation so far. The malware families supported by Avalanche use Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to generate random domain names for controlling their botnets. The takedown proactively targets these presumably malicious domains; however, as coincidental collisions with legitimate domains are possible, investigators must first classify domains to prevent undesirable harm to website owners and botnet victims. The constraints of this real-world takedown (proactive decisions without access to malware activity, no bulk patterns and no active connections) mean that approaches from the state of the art cannot be applied. The problem of classifying thousands of registered DGA domain names therefore required an extensive, painstaking manual effort by law enforcement investigators. To significantly reduce this effort without compromising correctness, we develop a model that automates the classification. Through a synergetic approach, we achieve an accuracy of 97.6% with ground truth from the 2017 and 2018 Avalanche takedowns; for the 2019 takedown, this translates into a reduction of 76.9% in manual investigation effort. Furthermore, we interpret the model to provide investigators with insights into how benign and malicious domains differ in behavior, which features and data sources are most important, and how the model can be applied according to the practical requirements of a real-world takedown.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Intermediary web services such as web proxies, web translators, and web archives have become pervasive as a means to enhance the openness of the web. These services aim to remove the intrinsic obstacles to web access; i.e., access blocking, language barriers, and missing web pages. In this study, we refer to these services as web rehosting services and make the \ufb01rst exploration of their security \ufb02aws. The web rehosting services use a single domain name to rehost several websites that have distinct domain names; this characteristic makes web rehosting services intrinsically vulnerable to violating the same origin policy if not operated carefully. Based on the intrinsic vulnerability of web rehosting services, we demonstrate that an attacker can perform \ufb01ve different types of attacks that target users who make use of web rehosting services: persistent man-in-the-middle attack, abusing privileges to access various resources, stealing credentials, stealing browser history, and session hijacking/injection. Our extensive analysis of 21 popular web rehosting services, which have more than 200 million accesses per day, revealed that these attacks are feasible. In response to this observation, we provide effective countermeasures against each type of attack.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Long Term Evolution (LTE/4G) establishes mutual authentication with a provably secure Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol on layer three of the network stack. Permanent integrity protection of the control plane safeguards the traf\ufb01c against manipulations. However, missing integrity protection of the user plane still allows an adversary to manipulate and redirect IP packets, as recently demonstrated. In this work, we introduce a novel cross-layer attack that exploits the existing vulnerability on layer two and extends it with an attack mechanism on layer three. More precisely, we take advantage of the default IP stack behavior of operating systems and show that this combination allows an active attacker to impersonate a user towards the network and vice versa; we name these attacks IMP 4G T (IMPersonation attacks in 4G neTworks). In contrast to a simple redirection attack as demonstrated in prior work, our attack dramatically extends the possible attack scenarios and thus emphasizes the need for user plane integrity protection in mobile communication standards. The results of our work imply that providers can no longer rely on mutual authentication for billing, access control, and legal prosecution. On the other side, users are exposed to any incoming IP connection as an adversary can bypass the provider\u2019s \ufb01rewall. To demonstrate the practical impact of our attack, we conduct two IMP 4G T attack variants in a commercial network, which\u2014 for the \ufb01rst time\u2014completely break the mutual authentication aim of LTE on the user plane in a real-world setting.",

        "title": "ABSynthe: Automatic Blackbox Side-channel Synthesis on Commodity Microarchitectures",
        "abstract": "\u2014The past decade has seen a plethora of side-channel attacks on various CPU components. Each new attack typically follows a whitebox analysis approach, which involves (i) identifying a speci\ufb01c shared CPU component, (ii) reversing its behavior on a speci\ufb01c microarchitecture, and (iii) surgically exploiting such knowledge to leak information (e.g., by actively evicting shared entries to monitor victim accesses). This approach requires lengthy reverse engineering, repeated for every component and microarchitecture, and does not allow for attacking unknown shared resources. In this paper, we present ABSynthe, a system that takes a target program and a microarchitecture as inputs and automatically synthesizes new side channels. The key insight is that by limiting ourselves to (typically on-core) contention-based side channels, we can treat the target CPU microarchitecture as a black box, enabling automation. To make ABSynthe possible, we have automatically generated leakage maps for a variety of x86_64 microarchitectures. These leakage maps show a complex picture of interaction between different x86_64 instructions and justify a black box approach to \ufb01nding the best sequence of instructions that cause information to leak from a given software target, which we also treat as a black box. To recover the secret information using the optimized sequence of instructions, ABSynthe relies on a recurrent neural network to craft practical side-channel attacks that recover a secret bit stream. Our evaluation shows that ABSynthe can synthesize better attacks by exploiting contention on multiple components at the same time compared to state of the art contention-based attacks that focus on a single component. Furthermore, the automation made possible by ABSynthe allows us to synthesize cross-thread attacks for a variety of microarchitectures (from Intel, AMD and ARM) on four different cryptographic software targets, in both native and virtualized environments. The results show that ABSynthe can",

However, if a participant in a video call is not careful, he/she can reveal his/her private information to others in the call. In this paper, we design and evaluate an attack framework to infer one type of such private information from the video stream of a call -- keystrokes, i.e., text typed during the call. We evaluate our video-based keystroke inference framework using different experimental settings and parameters, including different webcams, video resolutions, keyboards, clothing, and backgrounds. Our relatively high keystroke inference accuracies under commonly occurring and realistic settings highlight the need for awareness and countermeasures against such attacks. Consequently, we also propose and evaluate effective mitigation techniques that can automatically protect users when they type during a video call.",

        "abstract": "\u2014E-commerce miscreants heavily rely on instant messaging (IM) to promote their illicit businesses and coordinate their operations. The threat intelligence provided by IM communication, therefore, becomes invaluable for understanding and mitigating the threats of e-commerce frauds. However, such information is hard to obtain since it is usually shared only through one-on-one conversations with the criminals. In this paper, we present the \ufb01rst chatbot, called Aubrey , to actively collect such intelligence through autonomous chats with real-world e-commerce miscreants. Our approach leverages the question-driven conversation pattern of small-time workers, who seek jobs and/or attack resources from e-commerce fraudsters, to model the interaction process as a \ufb01nite state machine, thereby enabling an autonomous conversation. Aubrey successfully chatted with 470 real-world e-commerce miscreants and gathered a large amount of fraud-related artifacts, including previously-unknown SIM gateways, account trading websites, and attack toolkits, etc. Further, the conversations revealed the supply chain of e-commerce fraudulent activities on the deep web and the complicated relations (e.g., complicity and reselling) among miscreants.",

        "title": "Towards Measuring Supply Chain Attacks on Package Managers for Interpreted Languages",
        "abstract": "Package managers have become a vital part of the modern software development process. They allow developers to reuse third-party code, share their own code, minimize their codebase, and simplify the build process. However, recent reports showed that package managers have been abused by attackers to distribute malware, posing significant security risks to developers and end-users. For example, eslint-scope, a package with millions of weekly downloads in Npm, was compromised to steal credentials from developers. To understand the security gaps and the misplaced trust that make recent supply chain attacks possible, we propose a comparative framework to qualitatively assess the functional and security features of package managers for interpreted languages. Based on qualitative assessment, we apply well-known program analysis techniques such as metadata, static, and dynamic analysis to study registry abuse. Our initial efforts found 339 new malicious packages that we reported to the registries for removal. The package manager maintainers confirmed 278 (82%) from the 339 reported packages where three of them had more than 100,000 downloads. For these packages we were issued official CVE numbers to help expedite the removal of these packages from infected victims. We outline the challenges of tailoring program analysis tools to interpreted languages and release our pipeline as a reference point for the community to build on and help in securing the software supply chain.",

        "title": "Measuring the Deployment of Network Censorship Filters at Global Scale",
        "abstract": "\u2014Content \ufb01ltering technologies are often used for Internet censorship, but even as these technologies have become cheaper and easier to deploy, the censorship measurement community lacks a systematic approach to monitor their proliferation. Past research has focused on a handful of speci\ufb01c \ufb01ltering technologies, each of which required cumbersome manual detective work to identify. Researchers and policymakers require a more comprehensive picture of the state and evolution of censorship based on content \ufb01ltering in order to establish effective policies that protect Internet freedom. In this work, we present FilterMap, a novel framework that can scalably monitor content \ufb01ltering technologies based on their blockpages. FilterMap \ufb01rst compiles in-network and new remote censorship measurement techniques to gather blockpages from \ufb01lter deployments. We then show how the observed blockpages can be clustered, generating signatures for longitudinal tracking. FilterMap outputs a map of regions of address space in which the same blockpages appear (corresponding to \ufb01lter deployments), and each unique blockpage is manually veri\ufb01ed to avoid false positives. By collecting and analyzing more than 379 million measurements from 45,000 vantage points against more than 18,000 sensitive test domains, we are able to identify \ufb01lter deployments associated with 90 vendors and actors and observe \ufb01ltering in 103 countries. We detect the use of commercial \ufb01ltering technologies for censorship in 36 out of 48 countries labeled as \u2018Not Free\u2019 or \u2018Partly Free\u2019 by the Freedom House \u201cFreedom on the Net\u201d report. The unrestricted transfer of content \ufb01ltering technologies have led to high availability, low cost, and highly effective \ufb01ltering techniques becoming easier to deploy and harder to circumvent. Identifying these \ufb01ltering deployments highlights policy and corporate social responsibility issues, and adds accountability to \ufb01lter manufacturers. Our continued publication of FilterMap data will help the international community track the scope, scale and evolution of content-based censorship.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Many wireless communications systems found in aircraft lack standard security mechanisms, leaving them vulnerable to attack. With affordable software-de\ufb01ned radios readily available, a novel threat has emerged which allows a wide range of attackers to easily interfere with wireless avionic systems. Whilst these vulnerabilities are known, predicting their ultimate effect is dif\ufb01cult. A major factor in this effect is how \ufb02ight crew respond, especially whether their extensive training in fault handling helps them to manage attacks. To investigate this we conducted a user study, inviting 30 Airbus A320 type-rated pilots to \ufb02y simulator scenarios in which they were subjected to attacks on their avionics. We use wireless attacks on three safety-related systems, based on existing literature: Traf\ufb01c Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) and the Instrument Landing System (ILS). To analyze their response, we collected control input data coupled with closed and open interview responses. We found that all three attack scenarios created signi\ufb01cant control impact and disruption through missed approaches, avoidance maneuvers and diversions. They further increased workload, distrust in the affected system, and for each attack, at least a third of our participants switched off the system entirely\u2014even if they were important safety systems. All pilots felt the scenarios were useful, with 93.3% feeling that simulator training for wireless attacks could be valuable.",

        "abstract": "\u2014This paper presents Metamorph, a system that generates imperceptible audio that can survive over-the-air transmission to attack the neural network of a speech recognition system. The key challenge stems from how to ensure the added perturbation of the original audio in advance at the sender side is immune to unknown signal distortions during the transmission process. Our empirical study reveals that signal distortion is mainly due to device and channel frequency selectivity but with different characteristics. This brings a chance to capture and further pre-code this impact to generate adversarial examples that are robust to the over-the-air transmission. We leverage this opportunity in Metamorph and obtain an initial perturbation that captures the core distortion\u2019s impact from only a small set of prior measurements, and then take advantage of a domain adaptation algorithm to re\ufb01ne the perturbation to further improve the attack distance and reliability. Moreover, we consider also reducing human perceptibility of the added perturbation. Evaluation achieves a high attack success rate (90%) over the attack distance of up to 6 m. Within a moderate distance, e.g. , 3 m, Metamorph maintains this high success rate, yet can be further adapted to largely improve the audio quality, con\ufb01rmed by a human perceptibility study.",

        "title": "Heterogeneous Private Information Retrieval",
        "abstract": "\u2014Private information retrieval (PIR) enables clients to query and retrieve data from untrusted servers without the untrusted servers learning which data was retrieved. In this paper, we present a new class of multi-server PIR protocols, which we call heterogeneous PIR (HPIR) . In such multi-server PIR protocols, the computation and communication overheads imposed on the PIR servers are non-uniform, i.e., some servers handle higher computation/communication burdens than the others. This enables heterogeneous PIR protocols to be suitable for a range of new PIR applications. What enables us to enforce such heterogeneity is a unique PIR-tailored secret sharing algorithm that we leverage in building our PIR protocol. We have implemented our HPIR protocol and evaluated its performance in comparison with regular (i.e., homogenous) PIR protocols. Our evaluations demonstrate that a querying client can trade off the computation and communication loads of the (heterogeneous) PIR servers by adjusting some parameters. For example in a two server scenario with a heterogeneity degree of 4 / 1 , to retrieve a 456 KB \ufb01le from a 0 . 2 GB database, the rich (i.e., resourceful) PIR server will do 1 . 1 seconds worth of computation compared to 0 . 3 seconds by the poor (resource-constrained) PIR server; this is while each of the servers would do the same 1 seconds of computation in a homogeneous settings. Also, for this given example, our HPIR protocol will impose a 912 KB communication bandwidth on the rich server compared to 228 KB on the poor server (by contrast to 456 KB overheads on each of the servers for a traditional homogeneous design).",

        "title": "TKPERM: Cross-platform Permission Knowledge Transfer to Detect Overprivileged Third-party Applications",
        "abstract": "Permission-based access control enables users to manage and control their sensitive data for third-party applications. In an ideal scenario, third-party application includes enough details to illustrate the usage of such data, while the reality is that many descriptions of third-party applications are vague about their security or privacy activities. As a result, users are left with insufficient details when granting sensitive data to these applications. Prior works, such as WHYPER and AutoCog, have addressed the aforementioned problem via a so-called permission correlation system. Such a system correlates thirdparty applications\u2019 description with their requested permissions and determines an application as overprivileged, if a mismatch between the requested permission and the description is found. However, although prior works are successful on their own platforms, such as Android eco-system, they are not directly applicable to new platforms, such as Chrome extensions and IFTTT, without extensive data labeling and parameter tuning. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate a novel system, called TKPERM, which transfers knowledges of permission correlation systems across platforms. Our key idea is that these varied platforms with different use cases\u2014like smartphones, IoTs, and desktop browsers\u2014are all user-facing and thus allow the knowledges to be transferrable across platforms. Particularly, we adopt a greedy selection algorithm that picks the best source domains to transfer to the target permission on a new platform. TKPERM achieves 90.02% overall F1 score after transfer, which is 12.62% higher than the one of a model trained directly on the target domain without transfer. Particularly, TKPERM has 91.83% F1 score on IFTTT, 89.13% F1 score on Chrome-Extension, and 89.1% F1 score on SmartThings. TKPERM also successfully identified many real-world overprivileged applications, such as a gaming hub requesting location permissions without legitimate use.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Software-De\ufb01ned Networking (SDN) greatly meets the need in industry for programmable, agile, and dynamic networks by deploying diversi\ufb01ed SDN applications on a centralized controller. However, SDN application ecosystem inevitably introduces new security threats since compromised or malicious applications can signi\ufb01cantly disrupt network operations. Thus, a number of effective security enhancement systems have been developed to defend against potential attacks from SDN applications. In this paper, we identify a new vulnerability on \ufb02ow rule installation in SDN, namely, buffered packet hijacking , which can be exploited by malicious applications to launch effective attacks bypassing all existing defense systems. The root cause of this vulnerability lies in that SDN systems do not check the inconsistency between buffer IDs and match \ufb01elds when an application attempts to install \ufb02ow rules. Thus, a malicious application can manipulate buffer IDs to hijack buffered packets even though they do not match any installed \ufb02ow rules. We design effective attacks exploiting this vulnerability to disrupt all three SDN layers, i.e., application layer, data plane layer, and control layer. First, by modifying buffered packets and resending them to controllers, a malicious application can poison other applications. Second, by manipulating forwarding behaviors of buffered packets, a malicious application can not only disrupt TCP connections of \ufb02ows but also make \ufb02ows bypass network security policies. Third, by copying massive buffered packets to controllers, a malicious application can saturate the bandwidth of SDN control channels and their computing resources. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of these attacks with both theoretical analysis and experiments in a real SDN testbed. Finally, we develop a lightweight defense system that can be readily deployed in existing SDN controllers as a patch",

        "abstract": "We assess the security of machine learning based biometric authentication systems against an attacker who submits uniform random inputs, either as feature vectors or raw inputs, in order to find an accepting sample of a target user. The average false positive rate (FPR) of the system, i.e., the rate at which an impostor is incorrectly accepted as the legitimate user, may be interpreted as a measure of the success probability of such an attack. However, we show that the success rate is often higher than the FPR. In particular, for one reconstructed biometric system with an average FPR of 0.03, the success rate was as high as 0.78. This has implications for the security of the system, as an attacker with only the knowledge of the length of the feature space can impersonate the user with less than 2 attempts on average. We provide detailed analysis of why the attack is successful, and validate our results using four different biometric modalities and four different machine learning classifiers. Finally, we propose mitigation techniques that render such attacks ineffective, with little to no effect on the accuracy of the system.",

As control plane decisions are often based on the data plane, it is possible for carefully crafted malicious data plane inputs to direct the control plane towards unwanted states that bypass network security restrictions ( i.e., cross-plane attacks ). Unfortunately, because of the complex interplay among controllers, apps, and data plane inputs, at present it is dif\ufb01cult to systematically identify and analyze these cross-plane vulnerabilities. We present E VENT S COPE , a vulnerability detection tool that automatically analyzes SDN control plane event usage, discovers candidate vulnerabilities based on missing event-handling routines, and validates vulnerabilities based on data plane effects. To accurately detect missing event handlers without ground truth or developer aid, we cluster apps according to similar event usage and mark inconsistencies as candidates. We create an event \ufb02ow graph to observe a global view of events and control \ufb02ows within the control plane and use it to validate vulnerabilities that affect the data plane. We applied E VENT S COPE to the ONOS SDN controller and uncovered 14 new vulnerabilities.",

        "title": "CDN Judo: Breaking the CDN DoS Protection with Itself",
        "abstract": "A content delivery network (CDN) improves the accessing performance and availability of websites via its globally distributed network infrastructures, which contributes to the thriving of CDN-powered websites on the Internet. Because CDNpowered websites normally operate important businesses or critical services, attackers are mostly interested in taking down these high-value websites, to achieve severe damage with maximum influence. Because the CDN absorbs distributed attacking traffic with its massive bandwidth resources, it is commonly believed that CDN vendors provide effective DoS protection for the CDNpowered websites. However, we reveal that implementation or protocol weaknesses in the forwarding mechanisms of the CDN can be exploited to break this CDN protection. By sending crafted but legal requests, an attacker can launch an efficient DoS attack against the website origin behind it. In particular, we present three CDN threats in this study. By abusing the HTTP/2 requestconverting behavior and HTTP pre-POST behavior of a CDN, an attacker can saturate the CDN\u2013origin bandwidth and exhaust the connection limits of the origin. What is more concerning is that some CDN vendors use only a small set of traffic forwarding IPs with lower IP-churning rates to establish connections with the origin. This characteristic provides a great opportunity for an attacker to effectively degrade the global availability of a website just by cutting off specific CDN\u2013origin connections. In this work, we examine the CDN request-forwarding behaviors across six well-known CDN vendors and perform real-world experiments to evaluate the severity of the threats. Because the threats are caused by flawed trade-offs made by the CDN vendors between usability and security, we discuss possible mitigation and received positive feedback after responsible disclosure to the aforementioned CDN vendors.",

        "abstract": "\u2014An Unrestricted File Upload (UFU) vulnerability is a critical security threat that enables an adversary to upload her choice of a forged \ufb01le to a target web server. This bug evolves into an Unrestricted Executable File Upload (UEFU) vulnerability when the adversary is able to conduct remote code execution of the uploaded \ufb01le via triggering its URL. We design and implement FUSE, a penetration testing tool designed to discover UFU and UEFU vulnerabilities in server-side PHP web applications. The goal of FUSE is to generate upload requests; each request becomes an exploit payload that triggers a UFU or UEFU vulnerability. However, this approach entails two technical challenges: (1) it should generate an upload request that bypasses all content-\ufb01ltering checks present in a target web application; and (2) it should preserve the execution semantic of the resulting uploaded \ufb01le. We address these technical challenges by mutating standard upload requests with carefully designed mutations that enable the bypassing of content-\ufb01ltering checks and do not tamper with the execution of uploaded \ufb01les. FUSE discovered 30 previously unreported UEFU vulnerabilities, including 15 CVEs from 33 real-world web applications, thereby demonstrating its ef\ufb01cacy in \ufb01nding code execution bugs via \ufb01le uploads.",

        "title": "On Using Application-Layer Middlebox Protocols for Peeking Behind NAT Gateways",
        "abstract": "\u2014Typical port scanning approaches do not achieve a full coverage of all devices connected to the Internet as not all devices are directly reachable via a public (IPv4) address: due to IP address space exhaustion, \ufb01rewalls, and many other reasons, an end-to-end connectivity is not achieved in today\u2019s Internet anymore. Especially Network Address Translation (NAT) is widely deployed in practice and it has the side effect of \u201chiding\u201d devices from being scanned. Some protocols, however, require end-to-end connectivity to function properly and hence several methods were developed in the past to enable crossing network borders. In this paper, we explore how an attacker can take advantage of such application-layer middlebox protocols to access devices located behind these gateways. More speci\ufb01cally, we investigate different methods for identifying such devices by using only legitimate protocol features. We categorize the available protocols into two classes: First, there are persistent protocols that are typically port-forwarding based. Such protocols are used to allow local network devices to open and forward external ports to them. Second, there are non-persistent protocols that are typically proxy-based to route packets between network edges, such as HTTP and SOCKS proxies. We perform a comprehensive, Internet-wide analysis to obtain an accurate overview of how prevalent and widespread such protocols are in practice. Our results indicate that hundreds of thousands of hosts are vulnerable for different types of attacks, e.g., we detect over 400,000 hosts that are likely vulnerable for attacks involving the UPnP IGD protocol. More worrisome, we \ufb01nd empirical evidence that attackers are already actively exploiting such protocols in the wild to access devices located behind NAT gateways. Amongst other \ufb01ndings, we discover that at least 24% of all open Internet proxies are miscon\ufb01gured to allow accessing hosts on non-routable addresses.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks have become a critical threat to the Internet. Due to the increasing number of vulnerable Internet of Things (IoT) devices, attackers can easily compromise a large set of nodes and launch high-volume DDoS attacks from the botnets. State-of-the-art DDoS defenses, however, have not caught up with the fast develop-ment of the attacks. Middlebox-based defenses can achieve high performance with specialized hardware; however, these defenses incur a high cost, and deploying new defenses typically requires a device upgrade. On the other hand, software-based defenses are highly \ufb02exible, but software-based packet processing leads to high performance overheads. In this paper, we propose P OSEIDON , a system that addresses these limitations in today\u2019s DDoS defenses. It leverages emerging programmable switches, which can be recon\ufb01gured in the \ufb01eld without additional hardware upgrade. Users of P OSEIDON can specify their defense strategies in a modular fashion in the form of a set of defense primitives; this can be further customized easily for each network and extended to include new defenses. P OSEIDON then maps the defense primitives to run on programmable switches\u2014and when necessary, on server software\u2014for effective defense. When attacks change, P OSEIDON can recon\ufb01gure the underlying defense primitives to respond to the new attack patterns. Evaluations using our prototype demonstrate that P OSEIDON can effectively defend against high-volume attacks, easily support customization of defense strategies, and adapt to dynamic attacks with low",

        "abstract": "We introduce screen gleaning, a TEMPEST attack in which the screen of a mobile device is read without a visual line of sight, revealing sensitive information displayed on the phone screen. The screen gleaning attack uses an antenna and a software-defined radio (SDR) to pick up the electromagnetic signal that the device sends to the screen to display, e.g., a message with a security code. This special equipment makes it possible to recreate the signal as a gray-scale image, which we refer to as an emage. Here, we show that it can be used to read a security code. The screen gleaning attack is challenging because it is often impossible for a human viewer to interpret the emage directly. We show that this challenge can be addressed with machine learning, specifically, a deep learning classifier. Screen gleaning will become increasingly serious as SDRs and deep learning continue to rapidly advance. In this paper, we demonstrate the security code attack and we propose a testbed that provides a standard setup in which screen gleaning could be tested with different attacker models. Finally, we analyze the dimensions of screen gleaning attacker models and discuss possible countermeasures with the potential to address them.",

        "abstract": "BGP route leaks frequently precipitate serious disruptions to interdomain routing. These incidents have plagued the Internet for decades while deployment and usability issues cripple efforts to mitigate the problem. Peerlock, introduced in 2016, addresses route leaks with a new approach. Peerlock enables filtering agreements between transit providers to protect their own networks without the need for broad cooperation or a trust infrastructure. We outline the Peerlock system and one variant, Peerlock-lite, and conduct live Internet experiments to measure their deployment on the control plane. Our measurements find evidence for significant Peerlock protection between Tier 1 networks in the peering clique, where 48% of potential Peerlock filters are deployed, and reveal that many other networks also deploy filters against Tier 1 leaks. To guide further deployment, we also quantify Peerlock's impact on route leaks both at currently observed levels and under hypothetical future deployment scenarios via BGP simulation. These experiments reveal present Peerlock deployment restricts Tier 1 leak export to 10% or fewer networks for 40% of simulated leaks. Strategic additional Peerlock-lite deployment at all large ISPs (fewer than 1% of all networks), in tandem with Peerlock within the peering clique as deployed, completely mitigates 80% of simulated Tier 1 route leaks.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Reconnaissance is critical for adversaries to prepare attacks causing physical damage in industrial control systems (ICS) like smart power grids. Disrupting reconnaissance is challenging. The state-of-the-art moving target defense (MTD) techniques based on mimicking and simulating system behaviors do not consider the physical infrastructure of power grids and can be easily identi\ufb01ed. To overcome these challenges, we propose physical function virtualization (PFV) that \u201chooks\u201d network interactions with real physical devices and uses these real devices to build lightweight virtual nodes that follow the actual implementation of network stacks, system invariants, and physical state variations in the real devices. On top of PFV, we propose DefRec, a defense mechanism that signi\ufb01cantly increases the effort required for an adversary to infer the knowledge of power grids\u2019 cyber-physical infrastructures. By randomizing communications and crafting decoy data for virtual nodes, DefRec can mislead adversaries into designing damage-free attacks. We implement PFV and DefRec in the ONOS network operating system and evaluate them in a cyber-physical testbed, using real devices from different vendors and HP physical switches to simulate six power grids. The experimental results show that with negligible overhead, PFV can accurately follow the behavior of real devices. DefRec can delay adversaries\u2019 reconnaissance for more than 100 years by adding a number of virtual nodes less than or equal to 20% of the number of real devices.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the traditional way to unlock car doors has been replaced with a keyless entry system which proves more convenient for automobile owners. When a driver with a key fob is in the vicinity of the vehicle, doors automatically unlock on user command. However, unfortunately, it has been shown that these keyless entry systems are vulnerable to signal relaying attacks. While it is evident that automobile manufacturers incorporate preventative methods to secure these keyless entry systems, they continue to be vulnerable to a range of attacks. Relayed signals result in valid packets that are verified as legitimate, and this makes it is difficult to distinguish a legitimate door unlock request from a malicious signal. In response to this vulnerability, this paper presents an RF fingerprinting method (coined HOld the DOoR, HODOR) to detect attacks on keyless entry systems the first attempt to exploit the RF fingerprint technique in the automotive domain. HODOR is designed as a sub authentication method that supports existing authentication systems for keyless entry systems and does not require any modification of the main system to perform. Through a series of experiments, the results demonstrate that HODOR competently and reliably detects attacks on keyless entry systems. HODOR achieves both an average false positive rate (FPR) of 0.27 percent with a false negative rate (FNR) of 0 percent for the detection of simulated attacks, corresponding to current research on keyless entry car theft.",

        "abstract": "Mobile-application fingerprinting of network traffic is valuable for many security solutions as it provides insights into the apps active on a network. Unfortunately, existing techniques require prior knowledge of apps to be able to recognize them. However, mobile environments are constantly evolving, i.e., apps are regularly installed, updated, and uninstalled. Therefore, it is infeasible for existing fingerprinting approaches to cover all apps that may appear on a network. Moreover, most mobile traffic is encrypted, shows similarities with other apps, e.g., due to common libraries or the use of content delivery networks, and depends on user input, further complicating the fingerprinting process. As a solution, we propose FlowPrint, a semi-supervised approach for fingerprinting mobile apps from (encrypted) network traffic. We automatically find temporal correlations among destination-related features of network traffic and use these correlations to generate app fingerprints. Our approach is able to fingerprint previously unseen apps, something that existing techniques fail to achieve. We evaluate our approach for both Android and iOS in the setting of app recognition, where we achieve an accuracy of 89.2%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art solutions. In addition, we show that our approach can detect previously unseen apps with a precision of 93.5%, detecting 72.3% of apps within the first five minutes of communication.",
