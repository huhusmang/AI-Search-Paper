        "abstract": "Current utilization of multimedia learning environment focuses on student-centered approach. This approach is based on a theory stating that learning styles affect individuals in information processing. Based on prior works, there are three main approaches to distinguish learning styles: conventional approach\u2014such as interview and self-reporting, artificial-intelligence-based approach, and sensor-based approach. Unfortunately, there is no comparative analysis that addresses strengths and limitations of these approaches. Thus, there is no information on how and when to use these approaches appropriately. To address this limitation, we present a brief literature review of several studies in distinguishing learning styles, including their strengths and limitations. We also present insights on potential methods of detecting learning styles in multimedia learning based on eye movement data and machine learning algorithms. Our paper is useful as a guideline for developing intelligent e-learning systems based on eye tracking and machine learning.",

        "title": "When the Differences in Frequency Domain are Compensated: Understanding and Defeating Modulated Replay Attacks on Automatic Speech Recognition",
        "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have been widely deployed in modern smart devices to provide convenient and diverse voice-controlled services. Since ASR systems are vulnerable to audio replay attacks that can spoof and mislead ASR systems, a number of defense systems have been proposed to identify replayed audio signals based on the speakers' unique acoustic features in the frequency domain. In this paper, we uncover a new type of replay attack called modulated replay attack, which can bypass the existing frequency domain based defense systems. The basic idea is to compensate for the frequency distortion of a given electronic speaker using an inverse filter that is customized to the speaker's transform characteristics. Our experiments on real smart devices confirm the modulated replay attacks can successfully escape the existing detection mechanisms that rely on identifying suspicious features in the frequency domain. To defeat modulated replay attacks, we design and implement a countermeasure named DualGuard. We discover and formally prove that no matter how the replay audio signals could be modulated, the replay attacks will either leave ringing artifacts in the time domain or cause spectrum distortion in the frequency domain. Therefore, by jointly checking suspicious features in both frequency and time domains, DualGuard~can successfully detect various replay attacks including the modulated replay attacks. We implement a prototype of DualGuard~on a popular voice interactive platform, ReSpeaker Core v2. The experimental results show DualGuard~can achieve 98% accuracy on detecting modulated replay attacks.",

        "title": "PDiff: Semantic-based Patch Presence Testing for Downstream Kernels",
        "abstract": "Open-source kernels have been adopted by massive downstream vendors on billions of devices. However, these vendors often omit or delay the adoption of patches released in the mainstream version. Even worse, many vendors are not publicizing the patching progress or even disclosing misleading information. However, patching status is critical for groups (e.g., governments and enterprise users) that are keen to security threats. Such a practice motivates the need for reliable patch presence testing for downstream kernels. Currently, the best means of patch presence testing is to examine the existence of a patch in the target kernel by using the code signature match. However, such an approach cannot address the key challenges in practice. Specifically, downstream vendors widely customize the mainstream code and use non-standard building configurations, which often change the code around the patching sites such that the code signatures are ineffective. In this work, we propose PDiff, a system to perform highly reliable patch presence testing with downstream kernel images. Technically speaking, PDiff generates summaries carrying the semantics related to a target patch. Based on the semantic summaries, PDiff compares the target kernel with its mainstream version before and after the adoption of the patch, preferring the closer reference version to determine the patching status. Unlike previous research on patch presence testing, our approach examines similarity based on the semantics of patches and therefore, provides high tolerance to code-level variations. Our test with 398 kernel images corresponding to 51 patches shows that PDiff can achieve high accuracy with an extremely low rate of false negatives and zero false positives. This significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art tool. More importantly, PDiff demonstrates consistently high effectiveness when code customization and non-standard building configurations occur.",

        "abstract": "Clouds and massive-scale computing infrastructures are starting to dominate computing and will likely continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Major cloud operators are now comprising millions of cores hosting substantial fractions of corporate and government IT infrastructure. CCSW is the world's premier forum bringing together researchers and practitioners in all security aspects of cloud-centric and outsourced computing, including: Side channel attacks; Practical cryptographic protocols for cloud security; Secure cloud resource virtualization mechanisms; Secure data management outsourcing (e.g., database as a service); Practical privacy and integrity mechanisms for outsourcing; Foundations of cloud-centric threat models; Secure computation outsourcing; Remote attestation mechanisms in clouds; Sandboxing and VM-based enforcements; Trust and policy management in clouds; Secure identity management mechanisms; New cloud-aware web service security paradigms and mechanisms; Cloud-centric regulatory compliance issues and mechanisms; Business and security risk models and clouds; Cost and usability models and their interaction with security in clouds; Scalability of security in global-size clouds; Trusted computing technology and clouds; Binary analysis of software for remote attestation and cloud protection; Network security (DOS, IDS etc.) mechanisms for cloud contexts; Security for emerging cloud programming models; Energy/cost/efficiency of security in clouds; Machine learning for cloud protection CCSW especially encourages novel paradigms and controversial ideas that are not on the above list. The workshop has historically acted as a fertile ground for creative debate and interaction in security-sensitive areas of computing impacted by clouds. This year marked the 11th anniversary of CCSW. In the past decade, CCSW has had a significant impact in our research community. As of August 2019, in the Google Scholar Metrics entry for ACM CCS (which encompasses CCSW), 20% of the top 20 cited papers come from CCSW. One way to look at it is that authors are as likely or perhaps more likely to have a top-20 paper publishing in CCSW than in CCS! This year, CCSW received 40 submissions out of which 12 full papers (30%) and 5 blitz abstracts were accepted.",

        "title": "TrafficSliver: Fighting Website Fingerprinting Attacks with Traffic Splitting",
        "abstract": "Website fingerprinting (WFP) aims to infer information about the content of encrypted and anonymized connections by observing patterns of data flows based on the size and direction of packets. By collecting traffic traces at a malicious Tor entry node --- one of the weakest adversaries in the attacker model of Tor --- a passive eavesdropper can leverage the captured meta-data to reveal the websites visited by a Tor user. As recently shown, WFP is significantly more effective and realistic than assumed. Concurrently, former WFP defenses are either infeasible for deployment in real-world settings or defend against specific WFP attacks only. To limit the exposure of Tor users to WFP, we propose novel lightweight WFP defenses, TrafficSliver, which successfully counter today's WFP classifiers with reasonable bandwidth and latency overheads and, thus, make them attractive candidates for adoption in Tor. Through user-controlled splitting of traffic over multiple Tor entry nodes, TrafficSliver limits the data a single entry node can observe and distorts repeatable traffic patterns exploited by WFP attacks. We first propose a network-layer defense, in which we apply the concept of multipathing entirely within the Tor network. We show that our network-layer defense reduces the accuracy from more than 98% to less than 16% for all state-of-the-art WFP attacks without adding any artificial delays or dummy traffic. We further suggest an elegant client-side application-layer defense, which is independent of the underlying anonymization network. By sending single HTTP requests for different web objects over distinct Tor entry nodes, our application-layer defense reduces the detection rate of WFP classifiers by almost 50 percentage points. Although it offers lower protection than our network-layer defense, it provides a security boost at the cost of a very low implementation overhead and is fully compatible with today's Tor network.",

        "abstract": "The workshop on \"Attacks and Solutions in HardwarE Security\"(ASHES) welcomes any theoretical and practical works on hardware security, including attacks, solutions, countermeasures, proofs, classification, formalization, and implementations. Besides mainstream research, ASHES puts some focus on new and emerging scenarios: This includes the internet of things (IoT), nuclear weapons inspections, arms control, consumer and infrastructure security, or supply chain security, among others. ASHES also welcomes dedicated works on special purpose hardware, such as lightweight, low-cost, and energy-efficient devices, or non-electronic security systems. The workshop hosts four different paper categories: Apart from regular and short papers, this includes works that systematize and structure a certain (sub-)area (so-called \"Systematization of Knowledge\" (SoK) papers), and so-termed \"Wild and Crazy\" (WaC) papers, which distribute seminal ideas at an early conceptual stage. This summary gives a brief overview of the fourth edition of the workshop, which will take place virtually on November 13, 2020, as a post-conference satellite workshop of ACM CCS.",

        "abstract": "Precision agriculture concept using robotics technology has attracted much interest. The concept requires increasing crop yield and quality while reducing labor costs by better cultivating the farmland using robotics technology. The first step of such technology requires sophisticated maps to get better accuracy. Conventional maps, such as scale maps and topological maps, are susceptible to noise and might not represent the real terrain of farmland, while digital terrain models acquired from satellites and other advanced acquisition devices are quite costly. In this paper, a system of an automatic trajectories generator for the paths of ground robots is developed. Aerial images taken from drones are employed to reconstruct a map that better representing the real terrain. A contour detector is then developed to get the farm boundaries, which are then followed by generating trajectories to be sent to the ground robots. We believe that this work will bring many benefits to agriculture.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and data mining to security and privacy problems. The analytic tools and intelligent behavior provided by these techniques make AI and ML increasingly important for autonomous real-time analysis and decision making in domains with a wealth of data or that require quick reactions to constantly changing situations. The use of learning methods in security-sensitive domains, in which adversaries may attempt to mislead or evade intelligent machines, creates new frontiers for security research. The recent widespread adoption of \"deep learning'' techniques, whose security properties are difficult to reason about directly, has only added to the importance of this research. In addition, data mining and machine learning techniques create a wealth of privacy issues, due to the abundance and accessibility of data. The AISec workshop provides a venue for presenting and discussing new developments in the intersection of security and privacy with AI and machine learning.",

        "title": "Information Leakage in Embedding Models",
        "abstract": "Embeddings are functions that map raw input data to low-dimensional vector representations, while preserving important semantic information about the inputs. Pre-training embeddings on a large amount of unlabeled data and fine-tuning them for downstream tasks is now a de facto standard in achieving state of the art learning in many domains. We demonstrate that embeddings, in addition to encoding generic semantics, often also present a vector that leaks sensitive information about the input data. We develop three classes of attacks to systematically study information that might be leaked by embeddings. First, embedding vectors can be inverted to partially recover some of the input data. As an example, we show that our attacks on popular sentence embeddings recover between 50%--70% of the input words (F1 scores of 0.5--0.7). Second, embeddings may reveal sensitive attributes inherent in inputs and independent of the underlying semantic task at hand. Attributes such as authorship of text can be easily extracted by training an inference model on just a handful of labeled embedding vectors. Third, embedding models leak moderate amount of membership information for infrequent training data inputs. We extensively evaluate our attacks on various state-of-the-art embedding models in the text domain. We also propose and evaluate defenses that can prevent the leakage to some extent at a minor cost in utility.",

However, none of them addresses the influence of an insider over other individuals, and the spread of impact due to direct and indirect access to enterprise assets by having such influence. In this work, we propose a graph-based influence profiling solution called rProfiler that analyzes the data from multiple sources to determine the influence spread and calculate the probability of loss of data from an affected device using pertinent graph features.

        "title": "Continuous Release of Data Streams under both Centralized and Local Differential Privacy",
        "abstract": "We study the problem of publishing a stream of real-valued data satisfying differential privacy (DP). One major challenge is that the maximal possible value in the stream can be quite large, leading to enormous DP noise and bad utility. To reduce the maximal value and noise, one way is to estimate a threshold so that values above it can be truncated. The intuition is that, in many scenarios, only a few values are large; thus truncation does not change the original data much. We develop such a method that finds a suitable threshold with DP. Given the threshold, we then propose an online hierarchical method and several post-processing techniques. Building on these ideas, we formalize the steps in a framework for the private publishing of streaming data. Our framework consists of three components: a threshold optimizer that privately estimates the threshold, a perturber that adds calibrated noise to the stream, and a smoother that improves the result using post-processing. Within our framework, we also design an algorithm satisfying the more stringent DP setting called local DP. Using four real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our mechanism outperforms the state-of-the-art by a factor of $6-10$ orders of magnitude in terms of utility (measured by the mean squared error of the typical scenario of answering a random range query).",

Gaze-based input gives benefit for motion-impaired people and provides faster and intuitive interaction with an application content. Developing gaze-based interactive applications has to deal with several challenges: data processing, eye movements classification, and action. Smooth pursuit eye movement has been used as one of primary input modalities for gaze-based interactive applications. In developing smooth-pursuit-based interactive applications, challenge in the event classification is important to be addressed. However, there is no survey paper that studies various event detection methods in smooth-pursuit-based interactive applications. To tackle this research gap, we present a brief literature review of some event detection methods that consider smooth pursuit eye movement. This paper also presents a preliminary comparison of event detection methods based on some properties that are needed in smooth-pursuit-based interactive applications. From the preliminary comparison, there are some considerations to be taken in to account in order to develop smooth-pursuit-based interactive applications.",

In this mini-review, we highlighted some pyrazole derivatives\nthat have shown remarkable performance in this area; from the detection of chromium (III) with\nlimits of detection of 37 \u00d7 10-12 M to sensing glutathione in biological samples, as well as small\nmolecule labeling of drugs and identifying unhealthy cells such as HeLa and labeling subcellular\norganelles. Evidently, this important class of N-heterocyclic compounds is part of interesting applications.\n",

Ese cambio afecta de un modo directo a las universidades y a los procesos de produccion del conocimiento. No obstante, en el caso espanol esto no es asi porque sus universidades son esencialmente universidades publicas controladas por funcionarios, que no estan sufriendo cambios ni ajustes al mercado. En las universidades espanolas se esta desarrollando una ideologia que ha creado el fetichismo del mercado como instrumento para conseguir el control y la alienacion de las comunidades academicas. Esa ideologia es una representacion invertida de la realidad academica. Se lleva a cabo un estudio del panorama general de la economia global y se muestra, siguiendo los conceptos marxistas de ideologia, fetichismo y alienacion como se estructuran las relaciones de poder en las universidades espanolas.",

        "title": "Is the Classical GMW Paradigm Practical? The Case of Non-Interactive Actively Secure 2PC",
        "abstract": "One of the most challenging aspects in secure computation is offering protection against active adversaries, who may arbitrarily alter the behavior of corrupted parties. A powerful paradigm due to Goldreich, Micali, and Wigderson (GMW), is to follow a two-step approach: (1) design a passively secure protocol \u03c0 for the task at hand; (2) apply a general compiler to convert \u03c0 into an actively secure protocol \u03c0' for the same task. In this work, we implement the first two-party actively secure protocol whose design is based on the general GMW paradigm. Our implementation applies to a passively secure \u03c0 based on garbled circuits, using a sublinear zero-knowledge proof to ensure correctness of garbling. The main variant of our protocol makes a black-box use of an underlying oblivious transfer primitive by following the \"certified oblivious transfer\" blueprint of Ishai et al. (Eurocrypt 2011) and Hazay et. al. (TCC 2017). We also analyze a conceptually simpler but less efficient variant that makes a non-black-box use of oblivious transfer. Our protocol has several important advantages. It supports non-interactive secure computation (NISC), where a receiver posts an \"encryption\" of its input and gets back from a sender an \"encryption\" of the output. The efficiency of this NISC protocol is enhanced by using an offline non-interactive preprocessing, where the sender publishes a single garbled circuit together with a proof of correctness, while the receiver need not even be online. The online work of both the sender and the receiver is lightweight, with a small overhead compared Yao's passively secure protocol depending mostly on the input size rather than the circuit size.",

        "abstract": "Pairing-based cryptography is widely used for its efficiency and functionality. When designing pairing-based schemes, one common task is to devise algorithms for verifying a set of untrusted group elements with respect to a set of trusted group elements. One might be searching for a verification algorithm for a signature scheme or a method for verifying an IBE/ABE private key with respect to the IBE/ABE public parameters. In ACM CCS 2019 Hohenberger Vusirikala, the AutoPPE software tool was introduced for automatically generating a set of pairing product equations (PPEs) that can verify the correctness of a set of pairing group elements with respect to a set of trusted group elements. This task is non-trivial. Some schemes (e.g., those based on dual system encryption) provably do not support any efficient algorithm for verifying the private keys with respect to the public parameters. Other schemes (e.g., the Boyen-Waters anonymous IBE) were left in a gray area by Hohenberger-Vusirikala (CCS 19) -- no conjunction of PPEs was known for testing them, but no proof of untestability either. In this work, we significantly generalize and expand on the foundation of Hohenberger-Vusirikala (CCS 19). Specifically, we consider a larger space of verification algorithms, which we call PPE Circuits, to verify a set of untrusted group elements with respect to a set of trusted group elements. Informally, a PPE Circuit supports AND, OR, NOT and PPE gates, thus capturing all of the capability of AutoPPE while novelly enabling the verification algorithm to include arbitrary logic (as opposed to only conjunctions of PPEs). Our contributions include a formalization of PPE circuits, a provably-correct algorithm for searching for a PPE circuit given a description of the trusted and untrusted elements to be verified, and a new open-source software tool called AutoCircuitPPE that realizes this algorithm. AutoCircuitPPE was tested on a host of test cases and it output PPE circuits for all \"gray area\" schemes left unresolved in Hohenberger-Vusirikala (CCS 19) as well as several new test cases, usually in 100 seconds or less.",

For the purpose, an experimental equipment is prepared, and data acquisition is performed for system identification of the proposed model. The myoelectric potential is measured at the time of palmar flexion-dorsiflexion movement of the wrist, and the signal processing of the acquired myoelectric potential and joint probability density function between movements are derived. As a result, we derive a Gaussian mixture distribution from the joint probability density function and construct a model of motion discrimination at the wrist joint by Markov process.",

        "abstract": "Existing conversation systems have difficulty in communicating smoothly. One of the reasons is that the robot cannot recognize the conversation breakdown. To solve this problem, we attempt to detect conversation breakdown using human motion characteristics. According to our preliminary research, features were found in head Yaw movement when conversation breakdown occurred. As a result of FFT analysis of yaw data, the low-frequency power was different between normal conversation and conversation breakdown. Based on this finding, the energy rate, which relatively expresses the magnitude of the frequency power, was defined. The conversation breakdown detector was developed to estimate conversation breakdown when the z-test shows a difference between the energy rate of normal conversation and the energy rate of the conversation breakdown.",

        "abstract": "Phishing websites are still a major threat in today's Internet ecosystem. Despite numerous previous efforts, similarity-based detection methods do not offer sufficient protection for the trusted websites, in particular against unseen phishing pages. This paper contributes VisualPhishNet, a new similarity-based phishing detection framework, based on a triplet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). VisualPhishNet learns profiles for websites in order to detect phishing websites by a similarity metric that can generalize to pages with new visual appearances. We furthermore present VisualPhish, the largest dataset to date that facilitates visual phishing detection in an ecologically valid manner. We show that our method outperforms previous visual similarity phishing detection approaches by a large margin while being robust against a range of evasion attacks.",

Yet, the aspects of the machine learning pipeline that ultimately determine the performance of the model---feature selection and representation, model selection, and parameter tuning---remain manual and painstaking. This paper presents a method to automate many aspects of traffic analysis, making it easier to apply machine learning techniques to a wider variety of traffic analysis tasks. We introduce nPrint, a tool that generates a unified packet representation that is amenable for representation learning and model training. We integrate nPrint with automated machine learning (AutoML), resulting in nPrintML, a public system that largely eliminates feature extraction and model tuning for a wide variety of traffic analysis tasks. We have evaluated nPrintML on eight separate traffic analysis tasks and released nPrint, nPrintML and the corresponding datasets from our evaluation to enable future work to extend these methods.",

        "abstract": "Fake base station (FBS) has been exploited by criminals to attack mobile users by spamming fraudulent messages for over a decade. Despite that prior work has proposed several techniques to mitigate this issue, FBS spam is still a long-standing challenging issue in some countries, such as China, and causes billions of dollars of financial loss every year. Therefore, understanding and exploring the thematic strategies in the FBS spam ecosystem at a large scale would improve the defense mechanisms. In this paper, we present the first large-scale characterization of FBS spam ecosystem by collecting three-month real-world FBS detection results. First, at \"macro-level'', we uncover the characteristics of FBS spammers, including their business categories, temporal patterns and spatial patterns. Second, at \"micro-level'', we investigate how FBS ecosystem is organized and how fraudulent messages are constructed by campaigns to trap users and evade detection. Collectively, the results expand our understanding of the FBS spam ecosystem and provide new insights into improved mitigation mechanisms for the security community.",

        "abstract": "Successful deployment of Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology in several Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) scenarios, such as Outage Management System (OMS) in smart metering, rely on low energy consumption of the end device. In this work, we conducted an experiment to demonstrate an on-off Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack to analyze the impact on the energy consumption of the LoRaWAN end device. We implemented the attack that manipulates the end device to remain in packet retransmission mode for several seconds. The conducted experiments show that the configurable parameters of LoRaWAN that are required for applications, like OMS, are susceptible to energy consumption attacks. In summary, our results show that when an on-off DoS attack is performed, the end device utilizing the Spreading Factor (SF) 12 consumes 92 times more energy due to packet retransmissions as compared to the end node using SF 7 under no attack.",

        "abstract": "The number of cybersecurity threats has been increasing, and these threats have become more sophisticated year after year. Malicious hosts play a large role in modern cyberattacks, e.g., as a launcher of remote-control attacks or as a receiver of stolen information. In such circumstances, continuous monitoring of malicious hosts (URL/IP addresses) is indispensable to reveal cyberattack activities, and many studies have been conducted on that. However, many of them have limitations: they help only in the short-term or they help only a few regions and/or a few organizations. Therefore, we cannot effectively monitor attacks that are active for only a short time or that change their behavior depending on where the victims are from (e.g., country/organization). In this paper, we propose Stargazer, a program that monitors malicious hosts from multiple points on a long-term basis. Multiregional monitoring sensors and inter-organizational collaboration are conducted to achieve this surveillance. In this paper, we describe an implementation of the Stargazer prototype and how monitoring was carried out using multiregional sensors starting in Dec. 2018 of 1,050 malicious hosts; 10,929,418 measurements were obtained. Case studies on (1) revived hosts, (2) hosts that only respond to specific regions, and (3) the behavior of attack preparation were created.",

Now, with humanity facing a pandemic, it becomes even more vital to provide health care workers and first responders with low-cost and robust methods to protect themselves and help stop the spread of a disease that is ravaging our lives and economies. There are high expectations that Artificial Intelligence will be the game changing technology that will make sense of the plethora of disparate sources of data being collected about individuals, communities and the environment and that it will help solve all of these problems. Meanwhile, coupling AI with robotics is anticipated to be the foundation for a future contactless society that will mitigate the spread of diseases and keep us healthier. However, AI is not a box that can magically produce these solutions and building trustworthy AI comes with many challenges. This talk will discuss those challenges and explore some of the pathways forward to best utilize AI and its promise to advance robotics to conquer societal challenges.",

        "abstract": "Control-flow integrity (CFI) is a promising technique to mitigate control-flow hijacking attacks. In the past decade, dozens of CFI mechanisms have been proposed by researchers. Despite the claims made by themselves, the security promises of these mechanisms have not been carefully evaluated, and thus are questionable. In this paper, we present a solution to measure the gap between the practical security and the claimed theoretical security. First, we propose CScan to precisely measure runtime feasible targets of indirect control transfer (ICT) instructions protected by CFI, by enumerating all potential code addresses and testing whether ICTs are allowed to jump to them. Second, we propose CBench as a sanity check for verifying CFI solutions? effectiveness against typical attacks, by exploiting a comprehensive set of vulnerable programs protected by CFI and verifying the recognized feasible targets. We evaluated 12 most recent open-source CFI mechanisms and discovered 10 flaws in most CFI mechanisms or implementations. For some CFIs, their security policies or protected ICT sets do not match what they claimed. Some CFIs even expand the attack surface (e.g. introducing unintended targets). To facilitate a deeper understanding of CFI, we summarize the flaws into 7 common pitfalls which cover the whole lifetime of CFI mechanisms and reveal issues that affect CFI mechanisms in practical security.",

        "title": "Slimium: Debloating the Chromium Browser with Feature Subsetting",
        "abstract": "Today, a web browser plays a crucial role in offering a broad spectrum of web experiences. The most popular browser, Chromium, has become an extremely complex application to meet ever-increasing user demands, exposing unavoidably large attack vectors due to its large code base. Code debloating attracts attention as a means of reducing such a potential attack surface by eliminating unused code. However, it is very challenging to perform sophisticated code removal without breaking needed functionalities because Chromium operates on a large number of closely connected and complex components, such as a renderer and JavaScript engine. In this paper, we present Slimium, a debloating framework for a browser (i.e., Chromium) that harnesses a hybrid approach for a fast and reliable binary instrumentation. The main idea behind Slimium is to determine a set of features as a debloating unit on top of a hybrid (i.e., static, dynamic, heuristic) analysis, and then leverage feature subsetting to code debloating. It aids in i) focusing on security-oriented features, ii) discarding unneeded code simply without complications, and iii)~reasonably addressing a non-deterministic path problem raised from code complexity. To this end, we generate a feature-code map with a relation vector technique and prompt webpage profiling results. Our experimental results demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of Slimium for 40 popular websites, as on average it removes 94 CVEs (61.4%) by cutting down 23.85 MB code (53.1%) from defined features (21.7% of the whole) in Chromium.",

Asi, las reformas son estrategias o mecanismos estatales para la absorcion y adaptacion de los lineamientos educativos que se producen en las dinamicas de desarrollo del capitalismo a nivel regional o mundial, mientras que a nivel local, ejerce un rol de regulacion y control sobre los procesos educativos por la via de los campos de conocimiento y contenidos escolares con el proposito de orientar modos de formacion destinados a mantener el orden social existente. Estos procesos suelen legitimarse discursivamente con la dialectica crisis- consenso-fracaso. Este analisis se soporta desde una perspectiva historica de corte marxista, en la que se teje una argumentacion con elementos teoricos sociologicos, juridicos, politologicos, administrativos y educativos.",

        "title": "Strengthening Order Preserving Encryption with Differential Privacy",
        "abstract": "Ciphertexts of an order-preserving encryption (OPE) scheme preserve the order of their corresponding plaintexts. However, OPEs are vulnerable to inference attacks that exploit this preserved order. Differential privacy (DP) has become the de-facto standard for data privacy. One of the most attractive properties of DP is that any post-processing computation, such as inference attacks, performed on the noisy output of a DP algorithm does not degrade its privacy guarantee. In this work, we propose a novel differentially private order preserving encryption scheme, OP \u03b5. Under OP \u03b5, the leakage of order from the ciphertexts is differentially private. Consequently, in the least, OP \u03b5 ensures a formal guarantee (a relaxed DP guarantee) even in the face of inference attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to combine DP with a OPE. OP \u03b5 is based on a novel differentially private order preserving encoding scheme, OP\u03b5c, that can be of independent interest in the local DP setting. We demonstrate OP \u03b5's utility in answering range queries via empirical evaluation on four real-world datasets. For instance, OP \u03b5 misses only around 4 in every 10K correct records on average for a dataset of size ~732K with an attribute of domain size ~18K and \u03b5= 1.",

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices makes it vitally important to understand real-world cybersecurity threats to them. Traditionally, honeypots have been used as decoys to mimic real devices on a network and help researchers/organizations understand the dynamic of threats. A crucial condition for a honeypot to yield useful insights is to let attackers believe they are real systems used by humans and organizations. However, IoT devices pose unique challenges in this respect, due to the large variety of device types and the physical-connectedness nature. In this work, we (1) presented an approach to create a multi-phased multi-faceted honeypot ecosystem, where researchers gradually increase the sophistication of a low-interaction IoT honeypot by observing real-world attackers' behaviors, (2) built a low-interaction honeypot for IoT cameras that allowed researchers to gain a concrete understanding of what attackers were going after on IoT camera devices, and (3) designed a proxy instance, called ProxyPot, that sits between IoT devices and the external network and helps researchers study the IoT devices' inbound/outbound communication. We used PorxyPot as a means to understanding attacks against IoT cameras and increasing the honeypot's sophistication. We deployed honeypots for more than two years. Our preliminary results showed that we were able to attract increasingly sophisticated attack data in each new phase. Moreover, we captured activities that appeared to involve direct human interactions rather than purely automated scripts.",

        "abstract": "Dengue and malaria are mosquito-borne infectious diseases driven by climate change and have an endemic impact in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, particularly in South and South-East Asia. Most studies examined the effect of local climate variability, temperature, and precipitation on dengue and malaria incidence. Nevertheless, the effects of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on dengue incidence are still rarely discussed. Besides, the study of the influence of IOD and ENSO on malaria incidence remain unexplored. This paper examined the influence of IOD and ENSO on the interannual variability of dengue and malaria incidence in all Indonesia provinces using Pearson correlation. Historical time series data on dengue and malaria incidence in all Indonesia provinces from 2005 to 2018 were investigated for time series prediction using deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).",

        "abstract": "We investigate the security of split learning---a novel collaborative machine learning framework that enables peak performance by requiring minimal resource consumption. In the present paper, we expose vulnerabilities of the protocol and demonstrate its inherent insecurity by introducing general attack strategies targeting the reconstruction of clients' private training sets. More prominently, we show that a malicious server can actively hijack the learning process of the distributed model and bring it into an insecure state that enables inference attacks on clients' data. We implement different adaptations of the attack and test them on various datasets as well as within realistic threat scenarios. We demonstrate that our attack can overcome recently proposed defensive techniques aimed at enhancing the security of the split learning protocol. Finally, we also illustrate the protocol's insecurity against malicious clients by extending previously devised attacks for Federated Learning.",

In order to develop a prosthetic hand with the same flexibility as a human hand, we designed the prosthetic hand according to hands anatomical features, and incorporating these structural features into design: prosthetic joints, ligaments and extensor hoods. To evaluate the performance of the proposed prosthetic hand in daily life, a grabbing experiment was conducted on common objects in our daily life.

        "abstract": "Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) is a common attack vector used by attackers to gain higher-level permissions. In this poster, we present a system called LPET to mine LPE vulnerabilities of third-party software in MS-Windows. Our insight is that the LPE is often caused by the interactions between high-privilege processes and user-controllable files. The interactions include creating a file, starting a process and others. Based on this observation, LPET first monitors software behaviors and constructs a directed interaction graph to abstract entities, such as files and processes, and their interactions. Then LPET analyzes exploiting paths from the graph by extracting user-controllable entities and checking their privileges. Finally, LPET verifies the exploiting paths using replacement or hijacking attacks. In the preliminary experiments, LPET found vulnerabilities in various software. Moreover, we discovered a common weakness pattern that some components were executed by software with high privilege after being released in the user-controllable temporary directory during installation, update, and uninstallation. By replacing the components, attackers with low privilege can hijack the execution flow of software to execute their codes with high privilege. We found that a wide range of software suffers from this weakness pattern, including Cisco AnyConnect, Dropbox, Notepad++.",

        "abstract": "\n\nMangroves forests inhabiting the south coast of China are crucial habitats for the functioning\nof the coastal zone. This role has not been carefully considered in China and compared to\ntheir functional role worldwide. China\u2019s mangroves currently occupy 20,303 ha. Average forest biomass\nis equivalent to the global average, but the mean ratio of below-ground to above-ground biomass\nis high (46%), reflecting the young age of most forests. Rates of annual litterfall, net primary\nproductivity, and root production are above the global average, indicating that China\u2019s mangrove\nforests are highly productive within their latitudinal band. High productivity may reflect high\nrates of organic inputs, young forest ages, and high rates of precipitation. As China\u2019s mangrove\nforests have short canopies, these data imply that the rates of forest turnover are more rapid than in\nmost other mangroves. Mangrove organic carbon (Corg) stock averaged 190.96 Mg Corg ha-1, mostly\n(58%) in soils, less than the global average, reflecting young forest age and frequent soil disturbance.\nTotal Corg stored in China\u2019s mangroves is 3.9 Tg, only 0.03% of the global total, but the total\nCorg sequestration rate is 139.4 Gg Corg a-1 while the average Corg sequestration rate is 6.87 Mg Corg\nha-1 a-1, which is greater than the global average. Corg losses via microbial mineralization are large\nas total Corg export from mangroves accounts for 44% of the total Corg exported to the South China\nSea. Nutrients are efficiently retained suggesting their use and proper management as aquaculture\nfilters. Mangroves have close links to other coastal food webs.\n",

        "abstract": "AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) is an emerging security feature of modern AMD processors that allows virtual machines to run with encrypted memory and perform confidential computing even with an untrusted hypervisor. This paper first demystifies SEV's improper use of address space identifier (ASID) for controlling accesses of a VM to encrypted memory pages, cache lines, and TLB entries. We then present the CROSSLINE attacks, a novel class of attacks against SEV that allow the adversary to launch an attacker VM and change its ASID to that of the victim VM to impersonate the victim. We present two variants of CROSSLINE attacks: CROSSLINE V1 decrypts victim's page tables or any memory blocks conforming to the format of a page table entry; CROSSLINE V2 constructs encryption and decryption oracles by executing instructions of the victim VM. We discuss the applicability of CROSSLINE attacks on AMD's SEV, SEV-ES, and SEV-SNP processors.",

        "title": "Examining Mirai's Battle over the Internet of Things",
        "abstract": "Using hundreds of thousands of compromised IoT devices, the Mirai botnet emerged in late 2016 as a game changing threat actor, capable of temporarily taking down major Internet service providers and Internet infrastructure. Since then, dozens of variants of IoT-based botnets have sprung up, and in today's Internet distributed denial-of-service attacks from IoT devices have become a major attack vector. This proliferation was significantly driven by the public distribution of the Mirai source code, which other actors used to create their own, customized version of the original Mirai botnet. In this paper we provide a comprehensive view into the ongoing battle over the Internet of Things fought by Mirai and its many siblings. Using 7,500 IoT honeypots, we show that we can use 300,000,000 compromisation attempts from infected IoT devices as well as a design flaw in Mirai's random number generator to obtain insights into Mirai infections worldwide. We find that networks and the particular malware strains that plague them are tightly connected, and malware authors over time take over strategies from their competitors. The most surprising finding is that epidemiologically, IoT botnets are not self-sustaining: were it not for continuous pushes from bootstrapping, Mirai and its variants would die out.",

In the face of the dynamic increase of data scale, how to measure the characteristic information of data has become an urgent problem to be solved in the field of data mining. This paper focuses on this problem and further studies its incremental learning function on the basis of in-depth discussion of data complexity proposed by TK Ho et al. Among them, N3 and N4 are the complexity indexes based on KNN classifier (K=1). In this paper, the incremental learning algorithm I1NN was proposed on the basis of 1-NN classifier, and its feasibility and validity were verified on both the artificial data set and the UCI public data set.",

        "abstract": "The creation and distribution of child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) involves a continuing violation of the victims? privacy beyond the original harms they document. A large volume of these materials is distributed via the Freenet anonymity network: in our observations, nearly one third of requests on Freenet were for known CSAM. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel approach for investigating these violations of exploited childrens' privacy. Our forensic method distinguishes whether or not a neighboring peer is the actual uploader or downloader of a file or merely a relayer. Our method requires analysis of the traffic sent to a single, passive node only. We evaluate our method extensively. Our in situ measurements of actual CSAM requests show an FPR of 0.002 \u00b1 0.003 for identifying downloaders. And we show an FPR of 0.009 \u00b1 0.018, a precision of 1.00 \u00b1 0.01, and a TPR of 0.44 \u00b1 0.01 for identifying uploaders based on in situ tests. Further, we derive expressions for the FPR and Power of our hypothesis test; perform simulations of single and concurrent downloaders; and characterize the Freenet network to inform parameter selection. We were participants in several United States Federal Court cases in which the use of our method was uniformly upheld.",

        "title": "A Generic Technique for Automatically Finding Defense-Aware Code Reuse Attacks",
        "abstract": "Code reuse attacks have been the subject of a substantial amount of research during the past decade. This research largely resulted from early work on Return-Oriented Programming (ROP), which showed that the then newly proposed Non-Executable Memory (NX) defense could be bypassed. More recently, the research community has been simultaneously investigating new defenses that are believed to thwart code reuse attacks, such as Control Flow Integrity (CFI), and defense-aware techniques for attacking these defenses, such as Data-Oriented Programming (DOP). Unfortunately, the feasibility of defense-aware attacks are very dependent on the behaviors of the attacked program, which makes it difficult for defenders to understand how much protection a defense such as CFI may provide. To better understand this, researchers have introduced automated defense-aware code reuse attack systems. Unfortunately, the handful of existing systems implement a single fixed, defense-specific strategy that is complex and cannot be used to consider other defenses. In this paper, we propose a generic framework for automatically discovering defense-aware code reuse attacks in executables. Unlike existing work, which utilizes hard-coded strategies for specific defenses, our framework can produce attacks for multiple defenses by analyzing the runtime behavior of the defense. The high-level insight behind our framework is that code reuse attacks can be defined as a state reachability problem, and that defenses prevent some transitions between states. We implement our framework as a tool named Limbo, which employs an existing binary concolic executor to solve the reachability problem. We evaluate Limbo and show that it excels when there is little code available for reuse, making it complementary to existing techniques. We show that, in such scenarios, Limbo outperforms existing systems that automate ROP attacks, as well as systems that automate DOP attacks in the presence of fine-grained CFI, despite having no special knowledge about ROP or DOP attacks.",

        "abstract": "Tor exit blocking, in which websites disallow clients arriving from Tor, is a growing and potentially existential threat to the anonymity network. This paper introduces HebTor, a new and robust architecture for exit bridges---short-lived proxies that serve as alternative egress points for Tor. A key insight of HebTor is that exit bridges can operate as Tor onion services, allowing any device that can create outbound TCP connections to serve as an exit bridge, regardless of the presence of NATs and/or firewalls. HebTor employs a micropayment system that compensates exit bridge operators for their services, and a privacy-preserving reputation scheme that prevents freeloading. We show that HebTor effectively thwarts server-side blocking of Tor, and we describe the security, privacy, and legal implications of our design.",

        "abstract": "As a young programming language designed for systems software development, Rust aims to provide safety guarantees like high-level languages and performance efficiency like low-level languages. Lifetime is a core concept in Rust, and it is key to both safety checks and automated resource management conducted by the Rust compiler. However, Rust's lifetime rules are very complex. In reality, it is not uncommon that Rust programmers fail to infer the correct lifetime, causing severe concurrency and memory bugs. In this paper, we present VRLifeTime, an IDE tool that can visualize lifetime for Rust programs and help programmers avoid lifetime-related mistakes. Moreover, VRLifeTime can help detect some lifetime-related bugs (i.e., double locks) with detailed debugging information. A demo video is available at https://youtu.be/L5F_XCOrJTQ.",

        "title": "Speculative Probing: Hacking Blind in the Spectre Era",
        "abstract": "To defeat ASLR or more advanced fine-grained and leakage-resistant code randomization schemes, modern software exploits rely on information disclosure to locate gadgets inside the victim's code. In the absence of such info-leak vulnerabilities, attackers can still hack blind and derandomize the address space by repeatedly probing the victim's memory while observing crash side effects, but doing so is only feasible for crash-resistant programs. However, high-value targets such as the Linux kernel are not crash-resistant. Moreover, the anomalously large number of crashes is often easily detectable. In this paper, we show that the Spectre era enables an attacker armed with a single memory corruption vulnerability to hack blind without triggering any crashes. Using speculative execution for crash suppression allows the elevation of basic memory write vulnerabilities into powerful speculative probing primitives that leak through microarchitectural side effects. Such primitives can repeatedly probe victim memory and break strong randomization schemes without crashes and bypass all deployed mitigations against Spectre-like attacks. The key idea behind speculative probing is to break Spectre mitigations using memory corruption and resurrect Spectre-style disclosure primitives to mount practical blind software exploits. To showcase speculative probing, we target the Linux kernel, a crash-sensitive victim that has so far been out of reach of blind attacks, mount end-to-end exploits that compromise the system with just-in-time code reuse and data-only attacks from a single memory write vulnerability, and bypass strong Spectre and strong randomization defenses. Our results show that it is crucial to consider synergies between different (Spectre vs. code reuse) threat models to fully comprehend the attack surface of modern systems.",

However, several important challenges of using VirusTotal are left unaddressed (e.g., whether VirusTotal labels are already stable, when VirusTotal labels can be trusted), severely harming the correctness of research projects depending on VirusTotal. In this paper, we present VTSet, which contains daily VirusTotal labels on more than 14,000 files over one year. VTSet can be used to build and evaluate various tools to tackle the existing challenges and facilitate the usage of VirusTotal. Besides the data, VTSet also provides a demonstration tool to display many measurement results and a query tool to ease the access of its data.

In order to help the elderly at home, robots should have awareness and react carefully to prevent injury or accidents. The idea of safety strategy in robotics mainly used for industrial environment with less uncertainty. However, the home-care robot deals with many uncertainties condition and it is difficult to predict the human behavior than predict the industrial moving object. Thus, it is important to formulate a systematic approach to improving safety awareness on home-care robots. The following paper describes an approach of safety strategy for robot home manipulation task. This system uses an ecological approach based on the interconnection between perceptual system and action system according to spatial-temporal context of the updated information from environment. Some recommendation and preliminary experiments are conducted to show the possibility of further development for future research.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning has become increasingly prominent and is widely used in various applications in practice. Despite its great success, the integrity of machine learning predictions and accuracy is a rising concern. The reproducibility of machine learning models that are claimed to achieve high accuracy remains challenging, and the correctness and consistency of machine learning predictions in real products lack any security guarantees. In this paper, we initiate the study of zero knowledge machine learning and propose protocols for zero knowledge decision tree predictions and accuracy tests. The protocols allow the owner of a decision tree model to convince others that the model computes a prediction on a data sample, or achieves a certain accuracy on a public dataset, without leaking any information about the model itself. We develop approaches to efficiently turn decision tree predictions and accuracy into statements of zero knowledge proofs. We implement our protocols and demonstrate their efficiency in practice. For a decision tree model with 23 levels and 1,029 nodes, it only takes 250 seconds to generate a zero knowledge proof proving that the model achieves high accuracy on a dataset of 5,000 samples and 54 attributes, and the proof size is around 287 kilobytes.",

This paper proposes a modified version of the three-mode fuzzy clustering for categorical multivariate data (3FCCM) algorithm, which was constructed with the aggregation criterion of three elements based on the fuzzy c-means (FCM) concept and often suffers from careful tuning of three independent fuzzification parameters. In the modified algorithm, a novel clustering criterion is proposed based on a probabilistic concept, where we can easily tune the fuzziness degree of three-mode fuzzy partition by comparing with the probabilistic standard. The characteristics of the two algorithms are discussed through comparative experiments such that the modified version is more useful in tuning the influences of the fuzziness parameters and is more promising in real applications than the conventional one.",

        "abstract": "Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs (ZKP) are foundational in cryptography. Most recent ZK research focuses on non-interactive proofs (NIZK) of small statements, useful in blockchain scenarios. Another line, and our focus, instead targets proofs of large statements that are useful, e.g., in proving properties of programs in ZK. We specify a zero-knowledge processor that executes arbitrary programs written in a simple instruction set, and proves in ZK the correctness of the execution. Such an approach is well-suited for constructing ZK proofs of large statements as it efficiently supports complex programming constructs, such as loops and RAM access. Critically, we propose several novel ZK improvements that make our approach concretely efficient: (1) an efficient arithmetic representation with conversions to/from Boolean, (2) an efficient read-only memory that uses $2\u0142og n$ OTs per access, and (3) an efficient read-write memory, \u00f8urram, which uses $\\frac1 2 \u0142og^2 n$ OTs per access. \u00f8urram beats linear scan for RAM of size $>3$ elements! Prior ZK systems used generic ORAM costing orders of magnitude more. We cast our system as a garbling scheme that can be plugged into the ZK protocol of [Jawurek et al, CCS'13]. Put together, our system is concretely efficient: for a processor instantiated with $512$KB of main memory, each processor cycle costs $24$KB of communication. We implemented our approach in \\textttC++. On a 1Gbps LAN our implementation realizes a $2.1$KHz processor.",

        "title": "Membership Leakage in Label-Only Exposures",
        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has been widely adopted in various privacy-critical applications, e.g., face recognition and medical image analysis. However, recent research has shown that ML models are vulnerable to attacks against their training data. Membership inference is one major attack in this domain: Given a data sample and model, an adversary aims to determine whether the sample is part of the model's training set. Existing membership inference attacks leverage the confidence scores returned by the model as their inputs (score-based attacks). However, these attacks can be easily mitigated if the model only exposes the predicted label, i.e., the final model decision. In this paper, we propose decision-based membership inference attacks and demonstrate that label-only exposures are also vulnerable to membership leakage. In particular, we develop two types of decision-based attacks, namely transfer attack and boundary attack. Empirical evaluation shows that our decision-based attacks can achieve remarkable performance, and even outperform the previous score-based attacks in some cases. We further present new insights on the success of membership inference based on quantitative and qualitative analysis, i.e., member samples of a model are more distant to the model's decision boundary than non-member samples. Finally, we evaluate multiple defense mechanisms against our decision-based attacks and show that our two types of attacks can bypass most of these defenses.",

        "abstract": "We provide a composition framework together with a variety of composition theorems allowing to split the security proof of an unbounded number of sessions of a compound protocol into simpler goals. While many proof techniques could be used to prove the subgoals, our model is particularly well suited to the Computationally Complete Symbolic Attacker (ccsA) model. We address both sequential and parallel composition, with state passing and long term shared secrets between the protocols. We also provide with tools to reduce multi-session security to single session security, with respect to a stronger attacker. As a consequence, our framework allows, for the first time, to perform proofs in the CCSA model for an unbounded number of sessions. To this end, we introduce the notion of O-simulation: a simulation by a machine that has access to an oracle O. Carefully managing the access to long term secrets, we can reduce the security of a composed protocol, for instance P || Q, to the security of P (resp. Q), with respect to an attacker simulating Q (resp. P) using an oracle O. As demonstrated by our case studies the oracle is most of the time quite generic and simple. These results yield simple formal proofs of composed protocols, such as multiple sessions of key exchanges, together with multiple sessions of protocols using the exchanged keys, even when all the parts share long terms secrets (e.g. signing keys). We also provide with a concrete application to the SSH protocol with (a modified) forwarding agent, a complex case of long term shared secrets, which we formally prove secure.",

Impersonation-as-a-Service (IMPaaS) allows attackers to systematically collect and enforce user profiles (consisting of user credentials, cookies, device and behavioural fingerprints, and other metadata) to circumvent risk-based authentication system and effectively bypass multi-factor authentication mechanisms. We present the IMPaaS model and evaluate its implementation by analysing the operation of a large, invite-only, Russian IMPaaS platform providing user profiles for more than 260,000 Internet users worldwide. Our findings suggest that the IMPaaS model is growing, and provides the mechanisms needed to systematically evade authentication controls across multiple platforms, while providing attackers with a reliable, up-to-date, and semi-automated environment enabling target selection and user impersonation against Internet users as scale.",

        "abstract": "The number of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients is about 700,000 in Japan. The modified total sharp score (mTSS) calculated from hand X-ray image is a standard diagnosis method of RA progression but can be time-consuming for physicians. Computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system is expected to improve the diagnostic quality of RA patients. We have previously proposed a CAD system, which can detect finger joint positions using support vector machine and estimate mTSS using support vector regression. This study improves the finger joint detection accuracy by incorporating with statistical shape model, which statistically models individual variety of spatial relationship among finger joints. Experimental results on radiographic images of the hands of 90 RA patients showed that the finger joints were detected with an accuracy of 94.5%, which is higher than 90.6% of the accuracy with the previous method.",

        "title": "Harnessing the Ambient Radio Frequency Noise for Wearable Device Pairing",
        "abstract": "Wearable devices that capture user's rich information regarding their health conditions and daily activities have unmet pairing needs. Today's solutions, which primarily rely on human involvement, are cumbersome, error-prone, and do not scale well. Despite some prior efforts trying to fill this gap, they either rely on some sophisticated sensors, such as electromyogram (EMG) or electrocardiogram (ECG) pads that may not universally exist, or non-trivial design of communication transceivers that cannot be found easily on current commercial devices. Therefore, a pairing scheme for wearable devices that is secure, practical, and convenient is in dire need. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages ambient radio frequency (RF) noise. Our design is based on a key observation that received RF noise power measured in the logarithmic scale at different parts of a human body surface experience the same variation trend, whereas those from different human bodies or off the body are distinct. Wearables make use of the observed noise as the entropy source for the proposed pairing protocol. Extensive experiments show that our scheme has an equal error rate (EER) as low as 1.4% for pairing. Its key generation rate reaches 138 bits/sec, which beats so-far existing pairing schemes. Besides, our scheme can be efficiently executed within 0.97 s. Its incurred energy consumption is as low as 0.27 J for the entire pairing procedure.",

La historia global es la adaptacion de la Historia, como disciplina academica, al marco creado por la globalizacion. Como en otros periodos de globalizacion anteriores, los desequilibrios y dificultades acumulados durante las fases expansivas estan dando paso a procesos desglobalizadores. ?Que enfoque deberia proponer la disciplina historica ante los ultimos acontecimientos? ?Es la historia global una herramienta util? Seguiremos las propuestas y trabajos de varios autores en un intento de dar respuesta a estas preguntas y, tambien, en un intento de comprender mejor el encaje de la historia global en un momento de retroceso de la globalizacion.",

        "abstract": "The demand for an automatic bone fracture detection in the emergency section of the hospitals is high for quick diagnosis while maintaining the quality. Previous studies on fracture detection with computed tomography (CT) images or X-ray images have a performance limitation because those methods are based on 2-D image analysis and cannot consider the 3-D internal structure of pelvic bones. This study proposes an automated bone fracture detection from 3-D CT images. Firstly, it introduces a new 3-D annotation method of fractures (called 3-D surface annotation). By using 3-D shape data of pelvic surfaces, it decreases the annotation load significantly. The proposed method estimates the degree of fracture for each point on the pelvic surface. The degree is estimated by 3-D convolutional neural networks (CNN) using 3-D distribution of CT values inside the pelvic surface. The proposed method was validated by using 103 subjects. The accuracy, precision, recall, and specificity for the test data were 69.5%, 61.1%, 56.4%, and 77.7%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Secure pairing is key to trustworthy deployment and application of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, IoT devices lack conventional user interfaces, such as keyboards and displays, which makes many traditional pairing approaches inapplicable. Proximity-based pairing approaches are very usable, but can be exploited by co-located malicious devices. Approaches based on a user's physical operations on IoT devices are more secure, but typically require inertial sensors, while many devices do not satisfy this requirement. A secure and usable pairing approach that can be applied to heterogeneous IoT devices still does not exist. We develop a technique, Universal Operation Sensing, which allows an IoT device to sense the user's physical operations on it without requiring inertial sensors. With this technique, a user holding a smartphone or wearing a wristband can finish pairing in seconds through some very simple operations, e.g., pressing a button or twisting a knob. Moreover, we reveal an inaccuracy issue in original fuzzy commitment and propose faithful fuzzy commitment to resolve it. We design a pairing protocol using faithful fuzzy commitment, and build a prototype system named Touch-to-Pair (T2Pair, for short). The comprehensive evaluation shows that it is secure and usable.",

        "abstract": "Much research has investigated improving the security and performance of Tor by having Tor clients choose paths through the network in a way that depends on the client's location. However, this approach has been demonstrated to lead to serious deanonymization attacks. Moreover, we show how in some scenarios it can lead to significant performance degradation. For example, we demonstrate that using the recently-proposed Counter-RAPTOR system when guard bandwidth isn't abundant could increase median download times by 28.7%. We propose the CLAPS system for performing client-location-aware path selection, which fixes the known security and performance issues of existing designs. We experimentally compare the security and performance of CLAPS to Counter-RAPTOR and DeNASA. CLAPS puts a strict bound on the leakage of information about the client's location, where the other systems could completely reveal it after just a few connections. It also guarantees a limit on the advantage that an adversary can obtain by strategic relay placement, which we demonstrate to be overwhelming against the other systems. Finally, due to a powerful formalization of path selection as an optimization problem, CLAPS is approaching or even exceeding the original goals of algorithms to which it is applied, while solving their known deficiencies.",

And the social necessity of the robot system is gradually emphasized, especially in the service industry have an intention to use the robot system. However, the usage of robots is rarely expanded in the social place. One of the main reasons is the needs of users who actually use the robots are not determined, and it is not easy to design and use robots to meet the needs of users. Therefore, to consider this problem, we propose the concept that users can conveniently consider the robot hardware design. In this research, we focused on the design selection and fabrication based on modular structured robot partner system. The proposed method is composed of three parts. First, we introduce the development of robot partners in accordance with design thinking. Next, we propose a modular robot partner system in order to meet users\u2019 needs. Finally, we show experimental results of the effectiveness of the robot partner system and discuss the applicability of the proposed system.",

Despite the decreasing cost of high-throughput genotyping, the GS strategy remains\nexpensive due to the need for phenotyping and genotyping for a large number of samples.\nSimulation analysis of genome selection is a popular, lower-cost method to determine an optimal\nbreeding program of GS.\n\n\n\nTo evaluate the utility of simulation data to study the influence of different factors on\nalgorithms. This could be helpful for developing genome selection breeding strategies, especially\nfor stress and resistance traits of fish.\n\n\n\nReal data of orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) were obtained from a previous\ngenome-wide association study. Ammonia tolerance, different population sizes, SNP density,\nQTL number, kinship (base mutation rate), and heritability were considered. All of the phenotypes\nand genotypes were generated by AlphaSimR simulation software. Four genome selection algorithms\n(gBLUP, rrBLUP, BayesA, and BayesC) were tested to derive GEBV, and their accuracies\n(area under the curve, AUC) were compared.\n\n\n\nIn different scenarios, the AUC ranges from 0.4237 to 0.6895 for BayesA, 0.4282 to\n0.6878 for BayesC, 0.4278 to 0.6798 for gBLUP, and 0.4346 to 0.6834 for rrBLUP. The mean AUC\nof these four algorithms was not significantly different (0.547\u20130.548). The accuracies of the four\ngenome selection algorithms were similar but had different predictive performances in specific scenarios.\nThe gBLUP was most stable, and the rrBLUP was slightly better at predicting low heritability\ntraits. When the number of individuals was small, the BayesA and BayesC algorithms were more\nrobust.\n\n\n\nA practical GS scheme should be optimized in accordance with marker density, heritability,\nand reference population size. Adequate preliminary research is necessary. The results provide\na framework for the design of genomic selection schemes in E. coioides breeding.\n",

        "title": "When Machine Unlearning Jeopardizes Privacy",
        "abstract": "The right to be forgotten states that a data owner has the right to erase their data from an entity storing it. In the context of machine learning (ML), the right to be forgotten requires an ML model owner to remove the data owner's data from the training set used to build the ML model, a process known asmachine unlearning. While originally designed to protect the privacy of the data owner, we argue that machine unlearning may leave some imprint of the data in the ML model and thus create unintended privacy risks. In this paper, we perform the first study on investigating the unintended information leakage caused by machine unlearning. We propose a novel membership inference attack that leverages the different outputs of an ML model's two versions to infer whether a target sample is part of the training set of the original model but out of the training set of the corresponding unlearned model. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed membership inference attack achieves strong performance. More importantly, we show that our attack in multiple cases outperforms the classical membership inference attack on the original ML model, which indicates that machine unlearning can have counterproductive effects on privacy. We notice that the privacy degradation is especially significant for well-generalized ML models where classical membership inference does not perform well. We further investigate four mechanisms to mitigate the newly discovered privacy risks and show that releasing the predicted label only, temperature scaling, and differential privacy are effective. We believe that our results can help improve privacy protection in practical implementations of machine unlearning. \\footnoteOur code is available at \\urlhttps://github.com/MinChen00/UnlearningLeaks.",

        "title": "Asynchronous Distributed Key Generation for Computationally-Secure Randomness, Consensus, and Threshold Signatures.",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we present the first Asynchronous Distributed Key Generation (ADKG) algorithm which is also the first distributed key generation algorithm that can generate cryptographic keys with a dual (f,2f+1)-threshold (where f is the number of faulty parties). As a result, using our ADKG we remove the trusted setup assumption that the most scalable consensus algorithms make. In order to create a DKG with a dual (f,2f+1)- threshold we first answer in the affirmative the open question posed by Cachin et al. [7] on how to create an Asynchronous Verifiable Secret Sharing (AVSS) protocol with a reconstruction threshold of f+1<k \u0142e 2f+1, which is of independent interest. Our High-threshold-AVSS (HAVSS) uses an asymmetric bivariate polynomial to encode the secret. This enables the reconstruction of the secret only if a set of k nodes contribute while allowing an honest node that did not participate in the sharing phase to recover his share with the help of f+1 honest parties. Once we have HAVSS we can use it to bootstrap scalable partially synchronous consensus protocols, but the question on how to get a DKG in asynchrony remains as we need a way to produce common randomness. The solution comes from a novelEventually Perfect Common Coin (EPCC) abstraction that enables the generation of a common coin from n concurrent HAVSS invocations. EPCC's key property is that it is eventually reliable, as it might fail to agree at most f times (even if invoked a polynomial number of times). UsingEPCC we implement anEventually Efficient Asynchronous Binary Agreement (EEABA) which is optimal when the EPCC agrees and protects safety when EPCC fails. Finally, using EEABA we construct the first ADKG which has the same overhead and expected runtime as the best partially-synchronous DKG (O(n4) words, O(f) rounds). As a corollary of our ADKG, we can also create the first Validated Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement (VABA) that does not need a trusted dealer to setup threshold signatures of degree n-f. Our VABA has an overhead of expected O(n2) words and O(1) time per instance, after an initial O(n4) words and O(f) time bootstrap via ADKG.",

        "title": "PMForce: Systematically Analyzing postMessage Handlers at Scale",
        "abstract": "The Web has become a platform in which sites rely on intricate interactions that span across the boundaries of origins. While the Same-Origin Policy prevents direct data exchange with documents from other origins, the postMessage API offers one relaxation that allows developers to exchange data across these boundaries. While prior manual analysis could show the presence of issues within postMessage handlers, unfortunately, a steep increase in postMessage usage makes any manual approach intractable. To deal with this increased work load, we set out to automatically find issues in postMessage handlers that allow an attacker to execute code in the vulnerable sites, alter client-side state, or leak sensitive information. To achieve this goal, we present an automated analysis framework running inside the browser, which uses selective forced execution paired with lightweight dynamic taint tracking to find traces in the analyzed handlers that end in sinks allowing for code-execution or state alterations. We use path constraints extracted from the program traces and augment them with Exploit Templates, i.e., additional constraints, ascertaining that a valid assignment that solves all these constraints produces a code-invoking or state-manipulating behavior. Based on these constraints, we use Z3 to generate postMessages aimed at triggering the insecure functionality to prove exploitability, and validate our findings at scale. We use this framework to conduct the most comprehensive experiment studying the security issues of postMessage handlers found throughout the top 100,000 most influential sites yet, which allows us to find potentially exploitable data flows in 252 unique handlers out of which 111 were automatically exploitable.",

        "title": "TSS: Transformation-Specific Smoothing for Robustness Certification",
        "abstract": "As machine learning (ML) systems become pervasive, safeguarding their security is critical. However, recently it has been demonstrated that motivated adversaries are able to mislead ML systems by perturbing test data using semantic transformations. While there exists a rich body of research providing provable robustness guarantees for ML models against Lp bounded adversarial perturbations, guarantees against semantic perturbations remain largely underexplored. In this paper, we provide TSS-a unified framework for certifying ML robustness against general adversarial semantic transformations. First, depending on the properties of each transformation, we divide common transformations into two categories, namely resolvable (e.g., Gaussian blur) and differentially resolvable (e.g., rotation) transformations. For the former, we propose transformation-specific randomized smoothing strategies and obtain strong robustness certification. The latter category covers transformations that involve interpolation errors, and we propose a novel approach based on stratified sampling to certify the robustness. Our framework TSS leverages these certification strategies and combines with consistency-enhanced training to provide rigorous certification of robustness. We conduct extensive experiments on over ten types of challenging semantic transformations and show that TSS significantly outperforms the state of the art. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, TSS is the first approach that achieves nontrivial certified robustness on the large-scale ImageNet dataset. For instance, our framework achieves 30.4% certified robust accuracy against rotation attack (within \u00b130\u00b0) on ImageNet. Moreover, to consider a broader range of transformations, we show TSS is also robust against adaptive attacks and unforeseen image corruptions such as CIFAR-10-C and ImageNet-C.",

        "title": "Exaggerated Error Handling Hurts! An In-Depth Study and Context-Aware Detection",
        "abstract": "Operating system (OS) kernels frequently encounter various errors due to invalid internal states or external inputs. To ensure the security and reliability of OS kernels, developers propose a diverse set of mechanisms to conservatively capture and handle potential errors. Existing research has thus primarily focused on the completeness and adequacy of error handling to not miss the attention. However, we find that handling an error with an over-severe level (e.g., unnecessarily terminating the execution) instead hurts the security and reliability. In this case, the error-handling consequences are even worse than the error it attempts to resolve. We call such a case Exaggerated Error Handling (EEH). The security impacts of EEH bugs vary, including denial-of-service, data losses, broken control-flow integrity, memory leaks, etc. Despite its significance, detecting EEH remains an unexplored topic. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth study on EEH. Based on the findings of the study, we then propose an approach, EeCatch, to detect EEH bugs in a context-aware manner. EeCatch accurately identifies errors and extracts their contexts (both spatial and temporal), and automatically infers the appropriate severity level for error handling. Using the inferred severity level, EeCatch finally detects EEH bugs in which the used error handling exceeds the inferred severity level. By analyzing the whole Linux kernel, EeCatch reports hundreds of potential EEH bugs that may cause security issues such as crashing the system. After evaluating 104 cases reported by EeCatch, we manually confirmed 64 EEH bugs and submitted patches for all of them. Using our patches, Linux maintainers have fixed 48 reported EEH bugs, confirming the effectiveness of EeCatch. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to systematically study and detect EEH bugs. We hope the findings could raise the awareness of the critical consequences of EEH bugs to help developers avoid them.",

The biggest challenge to build this tool was to make most of the functions, modules, libraries and even workflow schemes (nearly) compatible between frameworks and to make a multipurpose single Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Big Data availlable in the desktop and on the cloud. The development of the HGrid library starts with the collection of functions needed, how they can be implemented in each framework and how the codes can be generated. HGrid generated codes were also benchmarked against some commercially availlable tools to ensure good performance. HGrid is also designed to be visual, robust and user friendly although it still need to be improved in user experience part. It is also designed for average programmers and analysts. Data engineering libraries has been continuosly developed to ease application development with target near zero programming at the programmers side. HGrid has been used largely at the telco operators in Indonesia, in the largest banks, government institutions, hospitals and military to build complex applications such as Data Lake, Mediation Device, Media Analytics and many others.",

        "abstract": "App-in-app is a new and trending mobile computing paradigm in which native app-like software modules, called sub-apps, are hosted by popular mobile apps such as Wechat, Baidu, TikTok and Chrome, to enrich the host app's functionalities and to form an \"all-in-one app\" ecosystem. Sub-apps access system resources through the host, and their functionalities come close to regular mobile apps (taking photos, recording voices, banking, shopping, etc.). Less clear, however, is whether the host app, typically a third-party app, is capable of securely managing sub-apps and their access to system resources. In this paper, we report the first systematic study on the resource management in app-in-app systems. Our study reveals high-impact security flaws, which allow the adversary to stealthily escalate privilege (e.g., accessing the camera, photo gallery, microphone, etc.) or acquire sensitive data (e.g., location, passwords of Amazon, Google, etc.). To understand the impacts of those flaws, we developed an analysis tool that automatically assesses 11 popular app-in-app platforms on both Android and iOS. Our results brought to light the prevalence of the security flaws. We further discuss the lessons learned and propose mitigation strategies.",

Many companies choose to follow the regulation by purchasing green energy. To purchase the energy effectively, it is necessary to understand its own electricity consumption. In this paper, electricity load forecasting models are studied and compared. The impact of the holiday adjustment policy of Taiwan on the forecasting is investigated. Experimental results demonstrated that the recent, deep-learning technique LSTM achieved the best performance. On the 9-month test data, MAPE of the LSTM was 1.85%.",

        "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) has emerged as a de facto standard privacy notion for a wide range of applications. Since the meaning of data utility in different applications may vastly differ, a key challenge is to find the optimal randomization mechanism, i.e., the distribution and its parameters, for a given utility metric. Existing works have identified the optimal distributions in some special cases, while leaving all other utility metrics (e.g., usefulness and graph distance) as open problems. Since existing works mostly rely on manual analysis to examine the search space of all distributions, it would be an expensive process to repeat such efforts for each utility metric. To address such deficiency, we propose a novel approach that can automatically optimize different utility metrics found in diverse applications under a common framework. Our key idea that, by regarding the variance of the injected noise itself as a random variable, a two-fold distribution may approximately cover the search space of all distributions. Therefore, we can automatically find distributions in this search space to optimize different utility metrics in a similar manner, simply by optimizing the parameters of the two-fold distribution. Specifically, we define a universal framework, namely, randomizing the randomization mechanism of differential privacy (R2DP), and we formally analyze its privacy and utility. Our experiments show that R2DP can provide better results than the baseline distribution (Laplace) for several utility metrics with no known optimal distributions, whereas our results asymptotically approach to the optimality for utility metrics having known optimal distributions. As a side benefit, the added degree of freedom introduced by the two-fold distribution allows R2DP to accommodate the preferences of both data owners and recipients.",

        "title": "Fill in the Blanks: Empirical Analysis of the Privacy Threats of Browser Form Autofill",
        "abstract": "Providing functionality that streamlines the more tedious aspects of website interaction is of paramount importance to browsers as it can significantly improve the overall user experience. Browsers' autofill functionality exemplifies this goal, as it alleviates the burden of repetitively typing the same information across websites. At the same time, however, it also presents a significant privacy risk due to the inherent disparity between the browser's interpretation of a given web page and what users can visually perceive. In this paper we present the first, to our knowledge, comprehensive exploration of the privacy threats of autofill functionality. We first develop a series of new techniques for concealing the presence of form elements that allow us to obtain sensitive user information while bypassing existing browser defenses. Alarmingly, our large-scale study in the Alexa top 100K reveals the widespread use of such deceptive techniques for stealthily obtaining user-identifying information, as they are present in at least 5.8% of the forms that are autofilled by Chrome. Subsequently, our in-depth investigation of browsers' autofill functionality reveals a series of flaws and idiosyncrasies, which we exploit through a series of novel attack vectors that target specific aspects of browsers' behavior. By chaining these together we are able to demonstrate a novel invasive side-channel attack that exploits browser's autofill preview functionality for inferring sensitive information even when users choose to not utilize autofill. This attack affects all major Chromium-based browsers and allows attackers to probe users' autofill profiles for over a hundred thousand candidate values (e.g., credit card and phone numbers). Overall, while the preview mode is intended as a protective measure for enabling more informed decisions, ultimately it creates a new avenue of exposure that circumvents a user's choice to not divulge their information. In light of our findings, we have disclosed our techniques to the affected vendors, and have also created a Chrome extension that can prevent our attacks and mitigate this threat until our countermeasures are incorporated into browsers.",

Although web search engines have shown lots of advantages for us to search on the internet, its basic usage is remaining in only entering a few keywords. Its simplicity enables many people to use it easily, however, combining keywords needs well-experienced ability, therefore, it cannot be applied to another usage such as searching trends. CSE has been established to deal with temporal data, especially, trends among contents. However, it does not support combined queries like that of using boolean operations. This paper proposes to introduce boolean operations into CSE, and shows its advantages through experiments conducted with help of participants of students.",

        "title": "Deploying Android Security Updates: an Extensive Study Involving Manufacturers, Carriers, and End Users",
        "abstract": "Android's fragmented ecosystem makes the delivery of security updates and OS upgrades cumbersome and complex. While Google initiated various projects such as Android One, Project Treble, and Project Mainline to address this problem, and other involved entities (e.g., chipset vendors, manufacturers, carriers) continuously strive to improve their processes, it is still unclear how effective these efforts are on the delivery of updates to supported end-user devices. In this paper, we perform an extensive quantitative study (Aug. 2015 to Dec. 2019) to measure the Android security updates and OS upgrades rollout process. Our study leverages multiple data sources: the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), device manufacturers, and the top four U.S. carriers (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint). Furthermore, we analyze an end-user dataset captured in 2019 (152M anonymized HTTP requests associated with 9.1M unique user identifiers) from a U.S.-based social network. Our findings include unique measurements that, due to the fragmented and inconsistent ecosystem, were previously challenging to perform. For example, manufacturers and carriers introduce a median latency of 24 days before rolling out security updates, with an additional median delay of 11 days before end devices update. We show that these values alter per carrier-manufacturer relationship, yet do not alter greatly based on a model's age. Our results also delve into the effectiveness of current Android projects. For instance, security updates for Treble devices are available on average 7 days faster than for non-Treble devices. While this constitutes an improvement, the security update delay for Treble devices still averages 19 days.",

        "title": "A Personalised Blood Pressure Prediction System using Gaussian Mixture Regression and Online Recurrent Extreme Learning Machine",
        "abstract": "Hypertension is an epidemic restricted not only to the developing but also to the developed nations. It is triggered by various lifestyle choices that depend on each individual based on their personal physiology and lifestyle. Early diagnosis is possible, but it requires continuous blood pressure monitoring. Various machine learning methods have been proposed for early diagnosis of hypertension by predicting blood pressure and detecting high spikes in the values. However, these solutions are built upon the generic guidelines which may not be applicable for every patient. Most of these solutions incorporate batch learning and require all data to be present before prediction and do not support any online learning mechanism. This leads to potentially outdated models. Furthermore, there is also a lack of an intelligent approach to handling incomplete time series while training the model. This paper presents a personalized approach to estimate blood pressure that eliminates the need for continuous monitoring based on the Online recurrent extreme learning machine (OR-ELM). The missing values are imputed using Gaussian mixture models. The prediction model learns from the historical data and learns online as more data becomes available. The proposed scheme is developed and deployed on a mobile application for secured prediction results. The method is used to predict blood pressure in Malaysian population and compared with existing batch-learning and online learning methods. The results show that OR-ELM based model outperforms the existing online techniques such as the Online sequential extreme learning machine and batch learning technique such as Extreme learning machine.",

In color psychology, colors in surroundings can affect human emotional states and behavioral responses. In educational field, the effect on students\u2019 emotions and performance in class has been discussed. The design of an environment through a variety of means such as lighting and colors can stimulate perceptual and emotional responses in students and affect their behavior. However, they did not discuss the methodology for quantitatively assessing student\u2019s internal state. We therefore developed a multimodal sensing for understanding color effect on students\u2019 task performance.",

To realize their safe movement, researchers extract pedestrian features from images without considering pedestrian characteristics. However, before these extractions, it is also important to estimate which person should be paid attention and assigning priority order by the degree of danger for PMV\u2019s collision avoidance.

        "abstract": "FingerVision is becoming a promising solution to tactile manipulation tasks. This paper introduces a modular custom FingerVision and a new method of specific contact surface recognition implementing KNN (k-Nearest Neighbor) algorithm. This method uses the markers array in the sensor as feature points to describe the deformation in contact, and generates a database recording all simulated conditions to identify surfaces of different shapes. Adjusted parameters of the blob detection algorithm and a frame correction algorithm by linear interpolation in the feature extraction process are proposed as well. Recognition effects of different sample sizes, k values and other factors are discussed with an accuracy test. With optimization, accuracy rate of recognition achieves 100% among 570 test samples with 1140 given samples from 7 surfaces in 19 categories. The conclusions are that the accuracy of this method hardly depends on the k value and the dimension of coordinates analyzed, so the default k value 5 and only abscissas are applied to simplify the calculation. As for sample size, when the given sample number of each category reaches about 40, the accuracy rate is almost 100%, and thus it is unnecessary to continue to increase the sample size.",

        "title": "VAHunt: Warding Off New Repackaged Android Malware in App-Virtualization's Clothing",
        "abstract": "Repackaging popular benign apps with malicious payload used to be the most common way to spread Android malware. Nevertheless, since 2016, we have observed an alarming new trend to Android ecosystem: a growing number of Android malware samples abuse recent app-virtualization innovation as a new distribution channel. App-virtualization enables a user to run multiple copies of the same app on a single device, and tens of millions of users are enjoying this convenience. However, cybercriminals repackage various malicious APK files as plugins into an app-virtualization platform, which is flexible to launch arbitrary plugins without the hassle of installation. This new style of repackaging gains the ability to bypass anti-malware scanners by hiding the grafted malicious payload in plugins, and it also defies the basic premise embodied by existing repackaged app detection solutions. As app-virtualization-based apps are not necessarily malware, in this paper, we aim to make a verdict on them prior to run time. Our in-depth study results in two key observations: 1) the proxy layer between plugin apps and the Android framework is the core of app-virtualization mechanism, and it reveals the feature of finite state transitions; 2) malware typically loads plugins stealthily and hides malicious behaviors. These insights motivate us to develop a two-layer detection approach, called VAHunt. First, we design a stateful detection model to identify the existence of an app-virtualization engine in APK files. Second, we perform data flow analysis to extract fingerprinting features to differentiate between malicious and benign loading strategies. Since October 2019, we have tested VAHunt in Antiy AVL Mobile Security, a leading mobile security company, to detect more than 139K app-virtualization-based samples. Compared with the ground truth, VAHunt achieves 0.7% false negatives and zero false positive. Our automated detection frees security analysts from the burden of reverse engineering.",

        "title": "On the TOCTOU Problem in Remote Attestation",
        "abstract": "Much attention has been devoted to verifying software integrity of remote embedded (IoT) devices. Many techniques, with different assumptions and security guarantees, have been proposed under the common umbrella of so-called Remote Attestation (RA). Aside from executable's integrity verification, RA serves as a foundation for many security services, such as proofs of memory erasure, system reset, software update, and verification of runtime properties. Prior RA techniques verify the remote device's binary at the time when RA functionality is executed, thus providing no information about the device's binary before current RA execution or between consecutive RA executions. This implies that presence of transient malware (in the form of modified binary) may be undetected. In other words, if transient malware infects a device (by modifying its binary), performs its nefarious tasks, and erases itself before the next attestation, its temporary presence will not be detected. This important problem, called Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use ( TOCTOU ), is well-known in the research literature and remains unaddressed in the context of hybrid RA. In this work, we propose Remote Attestation with TOCTOU Avoidance (RATA): a provably secure approach to address the RA TOCTOU problem. With RATA, even malware that erases itself before execution of the next RA, can not hide its ephemeral presence. RATA targets hybrid RA architectures, which are aimed at low-end embedded devices. We present two alternative techniques - RATA A and RATA B - suitable for devices with and without real-time clocks, respectively. Each is shown to be secure and accompanied by a publicly available and formally verified implementation. Our evaluation demonstrates low hardware overhead of both techniques. Compared with current hybrid RA architectures - that offer no TOCTOU protection - RATA incurs no extra runtime overhead. In fact, it substantially reduces the time complexity of RA computations: from linear to constant time.",

        "abstract": "We use biometrics like fingerprints and facial images to identify ourselves to our mobile devices and log on to applications everyday. Such authentication is internal-facing: we provide measurement on the same device where the template is stored. If our personal devices could participate in external-facing authentication too, where biometric measurement is captured by a nearby external sensor, then we could also enjoy a frictionless authentication experience in a variety of physical spaces like grocery stores, convention centers, ATMs, etc. The open setting of a physical space brings forth important privacy concerns though. We design a suite of secure protocols for external-facing authentication based on the cosine similarity metric which provide privacy for both user templates stored on their devices and the biometric measurement captured by external sensors in this open setting. The protocols provide different levels of security, ranging from passive security with some leakage to active security with no leakage at all. With the help of new packing techniques and zero-knowledge proofs for Paillier encryption -- and careful protocol design, our protocols achieve very practical performance numbers. For templates of length 256 with elements of size 16 bits each, our fastest protocol takes merely 0.024 seconds to compute a match, but even the slowest one takes no more than 0.12 seconds. The communication overhead of our protocols is very small too. The passive and actively secure protocols (with some leakage) need to exchange just 16.5KB and 27.8KB of data, respectively. The first message is designed to be reusable and, if sent in advance, would cut the overhead down to just 0.5KB and 0.8KB, respectively.",

        "title": "Mitigation of Attacks on Email End-to-End Encryption",
        "abstract": "OpenPGP and S/MIME are two major standards for securing email communication introduced in the early 1990s. Three recent classes of attacks exploit weak cipher modes (EFAIL Malleability Gadgets, or EFAIL-MG), the flexibility of the MIME email structure (EFAIL Direct Exfiltration, or EFAIL-DE), and the Reply action of the email client (REPLY attacks). Although all three break message confidentiality by using standardized email features, only EFAIL-MG has been mitigated in IETF standards with the introduction of AEAD algorithms. So far, no uniform and reliable countermeasures have been adopted by email clients to prevent EFAIL-DE and REPLY attacks. Instead, email clients implement a variety of different ad-hoc countermeasures which are only partially effective, cause interoperability problems, and fragment the secure email ecosystem. We present the first generic countermeasure against both REPLY and EFAIL-DE attacks by checking the decryption context including SMTP headers and MIME structure during decryption. The decryption context is encoded into a string DC and used as Associated Data (AD) in the AEAD encryption. Thus the proposed solution seamlessly extends the EFAIL-MG countermeasures. The decryption context changes whenever an attacker alters the email source code in a critical way, for example, if the attacker changes the MIME structure or adds a new Reply-To header. The proposed solution does not cause any interoperability problems and legacy emails can still be decrypted. We evaluate our approach by implementing the decryption contexts in Thunderbird/Enigmail and by verifying their correct functionality after the email has been transported over all major email providers, including Gmail and iCloud Mail.",

        "title": "Estimating g-Leakage via Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of estimating the information leakage of a system in the black-box scenario, i.e. when the system's internals are unknown to the learner, or too complicated to analyze, and the only available information are pairs of input-output data samples, obtained by submitting queries to the system or provided by a third party. The frequentist approach relies on counting the frequencies to estimate the input-output conditional probabilities, however this method is not accurate when the domain of possible outputs is large. To overcome this difficulty, the estimation of the Bayes error of the ideal classifier was recently investigated using Machine Learning (ML) models, and it has been shown to be more accurate thanks to the ability of those models to learn the input-output correspondence. However, the Bayes vulnerability is only suitable to describe one-try attacks. A more general and flexible measure of leakage is the g-vulnerability, which encompasses several different types of adversaries, with different goals and capabilities. We propose a novel approach to perform black-box estimation of the g-vulnerability using ML which does not require to estimate the conditional probabilities and is suitable for a large class of ML algorithms. First, we formally show the learnability for all data distributions. Then, we evaluate the performance via various experiments using k-Nearest Neighbors and Neural Networks. Our approach outperform the frequentist one when the observables domain is large.",

Despite much research, there is little definitive, scientific guidance on how these mechanisms should be combined and configured to best effect. Through two online experiments, we evaluated combinations of minimum-length and character-class requirements, blocklists, and a minimum-strength requirement that requires passwords to exceed a strength threshold according to neural-network-driven password-strength estimates. Our results lead to concrete recommendations for policy configurations that produce a good balance of security and usability. In particular, for high-value user accounts we recommend policies that combine minimum-strength and minimum-length requirements. While we offer recommendations for organizations required to use blocklists, using blocklists does not provide further gains. Interestingly, we also find that against expert attackers, character-class requirements, traditionally associated with producing stronger passwords, in practice may provide very little improvement and may even reduce effective security.",

        "title": "Security Analysis and Implementation of Relay-Resistant Contactless Payments",
        "abstract": "Contactless systems, such as the EMV (Europay, Mastercard and Visa) payment protocol, are vulnerable to relay attacks. The typical countermeasure to this relies on distance bounding protocols, in which a reader estimates an upper bound on its physical distance from a card by doing round-trip time (RTT) measurements. However, these protocols are trivially broken in the presence of rogue readers. At Financial Crypto 2019, we proposed two novel EMV-based relay-resistant protocols: they integrate distance-bounding with the use of hardware roots of trust (HWRoT) in such a way that correct RTT-measurements can no longer be bypassed. Our contributions are threefold: first, we design a calculus to model this advanced type of distance-bounding protocols integrated with HWRoT; as an additional novelty, our calculus is also the first to allow for mobility of cards and readers during a proximity-checking phase. Second, to make it possible to analyse these protocols via more standard mechanisms and tools, we consider a 2018 characterisation of distance-bounding security that does away with physical aspects and relies only on the causality of events; we cast it in our richer calculus and extend its theoretical guarantees to our more expressive models (with mobility, potentially rogue readers, and HWRoT). Due to this extension, we can carry out the security analysis in the standard protocol verification tool ProVerif. Third, we provide the first implementation of Mastercard's relay-resistant EMV protocol PayPass-RRP as well as one of its 2019 extension with HWRoT called PayBCR. We evaluate their efficiency and their robustness to relay attacks, in presence of both honest and rogue readers. Our experiments are the first to show that Mastercard's PayPass-RRP and its HWRoT-based extension PayBCR are both practical in preventing relay attacks of the magnitude shown thus-far in EMV.",

        "abstract": "Software patching is one of the most significant mechanisms to combat vulnerabilities. To demystify underlying patch details, the techniques of patch differential analysis (a.k.a. patch diffing) are proposed to find differences between patched and unpatched programs' binary code. Considering the sophisticated security patches, patch diffing is expected to not only correctly locate patch changes but also provide sufficient explanation for understanding patch details and the fixed vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, none of the existing patch diffing techniques can meet these requirements. In this study, we first perform a large-scale study on code changes of security patches for better understanding their patterns. We then point out several challenges and design principles for patch diffing. To address the above challenges, we design a dynamic patch diffing technique PatchScope. Our technique is motivated by two key observations: 1) the way that a program processes its input reveals a wealth of semantic information, and 2) most memory corruption patches regulate the handling of malformed inputs via updating the manipulations of input-related data structures. The core of PatchScope is a new semantics-aware program representation, memory object access sequence, which characterizes how a program references data structures to manipulate inputs. The representation can not only deliver succinct patch differences but also offer rich patch context information such as input-patch correlations. Such information can interpret patch differences and further help security analysts understand patch details, locate vulnerability root causes, and even detect buggy patches.",

        "title": "eThor: Practical and Provably Sound Static Analysis of Ethereum Smart Contracts",
        "abstract": "Ethereum has emerged as the most popular smart contract platform, with hundreds of thousands of contracts stored on the blockchain and covering diverse application scenarios, such as auctions, trading platforms, or elections. Given the financial nature of smart contracts, security vulnerabilities may lead to catastrophic consequences and, even worse, can hardly be fixed as data stored on the blockchain, including the smart contract code itself, are immutable. An automated security analysis of these contracts is thus of utmost interest, but at the same time technically challenging. This is as e.g., Ethereum's transaction-oriented programming mechanisms feature a subtle semantics, and since the blockchain data at execution time, including the code of callers and callees, are not statically known. In this work, we present eThor, the first sound and automated static analyzer for EVM bytecode, which is based on an abstraction of the EVM bytecode semantics based on Horn clauses. In particular, our static analysis supports reachability properties, which we show to be sufficient for capturing interesting security properties for smart contracts (e.g., single-entrancy) as well as contract-specific functional properties. Our analysis is proven sound against a complete semantics of EVM bytecode, and a large-scale experimental evaluation on real-world contracts demonstrates that eThor is practical and outperforms the state-of-the-art static analyzers: specifically, eThor is the only one to provide soundness guarantees, terminates on 94% of a representative set of real-world contracts, and achieves an F-measure (which combines sensitivity and specificity) of 89%.",

        "abstract": "Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols allow a group of replicas to come to consensus even when some of the replicas are Byzantine faulty. There exist multiple BFT protocols to securely tolerate an optimal number of faults t under different network settings. However, if the number of faults f exceeds t then security could be violated. In this paper we mathematically formalize the study of forensic support of BFT protocols: we aim to identify (with cryptographic integrity) as many of the malicious replicas as possible and in as distributed manner as possible. Our main result is that forensic support of BFT protocols depends heavily on minor implementation details that do not affect the protocol's security or complexity. Focusing on popular BFT protocols (PBFT, HotStuff, Algorand) we exactly characterize their forensic support, showing that there exist minor variants of each protocol for which the forensic supports vary widely. We show strong forensic support capability of LibraBFT, the consensus protocol of Diem cryptocurrency; our lightweight forensic module implemented on a Diem client is open-sourced and is under active consideration for deployment in Diem. Finally, we show that all secure BFT protocols designed for 2t+1 replicas communicating over a synchronous network forensic support is inherently nonexistent; this impossibility result holds for all BFT protocols and even if one has access to the states of all replicas (including Byzantine ones).",

For the recognition of human motions in the process of human-computer collaboration, existing algorithms are usually difficult to meet the requirements of real-time processing and easily interfered by lighting or image noises. In this paper, a method for establishing a static background model based on pixel histogram is proposed. The effect of moving targets and noises on the background model is excluded due to the selectivity of the new algorithm to the gray values, so it can detect the real background more reliably. Compared with other moving target detection methods, this method has the characteristics of fast speed, strong anti-interference ability, and the ability to identify human body movement quickly and accurately.",

        "abstract": "Secure search looks for and retrieves records from a (possibly cloud-hosted) encrypted database while ensuring the confidentiality of the queries. Researchers are paying increasing attention to secure search in recent years due to the growing concerns about database privacy. However, the low efficiency of (especially multiplicative) homomorphic operations in secure search has hindered its deployment in practice. To address this issue, Akavia et al. [CCS 2018, PETS 2019] proposed new protocols that bring down the number of multiplications in the search algorithm from O(n2) to O(n log2 n), and then to O(n log n), where n is the size of the database. In this paper, we present the first secure search protocol -- LEAF and its variant LEAF+ -- which only requires $O(n)$ multiplications. Specifically, at the core of LEAF are three novel methods we propose, referred to as Localization, Extraction, and Reconstruction. In addition, LEAF enjoys low communication complexity and only requires the client to perform decryption, which adds its advantage in deployment on weak-power devices such as mobile phones.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) classifiers have been widely deployed to detect Android malware, but at the same time the application of ML classifiers also faces an emerging problem. The performance of such classifiers degrades---or called ages---significantly over time given the malware evolution. Prior works have proposed to use retraining or active learning to reverse and improve aged models. However, the underlying classifier itself is still blind, unaware of malware evolution. Unsurprisingly, such evolution-insensitive retraining or active learning comes at a price, i.e., the labeling of tens of thousands of malware samples and the cost of significant human efforts. In this paper, we propose the first framework, called APIGraph, to enhance state-of-the-art malware classifiers with the similarity information among evolved Android malware in terms of semantically-equivalent or similar API usages, thus naturally slowing down classifier aging. Our evaluation shows that because of the slow-down of classifier aging, APIGraph saves significant amounts of human efforts required by active learning in labeling new malware samples.",

        "title": "Composite Backdoor Attack for Deep Neural Network by Mixing Existing Benign Features",
        "abstract": "With the prevalent use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in many applications, security of these networks is of importance. Pre-trained DNNs may contain backdoors that are injected through poisoned training. These trojaned models perform well when regular inputs are provided, but misclassify to a target output label when the input is stamped with a unique pattern called trojan trigger. Recently various backdoor detection and mitigation systems for DNN based AI applications have been proposed. However, many of them are limited to trojan attacks that require a specific patch trigger. In this paper, we introduce composite attack, a more flexible and stealthy trojan attack that eludes backdoor scanners using trojan triggers composed from existing benign features of multiple labels. We show that a neural network with a composed backdoor can achieve accuracy comparable to its original version on benign data and misclassifies when the composite trigger is present in the input. Our experiments on 7 different tasks show that this attack poses a severe threat. We evaluate our attack with two state-of-the-art backdoor scanners. The results show none of the injected backdoors can be detected by either scanner. We also study in details why the scanners are not effective. In the end, we discuss the essence of our attack and propose possible defense.",

Adorno y M. Horkheimer, a W. Benjamin, E. Fromm, H. Marcuse o J. Habermas, entre otros). Nos sirve asimismo para reflexionar en torno al contexto historico que atravesaron todos ellos, especialmente en el intervalo que va de la Gran Guerra al final de la Segunda Guerra Mundial y que ha sido definido por algunos historiadores como \u201cEra de las catastrofes\u201d o \u201cGuerra Civil Europea\u201d.

        "title": "RTFM! Automatic Assumption Discovery and Verification Derivation from Library Document for API Misuse Detection",
        "abstract": "To use library APIs, a developer is supposed to follow guidance and respect some constraints, which we call integration assumptions (IAs). Violations of these assumptions can have serious consequences, introducing security-critical flaws such as use-after-free, NULL-dereference, and authentication errors. Analyzing a program for compliance with IAs involves significant effort and needs to be automated. A promising direction is to automatically recover IAs from a library document using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and then verify their consistency with the ways APIs are used in a program through code analysis. However, a practical solution along this line needs to overcome several key challenges, particularly the discovery of IAs from loosely formatted documents and interpretation of their informal descriptions to identify complicated constraints (e.g., data-/control-flow relations between different APIs). In this paper, we present a new technique for automated assumption discovery and verification derivation from library documents. Our approach, called Advance, utilizes a suite of innovations to address those challenges. More specifically, we leverage the observation that IAs tend to express a strong sentiment in emphasizing the importance of a constraint, particularly those security-critical, and utilize a new sentiment analysis model to accurately recover them from loosely formatted documents. These IAs are further processed to identify hidden references to APIs and parameters, through an embedding model, to identify the information-flow relations expected to be followed. Then our approach runs frequent subtree mining to discover the grammatical units in IA sentences that tend to indicate some categories of constraints that could have security implications. These components are mapped to verification code snippets organized in line with the IA sentence's grammatical structure, and can be assembled into verification code executed through CodeQL to discover misuses inside a program. We implemented this design and evaluated it on 5 popular libraries (OpenSSL, SQLite, libpcap, libdbus and libxml2) and 39 real-world applications. Our analysis discovered 193 API misuses, including 139 flaws never reported before.",

        "title": "Devil is Virtual: Reversing Virtual Inheritance in C++ Binaries",
        "abstract": "The complexities that arise from the implementation of object-oriented concepts in C++ such as virtual dispatch and dynamic type casting have attracted the attention of attackers and defenders alike. Binary-level defenses are dependent on full and precise recovery of class inheritance tree of a given program. While current solutions focus on recovering single and multiple inheritances from the binary, they are oblivious of virtual inheritance. The conventional wisdom among binary-level defenses is that virtual inheritance is uncommon and/or support for single and multiple inheritances provides implicit support for virtual inheritance. In this paper, we show neither to be true. Specifically, (1) we present an efficient technique to detect virtual inheritance in C++ binaries and show through a study that virtual inheritance can be found in non-negligible number (more than 10% on Linux and 12.5% on Windows) of real-world C++ programs including Mysql and Libstdc++. (2) We show that failure to handle virtual inheritance introduces both false positives and false negatives in the hierarchy tree. These falses either introduce attack surface when the hierarchy recovered is used to enforce CFI policies, or make the hierarchy difficult to understand when it is needed for program understanding (e.g., during decompilation). (3) We present a solution to recover virtual inheritance from COTS binaries. We recover a maximum of 95% and 95.5% (GCC -O0) and a minimum of 77.5% and 73.8% (Clang -O2) of virtual and intermediate bases respectively in the virtual inheritance tree.",

The contextual information is essential in order to classify and understand the human activity using multi-modal sensory data. In the activity classification, the sensor2vec embedding method is able to do the pre-processing which produce the embedding layer which represents the semantic value in the high-dimensional space. The preliminary experiment based on LSTM shows that the sensor2vec performs better classification result than the one-hot inputs.",

        "title": "Threshold Password-Hardened Encryption Services",
        "abstract": "Password-hardened encryption (PHE) was introduced by Lai et al. at USENIX 2018 and immediately productized by VirgilSecurity. PHE is a password-based key derivation protocol that involves an oblivious external crypto service for key derivation. The security of PHE protects against offline brute-force attacks, even when the attacker is given the entire database. Furthermore, the crypto service neither learns the derived key nor the password. PHE supports key-rotation meaning that both the server and crypto service can update their keys without involving the user. While PHE significantly strengthens data security, it introduces a single point of failure because key-derivation always requires access to the crypto service. In this work, we address this issue and simultaneously increase security by introducing threshold password-hardened encryption. Our formalization of this primitive revealed shortcomings of the original PHE definition that we also address in this work. Following the spirit of prior works, we give a simple and efficient construction using lightweight tools only. We also implement our construction and evaluate its efficiency. Our experiments confirm the practical efficiency of our scheme and show that it is more efficient than common memory-hard functions, such as scrypt. From a practical perspective this means that threshold PHE can be used as an alternative to scrypt for password protection and key-derivation, offering better security in terms of offline brute force attacks.",

        "title": "DNS Cache Poisoning Attack Reloaded: Revolutions with Side Channels",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we report a series of flaws in the software stack that leads to a strong revival of DNS cache poisoning --- a classic attack which is mitigated in practice with simple and effective randomization-based defenses such as randomized source port. To successfully poison a DNS cache on a typical server, an off-path adversary would need to send an impractical number of $2^32 $ spoofed responses simultaneously guessing the correct source port (16-bit) and transaction ID (16-bit). Surprisingly, we discover weaknesses that allow an adversary to \"divide and conquer'' the space by guessing the source port first and then the transaction ID (leading to only $2^16 +2^16 $ spoofed responses). Even worse, we demonstrate a number of ways an adversary can extend the attack window which drastically improves the odds of success. The attack affects all layers of caches in the DNS infrastructure, such as DNS forwarder and resolver caches, and a wide range of DNS software stacks, including the most popular BIND, Unbound, and dnsmasq, running on top of Linux and potentially other operating systems. The major condition for a victim being vulnerable is that an OS and its network is configured to allow ICMP error replies. From our measurement, we find over 34% of the open resolver population on the Internet are vulnerable (and in particular 85% of the popular DNS services including Google's 8.8.8.8). Furthermore, we comprehensively validate the proposed attack with positive results against a variety of server configurations and network conditions that can affect the success of the attack, in both controlled experiments and a production DNS resolver (with authorization).",

        "title": "TEMPEST Comeback: A Realistic Audio Eavesdropping Threat on Mixed-signal SoCs",
        "abstract": "This study presents a new TEMPEST threat that an attacker can surreptitiously obtain original plain audio information from a distance by exploiting recently emerging unintentional electromagnetic (EM) radiations. As lightweight sensor-based Internet of things (IoT) services become widespread, a mixed-signal system on chip (MSoC) spontaneously integrates all components, such as digital, analog, and even power circuits, into a single chipset to minimize the size of IoT devices. Accordingly, we pay attention to the accelerated integration of a switching regulator (SWREG), which is one of the typical power circuits and may substantially increase the unintentional EM leakages, re-enabling the audio TEMPEST attack. In this paper, we posit that a root cause of new audio coupled EM leakages is the unavoidable integration of SWREG which innately has strong and low-frequency (i.e., several MHz) switching noises; an audio signal is conductively coupled on the single common substrate of an MSoC with a system clock and the newly emerging the SWREG noises. The unique features of the suggested EM leakages compared to previous leakages are that their frequency distribution is dense (i.e., at frequency intervals of the SWREG noise), wideband (i.e., from several MHz to over 1 GHz), and static (i.e., time-invariant center frequencies). These features make the new TEMPEST attack due to the SWREG noise have a longer attack range and be more robust to interferences. Consequently, the presented TEMPEST attack becomes considerably practical. To verify the new TEMPEST attack due to the SWREG noise, we first perform a feasibility analysis by measuring and analyzing the audio-conveyed EM emanations of the popular MSoCs in an anechoic chamber. Next, we demonstrate how critical and practical the threat is by capturing the leakages from the commercial devices in an office environment. Furthermore, we propose a new signal reinforcement method with the three benefits (dense, wideband, and static) of the suggested radiations: the spectral addition of phase-aligned signals. The experimental results show that the test sweep tones of the Sogou voice recorder (nRF52810 chipset) and Xiaomi earbuds (CSR8640 chipset) can be reconstructed over 10 meters. Additionally, an attack feasibility analysis on digital signal (I2C) is performed in a short-range. The overall results indicate that the new TEMPEST attack becomes more practical than the previous side-channel analysis. Finally, we suggest several technical countermeasures that help to design safe IoT devices.",

        "title": "Off-Path TCP Exploits of the Mixed IPID Assignment",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we uncover a new off-path TCP hijacking attack that can be used to terminate victim TCP connections or inject forged data into victim TCP connections by manipulating the new mixed IPID assignment method, which is widely used in Linux kernel version 4.18 and beyond to help defend against TCP hijacking attacks. The attack has three steps. First, an off-path attacker can downgrade the IPID assignment for TCP packets from the more secure per-socket-based policy to the less secure hash-based policy, building a shared IPID counter that forms a side channel on the victim. Second, the attacker detects the presence of TCP connections by observing the shared IPID counter on the victim. Third, the attacker infers the sequence number and the acknowledgment number of the detected connection by observing the side channel of the shared IPID counter. Consequently, the attacker can completely hijack the connection, i.e., resetting the connection or poisoning the data stream. We evaluate the impacts of this off-path TCP attack in the real world. Our case studies of SSH DoS, manipulating web traffic, and poisoning BGP routing tables show its threat on a wide range of applications. Our experimental results show that our off-path TCP attack can be constructed within 215 seconds and the success rate is over 88%. Finally, we analyze the root cause of the exploit and develop a new IPID assignment method to defeat this attack. We prototype our defense in Linux 4.18 and confirm its effectiveness through extensive evaluation over real applications on the Internet.",

        "title": "RIPT -- An Efficient Multi-Core Record-Replay System",
        "abstract": "Given the same input, a program may not behave the same in two runs due to some non-deterministic features, e.g., context switch and randomization. Such behaviors would cause non-deterministic program bugs which are hard to discover or diagnose. Record-and-replay is a promising technique to address such issues, however, performance and transparency are the main obstacles of existing works. In this poster, we propose a novel record-and-replay system named RIPT. RIPT utilizes Intel Processor Trace to record control flow information with very low overhead, and transparently captures non-deterministic sources such as system calls and signals with a kernel module. During replay, RIPT recovers the effect of non-deterministic events from the collected information, and makes target programs behave the same as recorded. We evaluate it with real-world program bugs and show that RIPT works well in practice.",

Parce que l\u2019image video autorise d\u2019etonnantes boucles auto-inclusives et parce qu\u2019elle favorise une ecriture in\u00a0progress comparable a celle du romancier, elle lui offrait des modeles qui auraient pu rencontrer son interet bien davantage que le modele cinematographique dont il s\u2019est toujours reclame. Cette proximite entre l\u2019ecriture de Simon et l\u2019ecriture video est d\u2019autant plus interessante a observer qu\u2019elle permet de mieux comprendre pourquoi le projet de l\u2019ecrivain de passer a la realisation cinematographique etait voue a l\u2019echec.",

        "abstract": "Among the advanced countries, especially in Japan, we are facing on the decreasing birthrate and aging population ahead of the world. In recent, population of single-living elder, and elderly people have been taking care by same-aged person, have been actualized. Unfortunately, the population of caregivers is decreasing according to year. In this situation, the Elderly Person Watching System has been focused on. Especially, Robotics, Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence technology have been having high affinity with this system. In this study, firstly, the person watching robot system will be developed. In detail, in this paper, the flexible-analyze system will be focused on. In the algorithm, a resident-tracking task and an energy-saving task are holding. The whole tasks are working based on Reinforcement Learning. Thus, the behavior algorithm of the person watching robot system will be developed. In detail, in this paper, the flexible-analyze system will be focused on. In the algorithm, a resident-tracking task and an energy-saving task are holding. From the verification experiment, the simulation results showed the proposed method has been acquired actions to switch the desired task.",

        "abstract": "Several large scale studies on the Maven, NPM, and Android ecosystems point out that many developers do not often update their vulnerable software libraries thus exposing the user of their code to security risks. The purpose of this study is to qualitatively investigate the choices and the interplay of functional and security concerns on the developers' overall decision-making strategies for selecting, managing, and updating software dependencies. We run 25 semi-structured interviews with developers of both large and small-medium enterprises located in nine countries. All interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed according to applied thematic analysis. They highlight the trade-offs that developers are facing and that security researchers must understand to provide effective support to mitigate vulnerabilities (for example bundling security fixes with functional changes might hinder adoption due to lack of resources to fix functional breaking changes). We further distill our observations to actionable implications on what algorithms and automated tools should achieve to effectively support (semi-)automatic dependency management.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate \"split-second phantom attacks,\" a scientific gap that causes two commercial advanced driver-assistance systems (ADASs), Telsa Model X (HW 2.5 and HW 3) and Mobileye 630, to treat a depthless object that appears for a few milliseconds as a real obstacle/object. We discuss the challenge that split-second phantom attacks create for ADASs. We demonstrate how attackers can apply split-second phantom attacks remotely by embedding phantom road signs into an advertisement presented on a digital billboard which causes Tesla's autopilot to suddenly stop the car in the middle of a road and Mobileye 630 to issue false notifications. We also demonstrate how attackers can use a projector in order to cause Tesla's autopilot to apply the brakes in response to a phantom of a pedestrian that was projected on the road and Mobileye 630 to issue false notifications in response to a projected road sign. To counter this threat, we propose a countermeasure which can determine whether a detected object is a phantom or real using just the camera sensor. The countermeasure (GhostBusters) uses a \"committee of experts\" approach and combines the results obtained from four lightweight deep convolutional neural networks that assess the authenticity of an object based on the object's light, context, surface, and depth. We demonstrate our countermeasure's effectiveness (it obtains a TPR of 0.994 with an FPR of zero) and test its robustness to adversarial machine learning attacks.",

        "abstract": "Divisive hierarchical clustering is a powerful tool for extracting knowledge from data with a pluralistic and appropriate information granularity. Recent developments of hierarchical clustering algorithms apply Growing Neural Gas (GNG) to data divisive mechanisms. However, GNG-based algorithms tend to generate nodes excessively and sensitive to the input order of data points. Furthermore, the plasticity-stability dilemma is another unavoidable problem. In this paper, we propose a divisive hierarchical clustering algorithm based on Adaptive Resonance Theory-based clustering. Simulation experiments show that the proposed algorithm can generate an appropriate tree structure depending on data while improving the performance of hierarchical clustering.",

        "abstract": "The development of deep learning techniques has significantly increased the ability of computers to recognize CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart), thus breaking or mitigating the security of existing captcha schemes. To protect against these attacks, recent works have been proposed to leverage adversarial machine learning to perturb captcha pictures. However, they either require the prior knowledge of captcha solving models or lack adaptivity to the evolving behaviors of attackers. Most importantly, none of them has been deployed in practical applications, and their practical applicability and effectiveness are unknown. In this work, we introduce advCAPTCHA, a practical adversarial captcha generation system that can defend against deep learning based captcha solvers, and deploy it on a large-scale online platform with near billion users. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such work that has been deployed on international large-scale online platforms. By applying adversarial learning techniques in a novel manner, advCAPTCHA can generate effective adversarial captchas to significantly reduce the success rate of attackers, which has been demonstrated by a large-scale online study. Furthermore, we also validate the feasibility of advCAPTCHA in practical applications, as well as its robustness in defending against various attacks. We leverage the existing user risk analysis system to identify potential attackers and serve advCAPTCHA to them. We then use their answers as queries to the attack model. In this manner, advCAPTCHA can be adapted/fine-tuned to accommodate the attack model evolution. Overall, advCAPTCHA can serve as a key enabler for generating robust captchas in practice and providing useful guidelines for captcha developers and practitioners.",

In order to satisfy mobility ability of intelligent robots, accurate indoor positioning is an important function.In this paper, we use the Robot Operation System(ROS) as our platform, combining with different positioning sensors and technologies, such as Light Detection and Ranging(LiDAR), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), odometer and Ultra-wideband(UWB), and fuse these data by Extended Kalman Filter(EKF) to provide accuracy positioning. Thus, we can achieve more refined Simultaneous Localization and Mapping(SLAM) which meets the intelligent robot application demand. Experiment results show that the average error distance of the mobile robot in our system can be limited in 10cm.",

        "title": "Cyber-Physical Inconsistency Vulnerability Identification for Safety Checks in Robotic Vehicles",
        "abstract": "We propose a new type of vulnerability for Robotic Vehicles (RVs), called Cyber-Physical Inconsistency. These vulnerabilities target safety checks in RVs (e.g., crash detection). They can be exploited by setting up malicious environment conditions such as placing an obstacle with a certain weight and a certain angle in the RV's trajectory. Once exploited, the safety checks may fail to report real physical accidents or report false alarms (while the RV is still operating normally). Both situations could lead to life-threatening consequences. The root cause of such vulnerabilities is that existing safety checks are mostly using simple range checks implemented in general-purpose programming languages, which are incapable of describing the complex and delicate physical world. We develop a novel technique that requires the interplay of program analysis, vehicle modeling, and search-based testing to identify such vulnerabilities. Our experiment on 4 real-world control software and 8 vehicles including quadrotors, rover, and fixed-wing airplane has discovered 10 real vulnerabilities. Our technique does not have false positives as it only reports when an exploit can be generated.",

        "abstract": "The first thing to do by the search-and-rescue (SAR) team after the disaster occurred is to find the location of the victim quickly. Thus the loss of lives can be reduced. After the disaster, the environment usually very messy, containing debris from building, soil, and gravel, which makes it harder to find the victims. By detecting the temperature using a thermal camera, it can easily be distinguished between the victims and the other background. Previous work, the technology to detect a person using a thermal camera from aerial has been developed, but it is only working with the most nearly uniform background. In this paper, we developed an automatic aerial (drones) victim detection using a thermal camera. A low-cost thermal camera has been used so that anyone can quickly implement in the real situation. By combining CNN as its algorithm that widely uses for its excellent performance on object detection, it can easily detect victims from the low-cost thermal camera and distinguished from complex background. Experiments show very well that the proposed method able to detect victims from aerial thermal view with accuracy AP = 82.49%. We believe it could bring benefits for future work with the related field and able to help search-and-rescue team to find and evacuate the victims quickly.",

        "title": "Towards Using Source Code Repositories to Identify Software Supply Chain Attacks",
        "abstract": "Increasing popularity of third-party package repositories, like NPM, PyPI, or RubyGems, makes them an attractive target for software supply chain attacks. By injecting malicious code into legitimate packages, attackers were known to gain more than 100,000 downloads of compromised packages. Current approaches for identifying malicious payloads are resource demanding. Therefore, they might not be applicable for the on-the-fly detection of suspicious artifacts being uploaded to the package repository. In this respect, we propose to use source code repositories (e.g., those in Github) for detecting injections into the distributed artifacts of a package. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach captures known attacks when malicious code was injected into PyPI packages. The analysis of the 2666 software artifacts (from all versions of the top ten most downloaded Python packages in PyPI) suggests that the technique is suitable for lightweight analysis of real-world packages.",

        "title": "The Cookie Hunter: Automated Black-box Auditing for Web Authentication and Authorization Flaws",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on authentication and authorization flaws in web apps that enable partial or full access to user accounts. Specifically, we develop a novel fully automated black-box auditing framework that analyzes web apps by exploring their susceptibility to various cookie-hijacking attacks while also assessing their deployment of pertinent security mechanisms (e.g., HSTS). Our modular framework is driven by a custom browser automation tool developed to transparently offer fault-tolerance during extended interactions with web apps. We use our framework to conduct the first automated large-scale study of cookie-based account hijacking in the wild. As our framework handles every step of the auditing process in a completely automated manner, including the challenging process of account creation, we are able to fully audit 25K domains. Our framework detects more than 10K domains that expose authentication cookies over unencrypted connections, and over 5K domains that do not protect authentication cookies from JavaScript access while also embedding third party scripts that execute in the first party's origin. Our system also automatically identifies the privacy loss caused by exposed cookies and detects 9,324 domains where sensitive user data can be accessed by attackers (e.g., address, phone number, password). Overall, our study demonstrates that cookie-hijacking is a severe and prevalent threat, as deployment of even basic countermeasures (e.g., cookie security flags) is absent or incomplete, while developers struggle to correctly deploy more demanding mechanisms.",

Nevertheless, researchers continue to find and exploit the same vulnerabilities in old and new products, highlighting a big issue among vendors: effectively tracking and fixing security vulnerabilities when disclosure is not done directly to them. In this work, we present another instance of this issue by performing the first library-wide SCA security evaluation of Mozilla's NSS security library. We use a combination of two independently-developed SCA security frameworks to identify and test security vulnerabilities. Our evaluation uncovers several new vulnerabilities in NSS affecting DSA, ECDSA, and RSA cryptosystems. We exploit said vulnerabilities and implement key recovery attacks using signals---extracted through different techniques such as timing, microarchitecture, and EM---and improved lattice methods.",

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become one of the enabling technologies in many safety-critical applications, e.g., autonomous driving and medical image analysis. DNN systems, however, suffer from various kinds of threats, such as adversarial example attacks and fault injection attacks. While there are many defense methods proposed against maliciously crafted inputs, solutions against faults presented in the DNN system itself (e.g., parameters and calculations) are far less explored. In this paper, we develop a novel lightweight fault-tolerant solution for DNN-based systems, namely DeepDyve, which employs pre-trained neural networks that are far simpler and smaller than the original DNN for dynamic verification. The key to enabling such lightweight checking is that the smaller neural network only needs to produce approximate results for the initial task without sacrificing fault coverage much. We develop efficient and effective architecture and task exploration techniques to achieve optimized risk/overhead trade-off in DeepDyve. Experimental results show that DeepDyve can reduce 90% of the risks at around 10% overhead.",

In order to carry out rehabilitation training for patients, a variety of power-assist robots has been studied. On the other hand, it has been shown that a motion change induced by the reflection phenomenon and the kinesthetic illusion can be generated by stimulating the specific muscles with vibration stimulation during upper-limb movement. Artificially generating the intended motion or giving the movement sensation by adding vibration stimulation may be an alternative method to realize the rehabilitation training. Because In this study, change of ankle joint movement based on the vibration stimulation of the tibialis anterior muscle of the lower-limb is studied by performing the experiment of adding vibration stimulation to the tibialis anterior muscle during the movement of ankle joint dorsiflexion and plantar flexion, and then the possibility of its application to rehabilitation training is evaluated.",

        "title": "Forensic Analysis in Access Control: Foundations and a Case-Study from Practice",
        "abstract": "We pose and study forensic analysis in the context of access control systems in a manner that prior work has not. Forensics seeks to answer questions about past states of a system, and thereby provides important clues and evidence in the event of a security incident. Access control deals with who may perform what action on a resource and is a critical security function. Our focus is access control systems that allow for changes to the authorization state to be delegated to potentially untrusted users. We argue that this context in access control is an important one in which to consider forensic analysis, and observe that it is a natural complement of safety analysis, which has been considered extensively in the literature. We pose the forensic analysis problem for such access control systems abstractly, and instantiate it for three schemes from the literature: a well-known access matrix scheme, a role-based scheme, and a discretionary scheme. We identify the computational complexity of forensic analysis, and compare it to that of safety analysis for each of the schemes. We consider also the notion of logs, i.e., data that can be collected over time to aid forensic analysis. We present results for sufficient and minimal logs that render forensic analysis for the three schemes efficient. This motivates discussions on goal-directed logging, with the explicit intent of aiding forensic analysis. We carry out a case-study in the realistic setting of a serverless cloud application, and observe that goal-directed logging can be highly effective. Our work makes contributions at the foundations of information security, and its practical implications.",

        "abstract": "Evaluation of education systems is a discourse practice that has spread throughout the world since the end of the last century. It is usually presented as a mechanism for modernising education or research according to European or world-wide standards. In this article it is sustained the thesis that academic evaluation is structured as a tool to discipline institutions and subjects. Firstly, the audit culture is contextualized because the historical, economic and political perspective clarifies the phenomenon on a global scale and gives it meaning as a mechanism of power. Secondly, the role played by some key instances and discourses are analyzed. Finally, the limitations to some questions about the evaluation system are presented.",

        "abstract": "Currently, there are a lot of active studies in the medical and healthcare field using information technology and artificial intelligence (AI). In this talk, I will focus on the fusion research of AI and reproductive medicine, and discuss the usefulness. I will talk about the following topics. (1) Detection of thick seminiferous tubules in the testicles: In micro-TESE surgery is performed using a microscope, and the seminiferous tubules that produce sperm are removed, and the sperm is collected from the removed seminiferous tubules. This sperm collection surgery for patients with non-obstructive azoospermia requires incision of the testes. This damage needs to be minimized, and this cost must be saved. Therefore, it is required for both surgeons and patients to non-invasively detect the presence of sperm in the testes before this operation. In this study, we detect the seminiferous tubules with a diameter of 250-300 micrometer that can recover sperm using ultrasound technique. However, currently used ultrasonic waves of about 8 MHz cannot find a fine tube of this diameter by the low resolution. Thus, we found a characteristic that the peak frequency of the ultrasonic reflected wave is proportional to the reciprocal of the diameter, and estimated the diameter of the seminiferous tubule present in the testicle based on fuzzy inference. (2) Supporting of ovum collection surgery: At the time of surgery to collect ova, an ultrasonic system is generally used. However, the follicles watched by the ultrasound system do not always contain ovum, and there are follicles that do not contain ovum is called vacuole. It is not possible in terms of resolution to confirm the vacuoles with ultrasound images before their removal, and the presence or absence of ovum is only known after collection. Therefore, we developed detection software of vacuoles using AI. (3) Determining the insertion position of sperm that does not cause rupture on the ovum: In micro-insemination, a sperm is directly injected into an ovum collected from a woman using a pipette. When injecting sperm, the oval cell membrane is usually sufficiently extended with a pipette, and then rupture is performed by piezo pulse. However, rupture may occur during the development of the membrane, in which case the insemination rate is reduced. Therefore, we quantitatively evaluate the effect of puncture position on ruptured membrane from ovum images during micro-insemination, and develop a system that can perform puncture based on the evaluation. (4) Analysis of peristalsis of the uterus: The uterus performs a movement called uterine peristalsis to transport sperm. It is known that the direction and frequency of uterine peristalsis change according to the menstrual cycle. We developed a system to evaluate peristalsis of the uterus by Cine-MRI analysis, and an evaluation system of peristaltic movement frequency by the clinical ultrasonic image analysis. Finally, I would like to consider the future role of AI in the medical and health fields.",

        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance in learning node representations for various graph inference tasks. However, learning over graph data can raise privacy concerns when nodes represent people or human-related variables that involve sensitive or personal information. In this paper, we study the problem of node data privacy, where graph nodes (e.g., social network users) have potentially sensitive data that is kept private, but they could be beneficial for a central server for training a GNN over the graph. To address this problem, we propose a privacy-preserving, architecture-agnostic GNN learning framework with formal privacy guarantees based on Local Differential Privacy (LDP). Specifically, we develop a locally private mechanism to perturb and compress node features, which the server can efficiently collect to approximate the GNN's neighborhood aggregation step. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of the estimation, we prepend to the GNN a denoising layer, called KProp, which is based on the multi-hop aggregation of node features. Finally, we propose a robust algorithm for learning with privatized noisy labels, where we again benefit from KProp's denoising capability to increase the accuracy of label inference for node classification. Extensive experiments conducted over real-world datasets demonstrate that our method can maintain a satisfying level of accuracy with low privacy loss.",

        "abstract": "Tor is a powerful and important tool for providing anonymity and censorship resistance to users around the world. Yet it is surprisingly difficult to deploy new services in Tor---it is largely relegated to proxies and hidden services---or to nimbly react to new forms of attack. Conversely, \"non-anonymous\" Internet services are thriving like never before because of recent advances in programmable networks, such as Network Function Virtualization (NFV) which provides programmable in-network middleboxes. This work seeks to close this gap by introducing programmable middleboxes into the Tor network. In this architecture, users can install and run sophisticated \"functions\" on willing Tor routers,further improving anonymity, resilience to attack, performance of hidden services, and more. We present the design of an architecture, Bento, that protects middlebox nodes from the functions they run and protects the functions from the middleboxes they run on. Bento does not require modifications to Tor, and can run on the live Tor network. Additionally, we give an overview of how we can significantly extend the capabilities of Tor to meet users' anonymity needs and nimbly react to new threats.",

        "title": "Talking with Familiar Strangers: An Empirical Study on HTTPS Context Confusion Attacks",
        "abstract": "HTTPS is principally designed for secure end-to-end communication, which adds confidentiality and integrity to sensitive data transmission. While several man-in-the-middle attacks (e.g., SSL Stripping) are available to break the secured connections, state-of-the-art security policies (e.g., HSTS) have significantly increased the cost of successful attacks. However, the TLS certificates shared by multiple domains make HTTPS hijacking attacks possible again. In this paper, we term the HTTPS MITM attacks based on the shared TLS certificates as HTTPS Context Confusion Attack (SCC Attack). Despite a known threat, it has not yet been studied thoroughly. We aim to fill this gap with an in-depth empirical assessment of SCC Attack. We find the attack can succeed even for servers that have deployed current best practice of security policies. By rerouting encrypted traffic to another flawed server that shares the TLS certificate, attackers can bypass the security practices, hijack the ongoing HTTPS connections, and subsequently launch additional attacks including phishing and payment hijacking. Particularly, vulnerable HTTP headers from a third-party server are exploitable for this attack, and it is possible to hijack an already-established secure connection. Through tests on popular websites, we find vulnerable subdomains under 126 apex domains in Alexa top 500 sites, including large vendors like Alibaba, JD, and Microsoft. Meanwhile, through a large-scale measurement, we find that TLS certificate sharing is prominent, which uncovers the high potential of such attacks, and we summarize the security dependencies among different parties. For responsible disclosure, we have reported the issues to affected vendors and received positive feedback. Our study sheds light on an influential attack surface of the HTTPS ecosystem and calls for proper mitigation against MITM attacks.",

        "abstract": "Preeclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal deaths and pregnancy-related complications in many low-income countries. Factors related to preeclampsia include lack of prenatal care and access to medical services, lack of facilities, and inadequate diagnosis and treatment of preeclampsia patients. Early detection and prompt treatment of preeclampsia are essential for the prevention of eclampsia and other life-threatening complications. Several studies have developed the risk prediction models for preeclampsia using mobile applications and machine learning techniques. The use of a soft voting-based ensemble method and recommendation system for women at high risk of preeclampsia remains unexplored. We developed a mobile application with two functionalities of preeclampsia prediction and recommendation system for women at high risk of preeclampsia. We employed the soft voting ensemble learning for the preeclampsia prediction. We obtained a high accuracy value of 98.51% \u00b1 0.0186% compared to the six individual classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbors, Linear SVM, RBF SVM, Gaussian Process, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Ada Boost). Our proposed recommender system also yielded in a high accuracy value of 96.66% \u00b1 0.0229%. Both our proposed ensemble based on soft-voting and recommendation system had small variance values, which indicated high stability.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a just-in-time approach to introduce adaptive planning in personal daily context. Adaptive planning is known to be effective in agile development, which is expected to be useful for our daily life as well. The chatbot-based approach has been proposed for modeling personal daily context as user story graph. This paper extends this approach by adopting the design of sprint planning. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a short-term real-world simulation using a storytelling interface is conducted. The result shows that the proposed adaptive planning framework could lead to better decision-making during individual\u2019s daily life.",

        "abstract": "In the past few years, we have seen multiple attacks on one-dimensional databases that support range queries. These attacks achieve full database reconstruction by exploiting access pattern leakage along with known query distribution or search pattern leakage. We are the first to go beyond one dimension, exploring this threat in two dimensions. We unveil an intrinsic limitation of reconstruction attacks by showing that there can be an exponential number of distinct databases that produce equivalent leakage. Next, we present a full database reconstruction attack. Our algorithm runs in polynomial time and returns a poly-size encoding of all databases consistent with the given leakage profile. We implement our algorithm and observe real-world databases that admit a large number of equivalent databases, which aligns with our theoretical results.",

User privacy and data security are drawing much attention over the recent years, especially with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other laws coming into force. On one hand, from the customers' perspective, how to protect user privacy while making use of customers? data is a challenging task. On the other hand, data silos are becoming one of the most prominent issues for the society. From the business? perspective, how to bridge these isolated data islands to build better AI systems while meeting the data privacy and regulatory compliance requirements has imposed great challenges to the traditional machine learning paradigm. PPMLP will provide an opportunity to connect researchers from both CCS community and machine learning community to tackle these challenges.",

        "title": "SQUIRREL: Testing Database Management Systems with Language Validity and Coverage Feedback",
        "abstract": "Fuzzing is an increasingly popular technique for verifying software functionalities and finding security vulnerabilities. However, current mutation-based fuzzers cannot effectively test database management systems (DBMSs), which strictly check inputs for valid syntax and semantics. Generation-based testing can guarantee the syntax correctness of the inputs, but it does not utilize any feedback, like code coverage, to guide the path exploration. In this paper, we develop Squirrel, a novel fuzzing framework that considers both language validity and coverage feedback to test DBMSs. We design an intermediate representation (IR) to maintain SQL queries in a structural and informative manner. To generate syntactically correct queries, we perform type-based mutations on IR, including statement insertion, deletion and replacement. To mitigate semantic errors, we analyze each IR to identify the logical dependencies between arguments, and generate queries that satisfy these dependencies. We evaluated Squirrel on four popular DBMSs: SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL and MariaDB. Squirrel found 51 bugs in SQLite, 7 in MySQL and 5 in MariaDB. 52 of the bugs are fixed with 12 CVEs assigned. In our experiment, Squirrel achieves 2.4\u00d7-243.9\u00d7 higher semantic correctness than state-of-the-art fuzzers, and explores 2.0\u00d7-10.9\u00d7 more new edges than mutation-based tools. These results show that Squirrel is effective in finding memory errors of database management systems.",

        "title": "Fast Database Joins and PSI for Secret Shared Data",
        "abstract": "We present a scalable protocol for database joins on secret shared data in the honest-majority three-party setting. The key features of our protocol are a rich set of SQL-like join/select queries and the ability to compose join operations together due to the inputs and outputs being generically secret shared between the parties. Provided that all joins operate on unique primary keys, no information is revealed to any party during the protocol. In particular, not even the sizes of intermediate joins are revealed. All of our protocols are constant-round and achieve O(n) communication and computation overhead for joining two tables of n rows. These properties make our protocol ideal for outsourced secure computation. In this setting several non-colluding servers are setup and the input data is shared among them. These servers then perform the relevant secret shared computation and output the result. This model has recently been gaining traction in industry, e.g. Facebook's Crypten, Cape Privacy's TFEncrypted, Mozilla Telemetry. We additionally implement two applications on top of our framework. The first application detects voter registration errors within and between agencies of 50 US states, in a privacy-preserving manner. The second application allows several organizations to compare network security logs to more accurately identify common security threats, e.g. the IP addresses of a bot net. In both cases, the practicality of these applications depends on efficiently performing joins on millions of secret shared records. For example, our three party protocol can perform a join on two sets of 1 million records in 4.9 seconds or, alternatively, compute the cardinality of this join in just 3.1 seconds.",

        "title": "WI is Almost Enough: Contingent Payment All Over Again",
        "abstract": "The problem of fair exchange consists of interchanging goods between two parties that do not trust each other. Despite known impossibility results, recent works leverage the block-chain and zero-knowledge proofs to implement zero-knowledge contingent payment (zkCP) systems that make fair exchange of digital goods possible. Implementing these systems in a secure and efficient way is a big challenge, as evidenced by several unsuccessful attempts from the literature. Campanelli et al. (ACM CCS 2017) discovered a vulnerability on an existing zkCP proposal based on SNARKs (succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge) and suggested several repairs. Fuchsbauer (ACM CCS 2019) found a flaw in the mentioned countermeasures. In particular, he showed that witness-indistinguishability (WI) is not sufficient for the zkCP schemes proposed by Campanelli et al. to be secure. In this work, we observe that a slightly stronger notion of WI, that we coin trapdoor subversion WI (tS-WI), rules out Fuchsbauer's attack. We formally define security properties for CP systems and show that, under tS-WI, Campanelli et al.'s proposal indeed satisfies these properties. Additionally, we explore alternative approaches to implement ZK (other than SNARKs) and develop a prototype, using it to demonstrate their potential. Our new ideas result in a protocol to sell ECDSA signatures with contingent payment that can be executed in less than $150$ milliseconds over a LAN network.",

        "abstract": "Online gaming, with a reported 152 billion US dollar market, is immensely popular today. One of the critical issues in multiplayer online games is cheating, in which a player uses an illegal methodology to create an advantage beyond honest game play. For example, wallhacks, the main focus of this work, animate enemy objects on a cheating player's screen, despite being actually hidden behind walls (or other occluding objects). Since such cheats discourage honest players and cause game companies to lose revenue, gaming companies deploy mitigation solutions alongside game applications on the player's machine. However, their solutions are fundamentally flawed since they are deployed on a machine where the attacker has absolute control.",

        "title": "FREEDOM: Engineering a State-of-the-Art DOM Fuzzer",
        "abstract": "The DOM engine of a web browser is a popular attack surface and has been thoroughly fuzzed during its development. A common approach adopted by the latest DOM fuzzers is to generate new inputs based on context-free grammars. However, such a generative approach fails to capture the data dependencies in the inputs of a DOM engine, namely, HTML documents. Meanwhile, it is unclear whether or not coverage-guided mutation, which is well-known to be effective in fuzzing numerous software, still remains to be effective against DOM engines. Worse yet, existing DOM fuzzers cannot adopt a coverage-guided approach because they are unable to fully support HTML mutation and suffer from low browser throughput. To scientifically understand the effectiveness and limitations of the two approaches, we propose FreeDom, a full-fledged cluster-friendly DOM fuzzer that works with both generative and coverage-guided modes. FreeDom relies on a context-aware intermediate representation to describe HTML documents with proper data dependencies. FreeDom also exhibits up to 3.74x higher throughput through browser self-termination. FreeDom has found 24 previously unknown bugs in commodity browsers including Safari, Firefox, and Chrome, and 10 CVEs has been assigned so far. With the context-aware generation, FreeDom finds 3x more unique crashes in WebKit than the state-of-the-art DOM fuzzer, Domato. FreeDom guided by coverage is more effective in revealing new code blocks (2.62%) and finds three complex bugs that its generative approach fails to find. However, coverage-guided mutation that bootstraps with an empty corpus triggers 3.8x fewer unique crashes than the generative approach. The newly revealed coverage, more often than not, negatively affects the effectiveness of DOM fuzzers in bug finding. Therefore, we consider context-aware generation the best practice to find more DOM engine bugs and expect further improvement on coverage-guided DOM fuzzing facilitated by FreeDom.",

        "title": "Blinder -- Scalable, Robust Anonymous Committed Broadcast",
        "abstract": "Anonymous Committed Broadcast is a functionality that extends DC-nets and allows a set of clients to privately commit messages to set of servers, which can then simultaneously open all committed messages in a random ordering. Anonymity holds since no one can learn the ordering or the content of the client's committed message. We present Blinder, the first system that provides a scalable and fully robust solution for anonymous committed broadcast. Blinder maintains both properties of security (anonymity) and robustness (aka. 'guaranteed output delivery' or 'availability') in the face of a global active (malicious) adversary. Moreover, Blinder is censorship resistant, that is, an honest client cannot be blocked from participating. Blinder obtains its security and scalability by carefully combining classical and state-of-the-art techniques from the fields of anonymous communication and secure multiparty computation (MPC). Relying on MPC for such a system is beneficial since it naturally allows the parties (servers) to enforce some properties on accepted messages prior their publication. A GPU based implementation of Blinder with 5 servers, which accepts 1 million clients, incurs a latency of less than 8 minutes; faster by a factor of $>100$ than the 3-servers Riposte protocol (S&P '15), which is not robust and not censorship resistant; we get an even larger factor when comparing to AsynchroMix and PowerMix (CCS '19), which are the only ones that guarantee fairness (or robustness in the online phase).",

We propose a two-stage system that first identifies malicious extensions based on anomalous extension ratings and locates the code that was added to a benign extension in order to make it malicious. We encode these code deltas according to the APIs that they abuse and search our historical dataset for other similar deltas of extensions which have not yet been flagged, neither by users nor by Chrome's Web Store. We were able to discover 143 malicious extensions belonging to 21 malicious clusters, exhibiting a wide range of abuse, from history stealing and ad injection, to the hijacking of new tabs and search engines. Our results show that our proposed techniques operate in an abuse-agnostic way and can identify malicious extensions that are evading detection.",

        "abstract": "We present Privaros, a framework to enforce privacy policies on drones. Privaros is designed for commercial delivery drones, such as the ones that will likely be used by Amazon Prime Air. Such drones visit various host airspaces, each of which may have different privacy requirements. Privaros uses mandatory access control to enforce the policies of these hosts on guest delivery drones. Privaros is tailored for ROS, a middleware popular in many drone platforms. This paper presents the design and implementation of Privaros's policy-enforcement mechanisms, describes how policies are specified, and shows that policy specification can be integrated with India's Digital Sky portal. Our evaluation shows that a drone running Privaros can robustly enforce various privacy policies specified by hosts, and that its core mechanisms only marginally increase communication latency and power consumption.",

        "abstract": "We investigate whether modern messaging apps achieve the strong post-compromise security guarantees offered by their underlying protocols. In particular, we perform a black-box experiment in which a user becomes the victim of a clone attack; in this attack, the user's full state (including identity keys) is compromised by an attacker who clones their device and then later attempts to impersonate them, using the app through its user interface. Our attack should be prevented by protocols that offer post-compromise security, and thus, by all apps that are based on Signal's double-ratchet algorithm (for instance, the Signal app, WhatsApp, and Facebook Secret Conversations). Our experiments reveal that this is not the case: most deployed messaging apps fall far short of the security that their underlying mechanisms suggest. We conjecture that this security gap is a result of many apps trading security for usability, by tolerating certain forms of desynchronization. We show that the tolerance of desynchronization necessarily leads to loss of post-compromise security in the strict sense, but we also show that more security can be retained than is currently offered in practice. Concretely, we present a modified version of the double-ratchet algorithm that tolerates forms of desynchronization while still being able to detect cloning activity. Moreover, we formally analyze our algorithm using the Tamarin prover to show that it achieves the desired security properties.",

Related literature shows that it can surpass human performance, and some can even defeat human. This paper is mainly based on the combination of reinforcement learning and deep learning, called Deep Q-Network, to learn the action response of game NS-SHAFT autonomously. Based on a personal computer, we built an experimental learning environment that automatically captures the NS-SHAFT\u2019s frame which is provided to DQN to decide the action of moving left, moving right, or stay in same location, survey different parameters: such as the learning cycle, different reward settings, and exploration / exploit ratios etc., which affect the learning effectiveness. The experimental results show that moderate parameter settings have a certain degree of impact on the DQN learning effect.",

        "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems are increasingly threatened by sophisticated attackers, also attacking the physical aspect of systems. Supplementing protective measures, industrial intrusion detection systems promise to detect such attacks. However, due to industrial protocol diversity and lack of standard interfaces, great efforts are required to adapt these technologies to a large number of different protocols. To address this issue, we identify existing universally applicable intrusion detection approaches and propose a transcription for industrial protocols to realize protocol-independent semantic intrusion detection on top of different industrial protocols.",

        "abstract": "\n\nSelection of Sustainable Suppliers is a key term in sustainable supply\nchain management. This is the reason to choose the supplier who will support the company to implement\nsustainability in its business, especially in the supply chain.\n\n\n\nThe aim of this paper is to establish a new innovative model for decision-making based\non a fuzzy approach.\n\n\n\nThis decision-making problem is solved by applying multi-criteria decision-making\nsince there are several criteria according to which a decision should be made: economic, social, and\nenvironmental. In order to make the final decision on the supply chain better and safer, the social\ncriteria were modified in this paper, adding ethical criteria. The example with modified social criteria\nin this paper was shown on the example of the company \"Vo\u0107ar\" Br\u010dko, which deals with the\nproduction of food products. In this paper, the fuzzy Measurement Alternatives and Ranking, according\nto the Compromise Solution Method, was used.\n\n\n\nThe findings have shown that supplier A1 has the best results, which were confirmed with\nthe first sensitivity analysis. However, the second sensitivity analysis has shown that supplier A5\nwas better than supplier A1 in 14 scenarios. Due to these findings, no unanimous decision can be\nmade about which supplier among the two, in this case, would contribute more.\n\n\n\nThis paper has shown that the selection of sustainable suppliers is crucial for any\ncompany focused on the principles of sustainability in business. Moreover, this paper has shown\nthat it is sometimes very difficult to select just one supplier.\n",

Unfortunately, attackers that have escalated privilege on a host are typically able to delete and modify log events at will. In response to this threat, a variety of secure logging systems have appeared over the years that attempt to provide tamper-resistance (e.g., write once read many drives, remote storage servers) or tamper-evidence (e.g., cryptographic proofs) for system logs. These solutions expose an interface through which events are committed to a secure log, at which point they enjoy protection from future tampering. However, all proposals to date have relied on the assumption that an event's occurrence is concomitant with its commitment to the secured log. In this work, we challenge this assumption by presenting and validating a race condition attack on the integrity of audit frameworks. Our attack exploits the intrinsically asynchronous nature of I/O and IPC activity, demonstrating that an attacker can snatch events about their intrusion out of message buffers after they have occurred but before they are committed to the log, thus bypassing existing protections. We present a first step towards defending against our attack by introducing KennyLoggings, the first kernel- based tamper-evident logging system that satisfies the synchronous integrity property, meaning that it guarantees tamper-evidence of events upon their occurrence. We implement KennyLoggings on top of the Linux kernel and show that it imposes between 8% and 11% overhead on log-intensive application workloads.",

        "title": "iDEA: Static Analysis on the Security of Apple Kernel Drivers",
        "abstract": "Drivers on Apple OSes (e.g., iOS, tvOS, iPadOS, macOS, etc.) run in the kernel space and driver vulnerabilities can incur serious security consequences. A recent report from Google Project Zero shows that driver vulnerabilities on Apple OSes have been actively exploited in the wild. Also, we observed that driver vulnerabilities have accounted for one-third of kernel bugs in recent iOS versions based on Apple's security updates. Despite the serious security implications, systematic static analysis on Apple drivers for finding security vulnerabilities has never been done before, not to mention any large-scale study of Apple drivers. In this paper, we developed the first automatic, static analysis tool iDEA for finding bugs in Apple driver binaries, which is applicable to major Apple OSes (iOS, macOS, tvOS, iPadOS). We summarized and tackled a set of Apple-unique challenges: for example, we show that prior C++ binary analysis techniques are ineffective (i.e., failing to recover C++ classes and resolve indirect calls) on Apple platform due to Apple's unique programming model. To solve the challenges, we found a reliable information source from Apple's driver programming and management model to recover classes, and identified the unique paradigms through which Apple drivers interact with user-space programs. iDEA supports customized, pluggable security policy checkers for its security analysis. Enabled by iDEA, we performed the first large-scale study of 3,400 Apple driver binaries across major Apple OSes and 15 OS versions with respect to two common types of security risks - race condition and out-of-bound read/write, and discovered 35 zero-day bugs. We developed PoC and end-to-end attacks to demonstrate the practical impacts of our findings. A portion of the bugs have been patched by recent Apple security updates or are scheduled to be fixed; others are going through Apple's internal investigation procedure. Our evaluation showed that iDEA incurs a low false-positive rate and time overhead.",

        "abstract": "Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) with their trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) provide the trust backbone for the Internet: CAs sign certificates which prove the identity of servers, applications, or users. To be trusted by operating systems and browsers, a CA has to undergo lengthy and costly validation processes. Alternatively, trusted CAs can cross-sign other CAs to extend their trust to them. In this paper, we systematically analyze the present and past state of cross-signing in the Web PKI. Our dataset (derived from passive TLS monitors and public CT logs) encompasses more than 7 years and 225 million certificates with 9.3 billion trust paths. We show benefits and risks of cross-signing. We discuss the difficulty of revoking trusted CA certificates where, worrisome, cross-signing can result in valid trust paths to remain after revocation; a problem for non-browser software that often blindly trusts all CA certificates and ignores revocations. However, cross-signing also enables fast bootstrapping of new CAs, e.g., Let's Encrypt, and achieves a non-disruptive user experience by providing backward compatibility. In this paper, we propose new rules and guidance for cross-signing to preserve its positive potential while mitigating its risks.",

        "title": "TRUSTORE: Side-Channel Resistant Storage for SGX using Intel Hybrid CPU-FPGA",
        "abstract": "Intel SGX is a security solution promising strong and practical security guarantees for trusted computing. However, recent reports demonstrated that such security guarantees of SGX are broken due to access pattern based side-channel attacks, including page fault, cache, branch prediction, and speculative execution. In order to stop these side-channel attackers, Oblivious RAM (ORAM) has gained strong attention from the security community as it provides cryptographically proven protection against access pattern based side-channels. While several proposed systems have successfully applied ORAM to thwart side-channels, those are severely limited in performance and its scalability due to notorious performance issues of ORAM. This paper presents TrustOre, addressing these issues that arise when using ORAM with Intel SGX. TrustOre leverages an external device, FPGA, to implement a trusted storage service within a completed isolated environment secure from side-channel attacks. TrustOre tackles several challenges in achieving such a goal: extending trust from SGX to FPGA without imposing architectural changes, providing a verifiably-secure connection between SGX applications and FPGA, and seamlessly supporting various access operations from SGX applications to FPGA.We implemented TrustOre on the commodity Intel Hybrid CPU-FPGA architecture. Then we evaluated with three state-of-the-art ORAM-based SGX applications, ZeroTrace, Obliviate, and Obfuscuro, as well as an end-to-end key-value store application. According to our evaluation, TrustOre-based applications outperforms ORAM-based original applications ranging from 10x to 43x, while also showing far better scalability than ORAM-based ones. We emphasize that since TrustOre can be deployed as a simple plug-in to SGX machine's PCIe slot, it is readily used to thwart side-channel attacks in SGX, arguably one of the most cryptic and critical security holes today.",

        "abstract": "Building on the Gennaro & Goldfeder and Lindell & Nof protocols (CCS '18), we present two threshold ECDSA protocols, for any number of signatories and any threshold, that improve as follows over the state of the art: -- For both protocols, only the last round requires knowledge of the message, and the other rounds can take place in a preprocessing stage, lending to a non-interactive threshold ECDSA protocol. -- Both protocols withstand adaptive corruption of signatories. Furthermore, they include a periodic refresh mechanism and offer full proactive security. -- Both protocols realize an ideal threshold signature functionality within the UC framework, in the global random oracle model, assuming Strong RSA, DDH, semantic security of the Paillier encryption, and a somewhat enhanced variant of existential unforgeability of ECDSA. -- Both protocols achieve accountability by identifying corrupted parties in case of failure to generate a valid signature. The two protocols are distinguished by the round-complexity and the identification process for detecting cheating parties. Namely: -- For the first protocol, signature generation takes only 4 rounds (down from the current state of the art of 8 rounds), but the identification process requires computation and communication that is quadratic in the number of parties. -- For the second protocol, the identification process requires computation and communication that is only linear in the number of parties, but signature generation takes 7 rounds. These properties (low latency, compatibility with cold-wallet architectures, proactive security, identifiable abort and composable security) make the two protocols ideal for threshold wallets for ECDSA-based cryptocurrencies.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the security implication of stale NS records, which point to a nameserver that no longer resolves the domain, has been unveiled. Prior research studied the stale DNS records that point to expired domains. The popularity of DNS hosting services brings in a new category of stale NS records, which reside in the domain's zone (instead of the TLD zone) for an active domain. To the best of our knowledge, the security risk of this kind of stale NS record has never been studied before. In our research, we show that this new type of stale NS record can be practically exploited, causing a stealthier hijack of domains associated with the DNS hosting service. We also performed a large-scale analysis on over 1M high-profile domains, 17 DNS hosting providers and 12 popular public resolver operators to confirm the prevalence of this security risk. Our research further discovers 628 hijackable domains (e.g., 6 government entities and 2 payment services), 14 affected DNS hosting providers (e.g., Amazon Route 53), and 10 vulnerable public resolver operators (e.g., CloudFlare). Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth measurement analysis on them, thus providing a better understanding of this new security risk. Also, we explore the mitigation techniques that can be adopted by different affected parties.",

        "abstract": "A verifiable timed signature (VTS) scheme allows one to time-lock a signature on a known message for a given amount of time T such that after performing a sequential computation for time T anyone can extract the signature from the time-lock. Verifiability ensures that anyone can publicly check if a time-lock contains a valid signature on the message without solving it first, and that the signature can be obtained by solving the same for time T. This work formalizes VTS, presents efficient constructions compatible with BLS, Schnorr, and ECDSA signatures, and experimentally demonstrates that these constructions can be employed in practice. On a technical level, we design an efficient cut-and-choose protocol based on the homomorphic time-lock puzzles to prove the validity of a signature encapsulated in a time-lock puzzle. We also present a new efficient range proof protocol that significantly improves upon existing proposals in terms of the proof size, and is also of independent interest. While VTS is a versatile tool with numerous existing applications, we demonstrate VTS's applicability to resolve three novel challenging issues in the space of cryptocurrencies. Specifically,we show how VTS is the cryptographic cornerstone to construct:(i) Payment channel networks with improved on-chain unlinkability of users involved in a transaction, (ii) multi-party signing of transactions for cryptocurrencies without any on-chain notion oftime and (iii) cryptocurrency-enabled fair multi-party computation protocol.",

        "abstract": "Today, Bluetooth 4.0, also known as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), has been widely used in many IoT devices (e.g., smart locks, smart sensors, and wearables). However, BLE devices could contain a number of vulnerabilities at the BLE link layer during broadcasting, pairing, and message transmission. To detect these vulnerabilities directly from the bare-metal firmware, we present FirmXRay, the first static binary analysis tool with a set of enabling techniques including a novel base address identification algorithm for robust firmware disassembling, precise data structure recognition, and configuration value resolution. As a proof-of-concept, we focus on the BLE firmware from two leading SoC vendors (i.e., Nordic and Texas Instruments), and implement a prototype of FirmXRay atop Ghidra. We have evaluated FirmXRay with 793 unique firmware (corresponding to 538 unique devices) collected using a mobile app based approach, and our experiment results show that 98.1% of the devices have configured random static MAC addresses, 71.5% Just Works pairing, and 98.5% insecure key exchanges. With these vulnerabilities, we demonstrate identity tracking, spoofing, and eavesdropping attacks on real-world BLE devices.",

        "abstract": "One way to explore a city is to know what people do on their leisure. Looking for local events and promotions is a common need for most people during travel or moving to a new city. However, delivering such messages to the right people is still a challenge for small businesses that do not sell tickets on high-end websites. Instead, most events are usually distributed by posting on social networking sites like Facebook. To fulfill such information need, we consider information technologies to extract events from 230K Facebook fan pages to build an event database and provide a social event search service. The technologies includes web scraping and web data extraction as well as natural language processing techniques for event names and venues recognition. We show how to speed up training data preparation through locality sensitive hashing (LSH) on seed lists based on distant supervision as well as how to improve the training data quality via double-tier automatic labeling. In addition to the demonstration of event search service provided by EventGo, we also disclose statistics in the events extracted from Facebook Fan Pages and Facebook events, showing the change in the ad market.",

        "title": "Mnemosyne: An Effective and Efficient Postmortem Watering Hole Attack Investigation System",
        "abstract": "Compromising a website that is routinely visited by employees of a targeted organization has become a popular technique for nation-state level adversaries to penetrate an enterprise's network. This technique, dubbed a \"watering hole\" attack, leverages a compromised website to serve as a stepping stone into the true victims' network. Despite watering hole attacks being one of the main techniques used by attackers to achieve the initial compromise stage of the cyber kill chain, there has been relatively little research related to detecting or investigating complex watering hole attacks. While there is existing work that seeks to detect malicious modifications made to an otherwise benign website, we argue that simply detecting that the website is compromised is only the first stage of the investigation. In this paper, we propose Mnemosyne, a postmortem forensic analysis engine that relies on browser-based attack provenance to accurately reconstruct, investigate, and assess the ramifications of watering hole attacks. Mnemosyne relies on a lightweight browser-modification-free auditing daemon to passively collect causality logs related to the browser's execution. Next, Mnemosyne applies a set of versioning techniques on top of these causality logs to precisely pinpoint when the website was compromised and what modifications were made by the adversary. Following this step, Mnemosyne relies on a novel user-level analysis to assess how the malicious modifications affected the targeted enterprise and seeks to identify exactly which employees fell victim to the attack. Throughout our extensive evaluation, we found that Mnemosyne's forensic analysis engine was able to identify the true victims in all seven real-world watering hole scenarios, while also reducing the amount of manual analysis required by the forensic analyst by 98.17% on average.",

        "abstract": "Remote censorship measurement techniques offer capabilities for monitoring Internet reachability around the world. However, operating these techniques continuously is labor-intensive and requires specialized knowledge and synchronization, leading to limited adoption. In this paper, we introduce Censored Planet, an online censorship measurement platform that collects and analyzes measurements from ongoing deployments of four remote measurement techniques (Augur, Satellite/Iris, Quack, and Hyperquack). Censored Planet adopts a modular design that supports synchronized baseline measurements on six Internet protocols as well as customized measurements that target specific countries and websites. Censored Planet has already collected and published more than 21.8 billion data points of longitudinal network observations over 20 months of operation. Censored Planet complements existing censorship measurement platforms such as OONI and ICLab by offering increased scale, coverage, and continuity. We introduce a new representative censorship metric and show how time series analysis can be applied to Censored Planet's longitudinal measurements to detect 15 prominent censorship events, two-thirds of which have not been reported previously. Using trend analysis, we find increasing censorship activity in more than 100 countries, and we identify 11 categories of websites facing increasing censorship, including provocative attire, human rights issues, and news media. We hope that the continued publication of Censored Planet data helps counter the proliferation of growing restrictions to online freedom.",

        "abstract": "Many censorship circumvention tools rely on trusted proxies that allow users within censored regions to access blocked Internet content by tunneling it through a covert channel (e.g,. piggybacking on Skype video calls). However, building tools that can simultaneously (i) provide good bandwidth capacity for accommodating the typical activities of Internet users, and (ii) be secure against traffic analysis attacks has remained an open problem and a stumbling block to the practical adoption of such tools for censorship evasion. We present Protozoa, a censorship-resistant tunneling tool featuring both high-performing covert channels and strong traffic analysis resistance. To create a covert channel, a user only needs to make a video call with a trusted party located outside the censored region using a popular WebRTC streaming service, e.g., Whereby. Protozoa can then covertly tunnel all IP traffic from unmodified user applications (e.g., Firefox) through the WebRTC video stream. This is achieved by hooking into the WebRTC stack and replacing the encoded video frame data with IP packet payload, while ensuring that the payload of the WebRTC stream remains encrypted, and the stream's statistical properties remain in all identical to those of any common video call. This technique allows for sustaining enough throughput to enable common-use Internet applications, e.g., web browsing or bulk data transfer, and avoid detection by state-of-the-art traffic analysis attacks. We show that Protozoa is able to evade state-level censorship in China, Russia, and India.",

        "abstract": "We propose CheckDP, an automated and integrated approach for proving or disproving claims that a mechanism is differentially private. CheckDP can find counterexamples for mechanisms with subtle bugs for which prior counterexample generators have failed. Furthermore, it was able to automatically generate proofs for correct mechanisms for which no formal verification was reported before. CheckDP is built on static program analysis, allowing it to be more efficient and precise in catching infrequent events than sampling based counterexample generators (which run mechanisms hundreds of thousands of times to estimate their output distribution). Moreover, its sound approach also allows automatic verification of correct mechanisms. When evaluated on standard benchmarks and newer privacy mechanisms, CheckDP generates proofs (for correct mechanisms) and counterexamples (for incorrect mechanisms) within 70 seconds without any false positives or false negatives.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an AI-FML robotic agent for student learning behavior ontology construction which can be applied in English speaking and listening domain. The AI-FML robotic agent with the ontology contains the perception intelligence, computational intelligence, and cognition intelligence for analyzing student learning behavior. In addition, there are three intelligent agents, including a perception agent, a computational agent, and a cognition agent in the AI-FML robotic agent. We deploy the perception agent and the cognition agent on the robot Kebbi Air. Moreover, the computational agent with the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model is performed in the cloud and can communicate with the perception agent and cognition agent via the Internet. The proposed AI-FML robotic agent is applied in Taiwan and tested in Japan. The experimental results show that the agents can be utilized in the human and machine co-learning model for the future education.",

        "abstract": "There is a rapidly growing interest in the security of cyber-physical systems (CPS) and internet-of-things (IoT) in industry, government and academia. NIST recently created a Cyber-Physical Systems group and it is leading a public-private initiative to identify a general architecture, design principles, solutions, and challenges ahead. In Europe, the Horizon 2020 research program has targeted security issues relating to cyber-physical infrastructures and Internet of Things, while the fundamental science program CHIST-ERA launched calls for research projects on resilient trustworthy cyber-physical systems (2015) and user-centered security and privacy in the Internet of Things (2016). In the US, grant calls such as the 2019 CPS grant call by NSF (total of 50M USD) show the significance of CPS&IoT and their security. In 2019, CCS accepted two workshops: One on CPS security and privacy (running 5 times in the past) and one on IoT security and privacy (running 2 times in the past). Since the topics are connected and there is some significant overlap, the Steering Committees of the two workshops have decided to merge towards delivering a world-class event on CPS&IoT security and privacy.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze fall avoidance strategies with experiments during the applied stimulation of the slipping fall. The objective is a verification whether a fall avoidance movement in a single subject will be changed or not changed by the difference of experimental conditions. There are two conditions in these experiments. One is restrained of subject's movement by a string. The other is increased a intensity of the applying stimulus in experiments. In restrained the condition, caused by limited lowly angle of the shoulder joint and the hip joint, a subject cannot swing a upper limb and a lower limb like a usual in the forward and backward direction. In the condition of the stimulus intensity, caused by control an acceleration of one side belt in split-belt treadmill, a stimulus intensity can be increased or decreased. As a result, in restrained the condition caused by limited lowly angle of the shoulder joint and the hip joint, one subject had fallen in the first half of the trial, but could avoid fall in the latter half of the trial. Therefore, it was found that even if the subject had fallen initially in a condition, the subject may have changed the fall avoidance strategy finally in order to avoid a fall in the same condition.",

        "abstract": "Malicious developers may succeed at publishing their apps in mobile markets, including the official ones. If reported, the apps will be taken down and the developer accounts possibly be banned. Unfortunately, such take-downs do not prevent the attackers to use other developer accounts to publish variations of their malicious apps. This work presents a novel approach for identifying developer accounts, and other indicators of compromise (IOCs) in mobile markets, that belong to the same operation, i.e., to the same owners. Given a set of seed IOCs, our approach explores app and version metadata to identify new IOCs that belong to the same operation. It outputs an attribution graph, which details the attribution inferences, so that they can be reviewed. We have implemented our approach into Retriever, a tool that supports multiple mobile markets including the official GooglePlay and AppleStore. We have evaluated Retriever on 17 rogueware and adware operations. In 94% of the operations, Retriever discovers at least one previously unknown developer account. Furthermore, Retriever reveals that operations that look dead still have active developer accounts.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning systems are deployed in critical settings, but they might fail in unexpected ways, impacting the accuracy of their predictions. Poisoning attacks against machine learning induce adversarial modification of data used by a machine learning algorithm to selectively change its output when it is deployed. In this work, we introduce a novel data poisoning attack called a subpopulation attack, which is particularly relevant when datasets are large and diverse. We design a modular framework for subpopulation attacks, instantiate it with different building blocks, and show that the attacks are effective for a variety of datasets and machine learning models. We further optimize the attacks in continuous domains using influence functions and gradient optimization methods. Compared to existing backdoor poisoning attacks, subpopulation attacks have the advantage of inducing misclassification in naturally distributed data points at inference time, making the attacks extremely stealthy. We also show that our attack strategy can be used to improve upon existing targeted attacks. We prove that, under some assumptions, subpopulation attacks are impossible to defend against, and empirically demonstrate the limitations of existing defenses against our attacks, highlighting the difficulty of protecting machine learning against this threat.",

        "abstract": "Efficiently integrity verification of received data requires Message Authentication Code (MAC) tags. However, while security calls for rather long tags, in many scenarios this contradicts other requirements. Examples are strict delay requirements (e.g., robot or drone control) or resource-scarce settings (e.g., LoRaWAN networks with limited battery capacity). Prior techniques suggested truncation of MAC tags, thus trading off linear performance gain for exponential security loss. To achieve security of full-length MACs with short(er) tags, we introduce Progressive MACs (ProMACs) -- a scheme that uses internal state to gradually increase security upon reception of subsequent messages. We provide a formal framework and propose a provably secure, generic construction called Whips. We evaluate applicability of ProMACs in several realistic scenarios and demonstrate example settings where ProMACs can be used as a drop-in replacement for traditional MACs.",

Al hacerlo, adelantare una critica a dicho razonamiento \u2013que es la matriz del epistemicidio\u2013, desentranare su despotismo teorico y metodologico y argumentare que el modelo de Modernidad Cartesiana Occidental, como matriz hegemonica eugenesica, con su arrogante pretension de abordar la justicia global, no solo esta moribundo, sino que esta muerto. La modernidad, fue/es un sueno enganoso, un juego acabado. En este contexto, defiendo la necesidad de abrir los canones teoricos y metodologicos, de ir mas alla de las plataformas epistemologicas Eurocentricas Occidentales Modernas, de desafiar la occidentosis educativa y curricular y de pensar alternativamente en opciones para trabajar metodologicamente hacia la justicia social y cognitiva e intergeneracional. Llamo a los educadores a liderar la lucha justa contra el epistemicidio educativo y curricular trabajando dentro de una teoria curricular educativa itinerante y una pedagogia de la sociedad, una teoria de los pueblos, defendiendo asi los dialogos no relativistas entre el Norte y el Sur global y dentro del Norte y el Sur.",

        "abstract": "With the emergence of the voice personal assistant (VPA) ecosystem, third-party developers are allowed to build new voice-apps are called skills in the Amazon Alexa platform and actions in the Google Assistant platform, respectively. For the sake of brevity, we use the term skills to describe voice-apps including Amazon skills and Google actions, unless we need to distinguish them for different VPA platforms. and publish them to the skills store, which greatly extends the functionalities of VPAs. Before a new skill becomes publicly available, that skill must pass a certification process, which verifies that it meets the necessary content and privacy policies. The trustworthiness of skill certification is of significant importance to platform providers, developers, and end users. Yet, little is known about how difficult it is for a policy-violating skill to get certified and published in VPA platforms. In this work, we study the trustworthiness of the skill certification in Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant platforms to answer three key questions: 1) Whether the skill certification process is trustworthy in terms of catching policy violations in third-party skills. 2) Whether there exist policy-violating skills published in their skills stores. 3) What are VPA users' perspectives on the skill certification and their vulnerable usage behavior when interacting with VPA devices? Over a span of 15 months, we crafted and submitted for certification 234 Amazon Alexa skills and 381 Google Assistant actions that intentionally violate content and privacy policies specified by VPA platforms. Surprisingly, we successfully got 234 (100%) policy-violating Alexa skills certified and 148 (39%) policy-violating Google actions certified. Our analysis demonstrates that policy-violating skills exist in the current skills stores, and thus users (children, in particular) are at risk when using VPA services. We conducted a user study with 203 participants to understand users' misplaced trust on VPA platforms. Unfortunately, user expectations are not being met by the skill certification in leading VPA platforms.",

        "abstract": "The Fifth Workshop on Forming an Ecosystem Around Software Transformation (FEAST) provides a forum for presentation and discussion of new tools, methodologies, and techniques facilitating the automated or semi-automated transformation and analysis of software executables for improving their security and efficiency without the benefit of any original source code whence they were developed. Late-stage software customization of this form is of particular benefit to security-conscious software consumers who must use closed-source or source-free binary software components in mission-critical settings, or who must harden software against newly emerging attacks not anticipated during the software's original design and development. However, code analysis and transformation becomes much more difficult without the aid of source-level information to provide a context for its intended operation. This outstanding challenge motivates the FEAST Workshop's goal of forming a robust ecosystem of strategies and tools for accomplishing source-free binary code transformation reliably and on-demand.",

        "abstract": "En regiones como America Latina, la mercantilizacion de la ciencia involucra su subordinacion a la produccion de innovaciones a nivel global que refuerzan las estructuras actuales de poder y el lugar dependiente de la region. Para dar cuenta de estas especificidades se propone el concepto de ciencia privatizada entendida como la ciencia que por medio de copiar agendas y prioridades exogenas al contexto de creacion del conocimiento y a las necesidades sociales (y aunque sus resultados sean publicos), igualmente beneficia la acumulacion de ganancias privadas. Lo hace sin que quede redito para las instituciones productoras de ese conocimiento, ni tampoco por lo tanto para sus paises de origen. El trabajo muestra dimensiones concretas de la ciencia privatizada, a saber: la transferencia ciega de conocimiento, la orientacion de la agenda de investigacion a prioridades de empresas o de organismos internacionales extranjeros, o copiando de manera acritica la agenda internacional mainstream , y el peso del oligopolio editorial internacional. Estas dimensiones calan hondo en la region dado que el articulo publicado en revistas internacionales con referato se privilegia como criterio de evaluacion. De modo que el trabajo concluye realizando propuestas de indicadores alternativos para la evaluacion del trabajo cientifico y tecnologico publico.",

        "abstract": "Stunting is considered an important concern in the public health of children throughout the world. Inadequate nutrition in toddlers is closely related to the risk of growth retardation, where malnutrition is caused by several risk factors in the prenatal and postnatal periods. It is necessary to improve the identification, measurement, and understanding of stunting and increase the scope of preventive stunting to reduce the number of stunting events. In this paper, we develop Android-based for early detection of the risk of stunting in pregnant women and their recommendations. We use forward chaining techniques to detect stunting, and we provide recommendations for pregnant women who are at high risk for birth. Our proposed stunt detection with forward chaining yielded in a high accuracy value of 89%.",

        "abstract": "With the rising adoption of advanced voice-based technology together with increasing consumer demand for smart devices, voice-controlled \"virtual assistants\" such as Apple's Siri and Google Assistant have been integrated into people's daily lives. However, privacy and security concerns may hinder the development of such voice-based applications since speech data contain the speaker's biometric identifier, i.e., voiceprint (as analogous to fingerprint). To alleviate privacy concerns in speech data collection, we propose a fast speech data de-identification system that allows a user to share her speech data with formal privacy guarantee to an untrusted server. Our open-sourced system can be easily integrated into other speech processing systems for collecting users' voice data in a privacy-preserving way. Experiments on public datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system.",

        "abstract": "Social robots are robots which manipulate the social world, rather than the physical world of traditional robotics. Their appearance and behaviour is designed to tap into the human desire for social interaction. Because social interaction comes naturally to all of us, there is a misconception that building artificial social interaction is easy. This talk will argue that social robotics is on the one hand one of the hardest challenges in robotics but will at same time show that relatively simple designs and behaviours can go a long way in achieving social human-robot interaction. The illustrate the power of social robots the talk will focus on how social robots can be used to support education, and in specific how social robots can support children when learning a second language.",

        "abstract": "The steady reports of privacy invasions online paints a picture of the Internet growing into a more dangerous place. This is supported by reports of the potential scale for online harms facilitated by the mass deployment of online technology and by the data-intensive web. While Internet users often express concern about privacy, some report taking actions to protect their privacy online. We investigate the methods and technologies that individuals employ to protect their privacy online. We conduct two studies, of N=180 and N=907, to elicit individuals' use of privacy methods, within the US, the UK and Germany. We find that non-technology methods are among the most used methods in the three countries. We identify distinct groupings of privacy methods usage in a cluster map. The map shows that together with non-technology methods of privacy protection, simple PETs that are integrated in services, form the most used cluster, whereas more advanced PETs form a different, least used cluster. We further investigate user perception and reasoning for mostly using one set of PETs, in a third study with N=183 participants. We do not find a difference in perceived competency in protecting privacy online between advanced and simpler PETs users. We compare use perceptions between advanced and simpler PETs and report on user reasoning for not using advanced PETs, as well as support needed for potential use. This paper contributes to privacy research by eliciting use and perception of use across 43 privacy methods, including 26 PETs across three countries and provides a map of PETs usage. The cluster map provides a systematic and reliable point of reference for future user-centric investigations across PETs. Overall, this research provides a broad understanding of use and perceptions across a collection of PETs, and can lead to future research for scaling use of PETs.",

        "title": "Private Summation in the Multi-Message Shuffle Model",
        "abstract": "The shuffle model of differential privacy (Erlingsson et al. SODA 2019; Cheu et al. EUROCRYPT 2019) and its close relative encode-shuffle-analyze (Bittau et al. SOSP 2017) provide a fertile middle ground between the well-known local and central models. Similarly to the local model, the shuffle model assumes an untrusted data collector who receives privatized messages from users, but in this case a secure shuffler is used to transmit messages from users to the collector in a way that hides which messages came from which user. An interesting feature of the shuffle model is that increasing the amount of messages sent by each user can lead to protocols with accuracies comparable to the ones achievable in the central model. In particular, for the problem of privately computing the sum of n bounded real values held by n different users, Cheu et al. showed that O(sqrtn ) messages per user suffice to achieve O(1) error (the optimal rate in the central model), while Balle et al. (CRYPTO 2019) recently showed that a single message per user leads to Theta(n^1/3 ) MSE (mean squared error), a rate strictly in-between what is achievable in the local and central models. This paper introduces two new protocols for summation in the shuffle model with improved accuracy and communication trade-offs. Our first contribution is a recursive construction based on the protocol from Balle et al. mentioned above, providing poly(log log n) error with O(log log n) messages per user. The second contribution is a protocol with O(1) error and O(1) messages per user based on a novel analysis of the reduction from secure summation to shuffling introduced by Ishai et al. (FOCS 2006) (the original reduction required O(log n) messages per user). We also provide a numerical evaluation showing that our protocols provide good trade-offs between privacy, accuracy and communication for realistic values of n.",

        "title": "HoneyPLC: A Next-Generation Honeypot for Industrial Control Systems",
        "abstract": "Industrial Control Systems (ICS) provide management and control capabilities for mission-critical utilities such as the nuclear, power, water, and transportation grids. Within ICS, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) play a key role as they serve as a convenient bridge between the cyber and the physical worlds, e.g., controlling centrifuge machines in nuclear power plants. The critical roles that ICS and PLCs play have made them the target of sophisticated cyberattacks that are designed to disrupt their operation, which creates both social unrest and financial losses. In this context, honeypots have been shown to be highly valuable tools for collecting real data, e.g., malware payload, to better understand the many different methods and strategies that attackers use. However, existing state-of-the-art honeypots for PLCs lack sophisticated service simulations that are required to obtain valuable data. Worse, they cannot adapt while ICS malware keeps evolving, and attack patterns become more sophisticated. To overcome these shortcomings, we present HoneyPLC, a high-interaction, extensible, and malware collecting honeypot supporting a broad spectrum of PLCs models and vendors. Results from our experiments show that HoneyPLC exhibits a high level of camouflaging: it is identified as real devices by multiple widely used reconnaissance tools, including Nmap, Shodan's Honeyscore, the Siemens Step7 Manager, PLCinject, and PLCScan, with a high level of confidence. We deployed HoneyPLC on Amazon AWS and recorded a large amount of interesting interactions over the Internet, showing not only that attackers are in fact targeting ICS systems, but also that HoneyPLC can effectively engage and deceive them while collecting data samples for future analysis.",

        "title": "AdvPulse: Universal, Synchronization-free, and Targeted Audio Adversarial Attacks via Subsecond Perturbations",
        "abstract": "Existing efforts in audio adversarial attacks only focus on the scenarios where an adversary has prior knowledge of the entire speech input so as to generate an adversarial example by aligning and mixing the audio input with corresponding adversarial perturbation. In this work we consider a more practical and challenging attack scenario where the intelligent audio system takes streaming audio inputs (e.g., live human speech) and the adversary can deceive the system by playing adversarial perturbations simultaneously. This change in attack behavior brings great challenges, preventing existing adversarial perturbation generation methods from being applied directly. In practice, (1) the adversary cannot anticipate what the victim will say: the adversary cannot rely on their prior knowledge of the speech signal to guide how to generate adversarial perturbations; and (2) the adversary cannot control when the victim will speak: the synchronization between the adversarial perturbation and the speech cannot be guaranteed. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose AdvPulse, a systematic approach to generate subsecond audio adversarial perturbations, that achieves the capability to alter the recognition results of streaming audio inputs in a targeted and synchronization-free manner. To circumvent the constraints on speech content and time, we exploit penalty-based universal adversarial perturbation generation algorithm and incorporate the varying time delay into the optimization process. We further tailor the adversarial perturbation according to environmental sounds to make it inconspicuous to humans. Additionally, by considering the sources of distortions occurred during the physical playback, we are able to generate more robust audio adversarial perturbations that can remain effective even under over-the-air propagation. Extensive experiments on two representative types of intelligent audio systems (i.e., speaker recognition and speech command recognition) are conducted in various realistic environments. The results show that our attack can achieve an average attack success rate of over 89.6% in indoor environments and 76.0% in inside-vehicle scenarios even with loud engine and road noises.",

        "title": "A Systematic Study of Elastic Objects in Kernel Exploitation",
        "abstract": "Recent research has proposed various methods to perform kernel exploitation and bypass kernel protection. For example, security researchers have demonstrated an exploitation method that utilizes the characteristic of elastic kernel objects to bypass KASLR, disclose stack/heap cookies, and even perform arbitrary read in the kernel. While this exploitation method is considered a commonly adopted approach to disclosing critical kernel information, there is no evidence indicating a strong need for developing a new defense mechanism to limit this exploitation method. It is because the effectiveness of this exploitation method is demonstrated only on anecdotal kernel vulnerabilities. It is unclear whether such a method is useful for a majority of kernel vulnerabilities. To answer this question, we propose a systematic approach. It utilizes static/dynamic analysis methods to pinpoint elastic kernel objects and then employs constraint solving to pair them to corresponding kernel vulnerabilities. In this work, we implement our proposed method as a tool - ELOISE. Using this tool on three popular OSes (Linux, FreeBSD, and XNU), we discover that elastic objects are pervasive in general caches. Evaluating the effectiveness of these elastic objects on 40 kernel vulnerabilities across three OSes, we observe that they can enable most of the vulnerabilities to bypass KASLR and heap cookie protector. Besides, we also observe that these elastic objects can even escalate the exploitability of some vulnerabilities allowing them to perform arbitrary read in the kernel. Motivated by these observations, we further introduce a new defense mechanism to mitigate the threat of elastic kernel objects. We prototype our defense mechanism on Linux, showing this mechanism introduces negligible overhead.",

        "abstract": "I would like to share my thoughts on the interactions between machine learning and security. The good: We now have more data, more powerful machines and algorithms, and better yet, we don't need to always manually engineered the features. The ML process is now much more automated and the learned models are more powerful, and this is a positive feedback loop: more data leads to better models, which lead to more deployments, which lead to more data. All security vendors now advertise that they use ML in their products. The bad: There are more unknowns. In the past, we knew the capabilities and limitations of our security models, including the ML-based models, and understood how they can be evaded. But the state-of-the-art models such as deep neural networks are not as intelligible as classical models such as decision trees. How do we decide to deploy a deep learning-based model for security when we don't know for sure it is learned correctly? Data poisoning becomes easier. On-line learning and web-based learning use data collected in run-time and often from an open environment. Since such data is often resulted from human actions, it can be intentionally polluted, e.g., in misinformation campaigns. How do we make it harder for attackers to manipulate the training data? The ugly: Attackers will keep on exploiting the holes in ML, and automate their attacks using ML. Why don't we just secure ML? This would be no different than trying to secure our programs, and systems, and networks, so we can't. We have to prepare for ML failures. Ultimately, humans have to be involved. The question is how and when? For example, what information should a ML-based system present to humans and what input can humans provide to the system?",

        "title": "Cache-in-the-Middle (CITM) Attacks: Manipulating Sensitive Data in Isolated Execution Environments",
        "abstract": "The traditional usage of ARM TrustZone has difficulty on solving the conflicts between the manufacturers that want to minimize the trusted computing base by constraining the installation of third-party applications in the secure world and the third-party application developers who prefer to have the freedom of installing their applications into the secure world. To address this issue, researchers propose to create Isolated Execution Environments (called IEEs) in the normal world to protect the security-sensitive applications. In this paper, we perform a systematic study on the IEE data protection models and the ARM cache attributes, and discover three cache-based attacks called CITM that can be leveraged to manipulate the sensitive data protected in IEEs. Specifically, due to the inefficient and incoherent security measures on the cache that maps to the IEE memory (i.e., memory designated for IEEs), attackers in the normal world may compromise the security of IEE data by manipulating the IEE memory during concurrent execution, bypassing the security measures enforced when a security-sensitive application is suspended or finished, or misusing the incomplete security measures during IEE's context switching processes. We conduct case studies of CITM attacks on three well-known IEE systems including SANCTUARY, Ginseng, and TrustICE to illustrate the feasibility to exploit them on real hardware testbeds. Finally, we analyze the root causes of the CITM attacks and propose a countermeasure to defeat them. The experimental results show that our defense scheme has a small overhead.",

        "abstract": "Transportation using wheelchair is one of the most frequent transportation methods at home, medical and nursing care facilities. Wheelchairs are designed to be operable by passengers but often require assistance, and wheelchair assistance is a heavy burden. In order to quantitatively evaluate the physical burden of the caregiver when operating the wheelchair, it is necessary to analyze the characteristics of the force applied to the wheelchair when the caregiver operates the wheelchair. On the other hand, the optimal posture index of the caregiver when operating a wheelchair is not known, and the operation posture differs depending on the caregiver. Therefore, in this study, we compare the posture and the mechanical characteristics of multiple caregivers to operate a wheelchair, and consider the posture of the caregiver.",
