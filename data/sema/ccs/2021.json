        "abstract": "Deep neural network (DNN) has been widely utilized in many areas due to its increasingly high accuracy. However, DNN models could also produce wrong outputs due to internal errors, which may lead to severe security issues. Unlike fixing bugs in traditional computer software, tracing the errors in DNN models and fixing them are much more difficult due to the uninterpretability of DNN. In this paper, we present a novel and systematic approach to trace and fix the errors in deep learning models. In particular, we locate the error-inducing neurons that play a leading role in the erroneous output. With the knowledge of error-inducing neurons, we propose two methods to fix the errors: the neuron-flip and the neuron-fine-tuning. We evaluate our approach using five different training datasets and seven different model architectures. The experimental results demonstrate its efficacy in different application scenarios, including backdoor removal and general defects fixing.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables clients to collaborate with a server to train a machine learning model. To ensure privacy, the server performs secure aggregation of updates from the clients. Unfortunately, this prevents verification of the well-formedness (integrity) of the updates as the updates are masked. Consequently, malformed updates designed to poison the model can be injected without detection. In this paper, we formalize the problem of ensuring both update privacy and integrity in FL and present a new system, EIFFeL, that enables secure aggregation of verified updates. EIFFeL is a general framework that can enforce arbitrary integrity checks and remove malformed updates from the aggregate, without violating privacy. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the practicality of EIFFeL. For instance, with 100 clients and 10% poisoning, EIFFeL can train an MNIST classification model to the same accuracy as that of a non-poisoned federated learner in just 2.4s per iteration.",

        "title": "Cert-RNN: Towards Certifying the Robustness of Recurrent Neural Networks",
        "abstract": "Certifiable robustness, the functionality of verifying whether the given region surrounding a data point admits any adversarial example, provides guaranteed security for neural networks deployed in adversarial environments. A plethora of work has been proposed to certify the robustness of feed-forward networks, e.g., FCNs and CNNs. Yet, most existing methods cannot be directly applied to recurrent neural networks (RNNs), due to their sequential inputs and unique operations. In this paper, we present Cert-RNN, a general framework for certifying the robustness of RNNs. Specifically, through detailed analysis for the intrinsic property of the unique function in different ranges, we exhaustively discuss different cases for the exact formula of bounding planes, based on which we design several precise and efficient abstract transformers for the unique calculations in RNNs. Cert-RNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods (e.g., POPQORN) in terms of (i) effectiveness -- it provides much tighter robustness bounds, and (ii) efficiency -- it scales to much more complex models. Through extensive evaluation, we validate Cert-RNN's superior performance across various network architectures (e.g., vanilla RNN and LSTM) and applications (e.g., image classification, sentiment analysis, toxic comment detection, and malicious URL detection). For instance, for the RNN-2-32 model on the MNIST sequence dataset, the robustness bound certified by Cert-RNN is on average 1.86 times larger than that by POPQORN. Besides certifying the robustness of given RNNs, Cert-RNN also enables a range of practical applications including evaluating the provable effectiveness for various defenses (i.e., the defense with a larger robustness region is considered to be more robust), improving the robustness of RNNs (i.e., incorporating Cert-RNN with verified robust training) and identifying sensitive words (i.e., the word with the smallest certified robustness bound is considered to be the most sensitive word in a sentence), which helps build more robust and interpretable deep learning systems. We will open-source Cert-RNN for facilitating the DNN security research.",

        "abstract": "Current techniques to monitor botnets towards disruption or takedown are likely to result in inaccurate data gathered about the botnet or be detected by C&C orchestrators. Seeking a covert and scalable solution, we look to an evolving pattern in modern malware that integrates standardized over-permissioned protocols, exposing privileged access to C&C servers. We implement techniques to detect and exploit these protocols from over-permissioned bots toward covert C&C server monitoring. Our empirical study of 200k malware captured since 2006 revealed 62,202 over-permissioned bots (nearly 1 in 3) and 443,905 C&C monitoring capabilities, with a steady increase of over-permissioned protocol use over the last 15 years. Due to their ubiquity, we conclude that even though over-permissioned protocols allow for C&C server infiltration, the efficiency and ease of use they provide continue to make them prevalent in the malware operational landscape. This paper presents C3PO, a pipeline that enables our study and empowers incident responders to automatically identify over-permissioned protocols, infiltration vectors to spoof bot-to-C&C communication, and C&C monitoring capabilities that guide covert monitoring post infiltration. Our findings suggest the over-permissioned protocol weakness provides a scalable approach to covertly monitor C&C servers, which is a fundamental enabler of botnet disruptions and takedowns.",

        "title": "Revisiting Hybrid Private Information Retrieval",
        "abstract": "Private Information Retrieval (PIR) allows a client to request entries from a public database held by k servers without revealing any information about the requested data to the servers. PIR is classified into two classes: (i) Multi-server PIR protocols where the request is split among k\u22652 non-colluding servers, and Single-server PIR protocols where exactly k=1 server holds the database while the query is protected via certain computational hardness assumptions. Devet & Goldberg (PETS'14) showed that both can be combined into one recursive PIR protocol in order to improve the communication complexity. Their hybrid PIR protocol is instantiated with the multi-server PIR protocol of Goldberg (S&P'07) and the single-server PIR protocol by Melchar & Gaborit (WEWoRC'07), resulting in online request runtime speedups and guaranteeing at least partial privacy if the multi-server PIR servers do in fact collude. In this work we show that the hybrid PIR protocol by Devet & Goldberg still has practical relevance by designing a hybrid approach using the state-of-the-art multi-server protocol CIP-PIR (G\u00fcnther et al., ePrint'21/823) and the single-server protocol SealPIR (Angel et al., S&P'18). Our novel hybrid PIR protocol massively improves the linear communication complexity of CIP-PIR and obtains the strong property of client-independent preprocessing, which allow batch-preprocessing among multiple clients without the clients being involved. We implement and benchmark our protocol and get speedups of \u22484.36\u00d7 over the original implementation of Devet & Goldberg (8 GiB DB), speedups of \u224826.08\u00d7 (8 GiB DB) over CIP-PIR, and speedups of \u224811.16\u00d7 over SealPIR (1 GiB DB).",

        "abstract": "The ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD scheme is being increasingly widely deployed in practice. Practitioners need proven security bounds in order to set data limits and rekeying intervals for the scheme. But the formal security analysis of ChaCha20-Poly1305 currently lags behind that of AES-GCM. The only extant analysis (Procter, 2014) contains a flaw and is only for the single-user setting. We rectify this situation. We prove a multi-user security bound on the AEAD security of ChaCha20-Poly1305 and establish the tightness of each term in our bound through matching attacks. We show how our bound differs both qualitatively and quantitatively from the known bounds for AES-GCM, highlighting how subtle design choices lead to distinctive security properties. We translate our bound to the nonce-randomized setting employed in TLS 1.3 and elsewhere, and we additionally improve the corresponding security bounds for GCM. Finally, we provide a simple yet stronger variant of ChaCha20-Poly1305 that addresses the deficiencies highlighted by our analysis.",

        "abstract": "\n\n\nIn 2019, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 (Coronavirus 2019) a pandemic, many of the public managers faced tough situations in their cities due to the simultaneous loss of lives and jobs. In this regard, this study aims to propose a concise model that considers variables like the number of deaths, lethality of the virus, number of jobs and taxes collected by city halls, among others. Our study considers these issues in providing a relevant response and consistent answer to deliberations on the way forward.\n\n\n\n\nMathematical modeling was used to analyze the interaction between the agents involved and computer simulation was chosen to collect results.\n\n\n\n\n- Changing the lockdown level (fixed and variable), the results of number of death per week, total number of unemployed, cost of companies and so on are shown. \n- The results show that for the input data considered, the 0% lockdown (LD) policy is more effective for the economy and tax collection and also succeeds in repressing the effects on the number of deaths. Because of it, the comparison between with pandemic and without pandemic is provided (in percentage). \n\n\n\n\nThis study shows that implementing the lockdown did not bring expected benefits, because instead of reducing the number of deaths due to the COVID-19, individuals tend to die more from other causes. \n",

        "abstract": "Edge Computing is a new computing paradigm where applications operate at the network edge, providing low-latency services with augmented user and data privacy. A desirable goal for edge computing is pervasiveness, that is, enabling any capable and authorized entity at the edge to provide desired edge services--pervasive edge computing (PEC). However, efficient access control of users receiving services and edge servers handling user data, without sacrificing performance is a challenge. Current solutions, based on \"always-on\" authentication servers in the cloud, negate the latency benefits of services at the edge and also do not preserve user and data privacy. In this paper, we present APECS, an advanced access control framework for PEC, which allows legitimate users to utilize any available edge services without need for communication beyond the network edge. The APECS framework leverages multi-authority attribute-based encryption to create a federated authority, which delegates the authentication and authorization tasks to semi-trusted edge servers, thus eliminating the need for an \"always-on\" authentication server in the cloud. Additionally, APECS prevents access to encrypted content by unauthorized edge servers. We analyze and prove the security of APECS in the Universal Composability framework and provide experimental results on the GENI testbed to demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of APECS.",

        "abstract": "We present a highly-scalable secure computation of graph algorithms, which hides all information about the topology of the graph or other input values associated with nodes or edges. The setting is where all nodes and edges of the graph are secret-shared between multiple servers, and a secure computation protocol is run between these servers. While the method is general, we demonstrate it in a 3-server setting with an honest majority, with either semi-honest security or full security. A major technical contribution of our work is replacing the usage of secure sort protocols with secure shuffles, which are much more efficient. Full security against malicious behavior is achieved by adding an efficient verification for the shuffle operation, and computing circuits using fully secure protocols. We demonstrate the applicability of this technology by implementing two major algorithms: computing breadth-first search (BFS), which is also useful for contact tracing on private contact graphs, and computing maximal independent set (MIS). We implement both algorithms, with both semi-honest and full security, and run them within seconds on graphs of millions of elements.",

        "title": "POSTER: OS Independent Fuzz Testing of I/O Boundary",
        "abstract": "Device drivers tend to be vulnerable to errant/malicious devices because many of them assume that devices always operate correctly. If a device driver is compromised either deliberately or accidentally, this can lead to system failure or give adversaries entire system access. Therefore, testing whether device drivers can handle compromised I/O correctly is important. There are several studies on testing device drivers against I/O attacks or device failures. Previous studies, however, either require source code for testing, lack test efficiency, only support a specific OS, or only target MMIO accesses. In this paper, we present a novel testing framework of device drivers' I/O boundaries. By combining a hypervisor-based fault injection mechanism and coverage-guided fuzzing scheme, our testing framework is not only OS-independent but also efficient and can test closed-source drivers. To get the information needed to test without OS cooperation, we use IOMMU to detect DMA regions and a hardware tracing mechanism to get coverage. We describe the detailed design and the current status.",

        "title": "Frequency Estimation in the Shuffle Model with Almost a Single Message",
        "abstract": "We present a protocol in the shuffle model of differential privacy (DP) for the frequency estimation problem that achieves error \u03c9(1) \u22c5 O(log n), almost matching the central-DP accuracy, with 1 + o(1) messages per user. This exhibits a sharp transition phenomenon, as there is a lower bound of \u03a9 (n1/4) if each user is allowed to send only one message. Previously, such a result is only known when the domain size B is o(n). For a large domain, we also need an efficient method to identify the heavy hitters (i.e., elements that are frequent enough). For this purpose, we design a shuffle-DP protocol that uses o(1) messages per user and can identify all heavy hitters in time polylogarithmic in B. Finally, by combining our frequency estimation and the heavy hitter detection protocols, we show how to solve the B-dimensional 1-sparse vector summation problem in the high-dimensional setting B=\u03a9(n), achieving the optimal central-DP MSE \u00d5(n) with 1 + o(1) messages per user. In addition to error and message number, our protocols improve in terms of message size and running time as well. They are also very easy to implement. The experimental results demonstrate order-of-magnitude improvement over prior work.",

        "abstract": "Scheduler side-channels can leak critical information in real-time systems, thus posing serious threats to many safety-critical applications. The main culprit is the inherent determinism in the runtime timing behavior of such systems, e.g., the (expected) periodic behavior of critical tasks. In this paper, we introduce the notion of \"schedule indistinguishability/\", inspired by work in differential privacy, that introduces diversity into the schedules of such systems while offering analyzable security guarantees. We achieve this by adding a sufficiently large (controlled) noise to the task schedules in order to break their deterministic execution patterns. An \"epsilon-Scheduler\" then implements schedule indistinguishability in real-time Linux. We evaluate our system using two real applications: (a) an autonomous rover running on a real hardware platform (Raspberry Pi) and (b) a video streaming application that sends data across large geographic distances. Our results show that the epsilon-Scheduler offers better protection against scheduler side-channel attacks in real-time systems while still maintaining good performance and quality-of-service(QoS) requirements.",

If successful, such tools in the wrong hands will enable a range of powerful attacks against both humans and software systems (aka machines). This paper documents efforts and findings from a comprehensive experimental study on the impact of deep-learning based speech synthesis attacks on both human listeners and machines such as speaker recognition and voice-signin systems. We find that both humans and machines can be reliably fooled by synthetic speech, and that existing defenses against synthesized speech fall short.

        "abstract": "For protecting users' private data, local differential privacy (LDP) has been leveraged to provide the privacy-preserving range query, thus supporting further statistical analysis. However, existing LDP-based range query approaches are limited by their properties, ie, collecting user data according to a pre-defined structure. These static frameworks would incur excessive noise added to the aggregated data especially in the low privacy budget setting. In this work, we propose an Adaptive Hierarchical Decomposition (AHEAD) protocol, which adaptively and dynamically controls the built tree structure, so that the injected noise is well controlled for maintaining high utility. Furthermore, we derive a guideline for properly choosing parameters for AHEAD so that the overall utility can be consistently competitive while rigorously satisfying LDP. Leveraging multiple real and synthetic datasets, we extensively show the effectiveness of AHEAD in both low and high dimensional range query scenarios, as well as its advantages over the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we provide a series of useful observations for deploying \\myahead in practice.",

        "abstract": "Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the foundation of secure and trusted transactions across the Internet. Public key certificates are issued and validated by Certificate Authorities (CAs), which have their trust-of-anchor certificates in Root Program Operators' stores. These CAs provide certificates that attest to the integrity of the ownership of domain names on the web and enable secure communications. Each year hundreds of certificates are by these verified and trusted Certificate Authorities issued in error. In this research, we complied and classified certificate incident reports documented on Bugzilla, a web-based bug tracking system where such instances are reported. We focus on the 210 incident reports from the last year; we compare this pandemic period to trends from previous years. Our data show that the frequency of Certificate Authority non-compliance is a consistence source of vulnerability in the PKI ecosystem. The evaluation of reasons for the misissuance illustrate the role of one-off human failures, systematic interaction flaws leading to repeated incidents, and evidence of perverse incentives leading to misissuance.",

        "title": "A One-Pass Distributed and Private Sketch for Kernel Sums with Applications to Machine Learning at Scale",
        "abstract": "Differential privacy is a compelling privacy definition that explains the privacy-utility tradeoff via formal, provable guarantees. In machine learning, we often wish to release a function over a dataset while preserving differential privacy. Although there are general algorithms to solve this problem for any function, such methods can require hours to days to run on moderately sized datasets. As a result, most private algorithms address task-dependent functions for specific applications. In this work, we propose a general purpose private sketch, or small summary of the dataset, that supports machine learning tasks such as regression, classification, density estimation, and more. Our sketch is ideal for large-scale distributed settings because it is simple to implement, mergeable, and can be created with a one-pass streaming algorithm. At the heart of our proposal is the reduction of many machine learning objectives to kernel sums. Our sketch estimates these sums using randomized contingency tables that are indexed with locality-sensitive hashing. Existing alternatives for kernel sum estimation scale poorly, often exponentially slower with an increase in dimensions. In contrast, our sketch can quickly run on large high-dimensional datasets, such as the 65 million node Friendster graph, in a single pass that takes less than 20 minutes, which is otherwise infeasible with any known alternative. Exhaustive experiments show that the privacy-utility tradeoff of our method is competitive with existing algorithms, but at an order-of-magnitude smaller computational cost. We expect that our sketch will be practically useful for differential privacy in distributed, large-scale machine learning settings.",

        "abstract": "Domain Validation of PKI, allows to verify ownership over domains and poses the basis for cryptography. A number of recent attacks led to efforts to enhance the security of domain validation by improving the resilience of the vantage points used by the certificate authorities. In this work we measure the resilience of the domains to attacks. We show that even when the certificate authorities are secure, the domains introduce a weak link in the PKI ecosystem. Our simulations with a dataset of 2.3M popular Internet domains shows that 50% of the targets are vulnerable, allowing the network adversaries to issue fraudulent certificates even when the more secure distributed domain validation is used. Through Internet measurements we discover that the factors for such a large attack surface include the topological location of the domains, network prefix configuration of the vantage points. Importantly, our work shows that not only the vantage points have to be secure, but also the domains' resilience has to be enhanced.",

        "abstract": "We devise a simple, provably effective, and readily usable deterrence against intelligent, unknown DDoS threats: Demotivate adversaries to launch attacks via multi-hop traffic divergence. This new strategy is motivated by the fact that existing defenses almost always lag behind numerous emerging DDoS threats and evolving intelligent attack strategies. The root cause is if adversaries are smart and adaptive, no single-hop defenses (including optimal ones) can perfectly differentiate unknown DDoS and legitimate traffic. Instead, we formulate intelligent DDoS as a game between attackers and defenders, and prove how multi-hop traffic divergence helps bypass this dilemma by reversing the asymmetry between attackers and defenders. This insight results in EID, an Economical Intelligent DDoS Demotivation protocol. EID combines local weak (yet divergent) filters to provably null attack gains without knowing exploited vulnerabilities or attack strategies. It incentivizes multi-hop defenders to cooperate with boosted local service availability. EID is resilient to traffic dynamics and manipulations. It is readily deployable with random-drop filters in real networks today. Our experiments over a 49.8 TB dataset from a department at the Tsinghua campus network validate EID's viability against rational and irrational DDoS with negligible costs.",

        "abstract": "Software supply-chain attacks target components that are integrated into client applications. Such attacks often target widely-used components, with the attack taking place via operations (for example, file system or network accesses) that do not affect those aspects of component behavior that the client observes. We propose new active library learning and regeneration (ALR) techniques for inferring and regenerating the client-observable behavior of software components. Using increasingly sophisticated rounds of exploration, ALR generates inputs, provides these inputs to the component, and observes the resulting outputs to infer a model of the component's behavior as a program in a domain-specific language. We present Harp, an ALR system for string processing components. We apply Harp to successfully infer and regenerate string-processing components written in JavaScript and C/C++. Our results indicate that, in the majority of cases, Harp completes the regeneration in less than a minute, remains fully compatible with the original library, and delivers performance indistinguishable from the original library. We also demonstrate that Harp can eliminate vulnerabilities associated with libraries targeted in several highly visible security incidents, specifically event-stream, left-pad, and string-compare.",

        "abstract": "Recent research shows that, even for vulnerability reports archived by MITRE/NIST, they usually contain incomplete information about the software's vulnerable versions, making users of under-reported vulnerable versions at risk. In this work, we address this problem by introducing a fuzzing-based method. Technically, this approach first collects the crashing trace on the reference version of the software. Then, it utilizes the trace to guide the mutation of the PoC input so that the target version could follow the trace similar to the one observed on the reference version. Under the mutated input, we argue that the target version's execution could have a higher chance of triggering the bug and demonstrating the vulnerability's existence. We implement this idea as an automated tool, named VulScope. Using 30 real-world CVEs on 470 versions of software, VulScope is demonstrated to introduce no false positives and only 7.9% false negatives while migrating PoC from one version to another. Besides, we also compare our method with two representative fuzzing tools AFL and AFLGO. We find VulScope outperforms both of these existing techniques while taking the task of PoC migration. Finally, by using VulScope, we identify 330 versions of software that MITRE/NIST fails to report as vulnerable.",

        "abstract": "Kernel drivers are a critical part of the attack surface since they constitute a large fraction of kernel codebase and oftentimes lack proper vetting, especially for those closed-source ones. Unfortunately, the complex input structure and unknown relationships/dependencies among interfaces make them very challenging to understand. Thus, security analysts primarily rely on manual audit for interface recovery to generate meaningful fuzzing test cases. In this paper, we present SyzGen, a first attempt to automate the generation of syscall specifications for closed-source macOS drivers and facilitate interface-aware fuzzing. We leverage two insights to overcome the challenges of binary analysis: (1) iterative refinement of syscall knowledge and (2) extraction and extrapolation of dependencies from a small number of execution traces. We evaluated our approach on 25 targets. The results show that SyzGen can effectively produce high-quality specifications, leading to 34 bugs, including one that attackers can exploit to escalate privilege, and 2 CVEs to date.",

        "abstract": "Website fingerprinting (WFP) is a special case of traffic analysis, where a passive attacker infers information about the content of encrypted and anonymized connections by observing patterns of data flows. Although modern WFP attacks pose a serious threat to online privacy of users, including Tor users, they usually aim to detect single pages only. By ignoring the browsing behavior of users, the attacker excludes valuable information: users visit multiple pages of a single website consecutively, e.g., by following links. In this paper, we propose two novel methods that can take advantage of the consecutive visits of multiple pages to detect websites. We show that two up to three clicks within a site allow attackers to boost the accuracy by more than 20% and to dramatically increase the threat to users' privacy. We argue that WFP defenses have to consider this new dimension of the attack surface.",

        "abstract": "Two-party ECDSA signatures have received much attention due to their widespread deployment in cryptocurrencies. Depending on whether or not the message is required, we could divide two-party signing into two different phases, namely, offline and online. Ideally, the online phase should be made as lightweight as possible. At the same time, the cost of the offline phase should remain similar to that of a normal signature generation. However, the existing two-party protocols of ECDSA are not optimal: either their online phase requires decryption of a ciphertext, or their offline phase needs at least two executions of multiplicative-to-additive conversion which dominates the overall complexity. This paper proposes an online-friendly two-party ECDSA with a lightweight online phase and a single multiplicative-to-additive function in the offline phase. It is constructed by a novel design of a re-sharing of the secret key and a linear sharing of the nonce. Our scheme significantly improves previous protocols based on either oblivious transfer or homomorphic encryption. We implement our scheme and show that it outperforms prior online-friendly schemes (i.e., those have lightweight online cost) by a factor of roughly 2 to 9 in both communication and computation. Furthermore, our two-party scheme could be easily extended to the 2-out-of-n threshold ECDSA.",

        "abstract": "Embedded Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) can provide strong security for software in the IoT or in critical control systems. Approaches to combine this security with real-time and availability guarantees are currently missing. In this paper we present Aion, a configurable security architecture that provides a notion of guaranteed real-time execution for dynamically loaded enclaves. We implement preemptive multitasking and restricted atomicity on top of strong enclave software isolation and attestation. Our approach allows the hardware to enforce confidentiality and integrity protections, while a decoupled small enclaved scheduler software component can enforce availability and guarantee strict deadlines of a bounded number of protected applications, without necessarily introducing a notion of priorities amongst these applications. We implement a prototype on a light-weight TEE processor and provide a case study. Our implementation can guarantee that protected applications can handle interrupts and make progress with deterministic activation latencies, even in the presence of a strong adversary with arbitrary code execution capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Analyzing structural properties of social networks, such as identifying their clusters or finding their central nodes, has many applications. However, these applications are not supported by federated social networks that allow users to store their social contacts locally on their end devices. In the federated regime, users want access to personalized services while also keeping their social contacts private. In this paper, we take a step towards enabling analytics on federated networks with differential privacy guarantees about protecting the user's social contacts. Specifically, we present the first work to compute hierarchical cluster trees using local differential privacy. Our algorithms for computing them are novel and come with theoretical bounds on the quality of the trees learned. Empirically, our differentially private algorithms learn trees that are of comparable quality (with at most about 10% utility loss) to the trees obtained from the non-private algorithms, while having reasonable privacy (0.5 \u0142eq \u03b5 \u0142eq 2). Private hierarchical cluster trees enable new application setups where a service provider can query the community structure around a target user without having their social contacts. We show the utility of such queries by redesigning two state-of-the-art social recommendation algorithms for the federated social network setup. Our recommendation algorithms significantly outperform the baselines that do not use social contacts.",

        "abstract": "Directional data is an important class of data where the magnitudes of the data points are negligible. It naturally occurs in many real-world scenarios: For instance, geographic locations (approximately) lie on a sphere, and periodic data such as time of day, or day of week can be interpreted as points on a circle. Massive amounts of directional data are collected by location-based service platforms such as Google Maps or Foursquare, who depend on mobility data from users' smartphones or wearable devices to enable their analytics and marketing businesses. However, such data is often highly privacy-sensitive and hence demands measures to protect the privacy of the individuals whose data is collected and processed. Starting with the von Mises-Fisher distribution, we therefore propose and analyze two novel privacy mechanisms for directional data by combining directional statistics with differential privacy, which presents the current state-of-the-art for quantifying and limiting information disclosure about individuals. As we will see, our specialized privacy mechanisms achieve a better privacy-utility trade-off than ex post adaptions of established mechanisms to directional data.",

        "title": "How Does Blockchain Security Dictate Blockchain Implementation?",
        "abstract": "Blockchain protocols come with a variety of security guarantees. For example, BFT-inspired protocols such as Algorand tend to be secure in the partially synchronous setting, while longest chain protocols like Bitcoin will normally require stronger synchronicity to be secure. Another fundamental distinction, directly relevant to scalability solutions such as sharding, is whether or not a single untrusted user is able to point to certificates, which provide incontrovertible proof of block confirmation. Algorand produces such certificates, while Bitcoin does not. Are these properties accidental? Or are they inherent consequences of the paradigm of protocol design? Our aim in this paper is to understand what, fundamentally, governs the nature of security for permissionless blockchain protocols. Using the framework developed in [12], we prove general results showing that these questions relate directly to properties of the user selection process, i.e. the method (such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake) which is used to select users with the task of updating state. Our results suffice to establish, for example, that the production of certificates is impossible for proof-of-work protocols, but is automatic for standard forms of proof-of-stake protocols. As a byproduct of our work, we also define a number of security notions and identify the equivalences and inequivalences among them.",

        "title": "DetectorGuard: Provably Securing Object Detectors against Localized Patch Hiding Attacks",
        "abstract": "State-of-the-art object detectors are vulnerable to localized patch hiding attacks, where an adversary introduces a small adversarial patch to make detectors miss the detection of salient objects. The patch attacker can carry out a physical-world attack by printing and attaching an adversarial patch to the victim object; thus, it imposes a challenge for the safe deployment of object detectors. In this paper, we propose DetectorGuard as the first general framework for building provably robust object detectors against localized patch hiding attacks. DetectorGuard is inspired by recent advancements in robust image classification research; we ask: can we adapt robust image classifiers for robust object detection? Unfortunately, due to their task difference, an object detector naively adapted from a robust image classifier 1) may not necessarily be robust in the adversarial setting or 2) even maintain decent performance in the clean setting. To address these two issues and build a high-performance robust object detector, we propose an objectness explaining strategy: we adapt a robust image classifier to predict objectness (i.e., the probability of an object being present) for every image location and then explain each objectness using the bounding boxes predicted by a conventional object detector. If all objectness is well explained, we output the predictions made by the conventional object detector; otherwise, we issue an attack alert. Notably, our objectness explaining strategy enables provable robustness for \"free\": 1) in the adversarial setting, we formally prove the end-to-end robustness of DetectorGuard on certified objects, i.e., it either detects the object or triggers an alert, against any patch hiding attacker within our threat model; 2) in the clean setting, we have almost the same performance as state-of-the-art object detectors. Our evaluation on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and KITTI datasets further demonstrates that DetectorGuard achieves the first provable robustness against localized patch hiding attacks at a negligible cost (< 1%) of clean performance.",

        "abstract": "The paper focuses on developing an automated black-box testing approach called DIKEUE that checks 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) control-plane protocol implementations in commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) cellular devices (also, User Equipments or UEs) for noncompliance with the standard. Unlike prior noncompliance checking approaches which rely on property-guided testing, DIKEUE adopts a property-agnostic, differential testing approach, which leverages the existence of many different control-plane protocol implementations in COTS UEs. DIKEUE uses deviant behavior observed during differential analysis of pairwise COTS UEs as a proxy for identifying noncompliance instances. For deviant behavior identification, DIKEUE first uses black-box automata learning, specialized for 4G LTE control-plane protocols, to extract input-output finite state machine (FSM) for a given UE. It then reduces the identification of deviant behavior in two extracted FSMs as a model checking problem. We applied DIKEUE in checking noncompliance in 14 COTS UEs from 5 vendors and identified 15 new deviant behavior as well as 2 previous implementation issues. Among them, 11 are exploitable whereas 3 can cause potential interoperability issues.",

        "abstract": "If a trader could predict price changes in the stock market better than other traders, she would make a fortune. Similarly in the electricity market, a trader that could predict changes in the electricity load, and thus electricity prices, would be able to make large profits. Predicting price changes in the electricity market better than other market participants is hard, but in this paper, we show that attackers can manipulate the electricity prices in small but predictable ways, giving them a competitive advantage in the market. Our attack is possible when the adversary controls a botnet of high wattage devices such as air conditioning units, which are able to abruptly change the total demand of the power grid. Such attacks are called Manipulation of Demand via IoT (MaDIoT) attacks. In this paper, we present a new variant of MaDIoT and name it Manipulation of Market via IoT (MaMIoT). MaMIoT is the first energy market manipulation cyberattack that leverages high wattage IoT botnets to slightly change the total demand of the power grid with the aim of affecting the electricity prices in the favor of specific market players. Using real-world data obtained from two major energy markets, we show that MaMIoT can significantly increase the profit of particular market players or financially damage a group of players depending on the motivation of the attacker.",

        "abstract": "In the area of Internet of Things (IoT), voice assistants have become an important interface to operate smart speakers, smartphones, and even automobiles. To save power and protect user privacy, voice assistants send commands to the cloud only if a small set of preregistered wake-up words are detected. However, voice assistants are shown to be vulnerable to the FakeWake phenomena, whereby they are inadvertently triggered by innocent-sounding fuzzy words. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the FakeWake phenomena from three aspects. To start with, we design the first fuzzy word generator to automatically and efficiently produce fuzzy words instead of searching through a swarm of audio materials.We manage to generate 965 fuzzy words covering 8 most popular English and Chinese smart speakers. To explain the causes underlying the FakeWake phenomena, we construct an interpretable tree-based decision model, which reveals phonetic features that contribute to false acceptance of fuzzy words by wake-up word detectors. Finally, we propose remedies to mitigate the effect of FakeWake. The results show that the strengthened models are not only resilient to fuzzy words but also achieve better overall performance on original training datasets.",

        "title": "On Re-engineering the X.509 PKI with Executable Specification for Better Implementation Guarantees",
        "abstract": "The X.509 Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) standard is widely used as a scalable and flexible authentication mechanism. Flaws in X.509 implementations can make relying applications susceptible to impersonation attacks or interoperability issues. In practice, many libraries implementing X.509 have been shown to suffer from flaws that are due to noncompliance with the standard. Developing a compliant implementation is especially hindered by the design complexity, ambiguities, or under-specifications in the standard written in natural languages. In this paper, we set out to alleviate this unsatisfactory state of affairs by re-engineering and formalizing a widely used fragment of the X.509 standard specification, and then using it to develop a high-assurance implementation. Our X.509 specification re-engineering effort is guided by the principle of decoupling the syntactic requirements from the semantic requirements. For formalizing the syntactic requirements of X.509 standard, we observe that a restricted fragment of attribute grammar is sufficient. In contrast, for precisely capturing the semantic requirements imposed on the most-widely used X.509 features, we use quantifier-free first-order logic (QFFOL). Interestingly, using QFFOL results in an executable specification that can be efficiently enforced by an SMT solver. We use these and other insights to develop a high-assurance X.509 implementation named CERES. A comparison of CERES with 3 mainstream libraries (i.e., mbedTLS, OpenSSL, and GnuTLS) based on 2 million real certificate chains and 2 million synthetic certificate chains shows that CERES rightfully rejects malformed and invalid certificates.",

        "abstract": "Security misconfigurations and neglected updates commonly lead to systems being vulnerable. Especially in the context of websites, we often find pages that were forgotten, that is, they were left online after they served their purpose and never updated thereafter. In this paper, we introduce new methodology to detect such forgotten or orphaned web pages. We combine historic data from the Internet Archive with active measurements to identify pages no longer reachable via a path from the index page, yet stay accessible through their specific URL. We show the efficacy of our approach and the real-world relevance of orphaned web-pages by applying it to a sample of 100,000 domains from the Tranco Top 1M. Leveraging our methodology, we find 1,953 pages on 907 unique domains that are orphaned, some of which are 20 years old. Analyzing their security posture, we find that these pages are significantly ((p < 0.01) using (\u03c72)) more likely to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerabilities than maintained pages. In fact, orphaned pages are almost ten times as likely to suffer from XSS (19.3%) than maintained pages from a random Internet crawl (2.0%), and maintained pages of websites with some orphans are almost three times as vulnerable (5.9%). Concerning SQLi, maintained pages on websites with some orphans are almost as vulnerable (9.5%) as orphans (10.8%), and both are significantly more likely to be vulnerable than other maintained pages (2.7%). Overall, we see a clear hierarchy: Orphaned pages are the most vulnerable, followed by maintained pages on websites with orphans, with fully maintained sites being least vulnerable. We share an open source implementation of our methodology to enable the reproduction and application of our results in practice.",

        "abstract": "Allowing a device to verify the digital certificate of another device is an essential requirement and key building block of many security protocols for emerging and future IoT systems that involve device-to-device communication. However, on-device certificate verification is challenging for current devices, mainly because the certificate revocation (CR) checking step costs too much resource on IoT devices and the synchronization of CR status to devices yields a long latency. This paper presents an on-device CR checking system called TinyCR, which achieves 100% accuracy, memory and computation efficiency, low synchronization latency, and low network bandwidth, while being compatible with the current certificate standard. We design a new compact and dynamic data structure called DASS to store and query global CR status on a device in TinyCR. Our implementation shows that TinyCR only costs each device 1.7 MB of memory to track 100 million IoT certificates with 1% revocation rate. Checking the CR status of one certificate spends less than 1 microsecond on a Raspberry Pi 3. TinyCR can also be updated instantly when there are new certificates added or revoked.",

        "title": "Demons in the Shared Kernel: Abstract Resource Attacks Against OS-level Virtualization",
        "abstract": "Due to its faster start-up speed and better resource utilization efficiency, OS-level virtualization has been widely adopted and has become a fundamental technology in cloud computing. Compared to hardware virtualization, OS-level virtualization leverages the shared-kernel design to achieve high efficiency and runs multiple user-space instances (a.k.a., containers) on the shared kernel. However, in this paper, we reveal a new attack surface that is intrinsic to OS-level virtualization, affecting Linux, FreeBSD, and Fuchsia. The root cause is that the shared-kernel design in OS-level virtualization results containers in sharing thousands of kernel variables and data structures directly and indirectly. Without exploiting any kernel vulnerabilities, a non-privileged container can easily exhaust the shared kernel variables and data structure instances to cause DoS attacks against other containers. Compared with the physical resources, these kernel variables or data structure instances (termed abstract resources) are more prevalent but under-protected. To show the importance of confining abstract resources, we conduct abstract resource attacks that target different aspects of the OS kernel. The results show that attacking abstract resources is highly practical and critical. We further conduct a systematic analysis to identify vulnerable abstract resources in the Linux kernel, which successfully detects 1,010 abstract resources and 501 of them can be repeatedly consumed dynamically. We also conduct the attacking experiments in the self-deployed shared-kernel container environments on the top 4 cloud vendors. The results show that all environments are vulnerable to abstract resource attacks. We conclude that containing abstract resources is hard and give out multiple strategies for mitigating the risks.",

        "abstract": "Biometric authentication is one of the promising alternatives to standard password-based authentication offering better usability and security. In this work, we revisit the biometric authentication based on fuzzy signatures introduced by Takahashi et al. (ACNS'15, IJIS'19). These are special types of digital signatures where the secret signing key can be a ''fuzzy'' data such as user's biometrics. Compared to other cryptographically secure biometric authentications as those relying on fuzzy extractors, the fuzzy signature-based scheme provides a more attractive security guarantee. However, despite their potential values, fuzzy signatures have not attracted much attention owing to their theory-oriented presentations in all prior works. For instance, the discussion on the practical feasibility of the assumptions (such as the entropy of user biometrics), which the security of fuzzy signatures hinges on, is completely missing. In this work, we revisit fuzzy signatures and show that we can indeed efficiently and securely implement them in practice. At a high level, our contribution is threefold: (i) we provide a much simpler, more efficient, and direct construction of fuzzy signature compared to prior works; (ii) we establish novel statistical techniques to experimentally evaluate the conditions on biometrics that are required to securely instantiate fuzzy signatures; and (iii) we provide experimental results using a real-world finger-vein dataset to show that finger-veins from a single hand are sufficient to construct efficient and secure fuzzy signatures. Our performance analysis shows that in a practical scenario with 112-bits of security, the size of the signature is 1256 bytes, and the running time for signing/verification is only a few milliseconds.",

        "title": "HyperFuzzer: An Efficient Hybrid Fuzzer for Virtual CPUs",
        "abstract": "In this cloud computing era, the security of hypervisors is critical to the overall security of the cloud. In particular, the security of CPU virtualization in hypervisors is paramount because it is implemented in the most privileged CPU mode. Blackbox and graybox fuzzing are limited to finding shallow virtual CPU bugs due to its huge search space. Whitebox fuzzing can be used for systematic analysis of CPU virtualization, but existing implementations rely on slow hardware emulators to enable dynamic symbolic execution. In this paper, we present HyperFuzzer, the first efficient hybrid fuzzer for virtual CPUs. Our key observation is that a virtual CPU's execution is determined by the VM state. Based on this observation, we design a new fuzzing setup that uses complete VM states as fuzzing inputs, and a new fuzzing technique we call Nimble Symbolic Execution to enable dynamic symbolic execution for CPU virtualization running on bare metal. Specifically, it uses the hardware to log the control flow efficiently, and then reconstructs an approximate execution trace from only the control flow and the fuzzing input. The reconstructed execution trace is surprisingly sufficient for precise dynamic symbolic execution of virtual CPUs. We have built a prototype of HyperFuzzer based on Intel Processor Trace for Microsoft Hyper-V. Our experimental results show that HyperFuzzer can run thousands of tests per second, which is 3 orders of magnitude faster than using a hardware emulator. When compared with a baseline using full (control+data) execution traces, HyperFuzzer can still generate 96.8% of the test inputs generated by the baseline. HyperFuzzer has found 11 previously unknown virtual CPU bugs in the Hyper-V hypervisor, and all of them were confirmed and fixed.",

New classes (attack patterns, infrastructural resources to enable attacks, malware analysis to incorporate static analysis, and dynamic analysis of binaries) and relations have been added following a broadened scope of core competency questions. MalONT2.0 allows researchers to extensively capture all requisite classes and relations that gather semantic and syntactic characteristics of an android malware attack. This ontology forms the basis for the malware threat intelligence knowledge graph, MalKG, which we exemplify using three different, non-overlapping demonstrations. Malware features have been extracted from openCTI reports on android threat intelligence shared on the Internet and written in the form of unstructured text. Some of these sources are blogs, threat intelligence reports, tweets, and news articles. The smallest unit of information that captures malware features is written as triples comprising head and tail entities, each connected with a relation. In the poster and demonstration, we discuss MalONT2.0 and MalKG.",

        "title": "Statically Discovering High-Order Taint Style Vulnerabilities in OS Kernels",
        "abstract": "Static analysis is known to yield numerous false alarms when used in bug finding, especially for complex vulnerabilities in large code bases like the Linux kernel. One important class of such complex vulnerabilities is what we call \"high-order taint style vulnerability\", where the taint flow from the user input to the vulnerable site crosses the boundary of a single entry function invocation (i.e., syscall). Due to the large scope and high precision requirement, few have attempted to solve the problem. In this paper, we present SUTURE, a highly precise and scalable static analysis tool capable of discovering high-order vulnerabilities in OS kernels. SUTURE employs a novel summary-based high-order taint flow construction approach to efficiently enumerate the cross-entry taint flows, while incorporating multiple innovative enhancements on analysis precision that are unseen in existing tools, resulting in a highly precise inter-procedural flow-, context-, field-, index-, and opportunistically path-sensitive static taint analysis. We apply SUTURE to discover high-order taint vulnerabilities in multiple Android kernels from mainstream vendors (e.g., Google, Samsung, Huawei), the results show that SUTURE can both confirm known high-order vulnerabilities and uncover new ones. So far, SUTURE generates 79 true positive warning groups, of which 19 have been confirmed by the vendors, including a high severity vulnerability rated by Google. SUTURE also achieves a reasonable false positive rate (51.23%) perceived by users of our tool.",

        "abstract": "Garbled Circuit (GC) is the main practical 2PC technique, yet despite great interest in its performance, GC notoriously resists improvement. Essentially, we only know how to evaluate GC functions gate-by-gate using encrypted truth tables; given input labels, the GC evaluator decrypts the corresponding output label. Interactive protocols enjoy more sophisticated techniques. For example, we can expose to a party a (masked) private value. The party can then perform useful local computation and feed the resulting cleartext value back into the MPC. Such techniques are not known to work for GC. We show that it is, in fact, possible to improve GC efficiency, while keeping its round complexity, by exposing masked private values to the evaluator. %without introducing rounds of communication. Our improvements use garbled one-hot encodings of values. By using this encoding we improve a number of interesting functions, e.g., matrix multiplication, integer multiplication, field element multiplication, field inverses and AES S-Boxes, integer exponents, and more. We systematize our approach by providing a framework for designing such GC modules. Our constructions are concretely efficient. E.g., we improve binary matrix multiplication inside GC by more than 6x in terms of communication and by more than 4x in terms of WAN wall-clock time. Our improvement circumvents an important GC lower bound and may open GC to further improvement.",

        "title": "XSinator.com: From a Formal Model to the Automatic Evaluation of Cross-Site Leaks in Web Browsers",
        "abstract": "Cross-Site Leaks (XS-Leaks) describe a client-side bug that allows an attacker to collect side-channel information from a cross-origin HTTP resource. They are a significant threat to Internet privacy since simply visiting a web page may reveal if the victim is a drug addict or leak a sexual orientation. Numerous different attack vectors, as well as mitigation strategies, have been proposed, but a clear and systematic understanding of XS-Leak' root causes is still missing. Recently, Sudhodanan et al. gave a first overview of XS-Leak at NDSS 2020. We build on their work by presenting the first formal model for XS-Leaks. Our comprehensive analysis of known XS-Leaks reveals that all of them fit into this new model. With the help of this formal approach, we (1) systematically searched for new XS-Leak attack classes, (2) implemented XSinator.com, a tool to automatically evaluate if a given web browser is vulnerable to XS-Leaks, and (3) systematically evaluated mitigations for XS-Leaks. We found 14 new attack classes, evaluated the resilience of 56 different browser/OS combinations against a total of 34 XS-Leaks, and propose a completely novel methodology to mitigate XS-Leaks.",

        "title": "Earable Authentication via Acoustic Toothprint",
        "abstract": "Earables (ear wearable) are rapidly emerging as a new platform to enable a variety of personal applications. The traditional authentication methods thus become less applicable and inconvenient for earables due to their limited input interface. Earables, however, often feature rich around the head sensing capability that can be leveraged to capture new types of biometrics. In this work, we propose ToothSonic that leverages the toothprint-induced sonic effect produced by a user performing teeth gestures for user authentication. In particular, we design several representative teeth gestures that can produce effective sonic waves carrying the information of the toothprint. To reliably capture the acoustic toothprint, it leverages the occlusion effect of the ear canal and the inward-facing microphone of the earables. It then extracts multi-level acoustic features to represent the intrinsic acoustic toothprint for authentication. The key advantages of ToothSonic are that it is suitable for earables and is resistant to various spoofing attacks as the acoustic toothprint is captured via the private teeth-ear channel of the user that is unknown to others. Our preliminary studies with 20 participants show that ToothSonic achieves 97% accuracy with only three teeth gestures.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) networks are finding massive applications in mission-critical contexts. A group key is needed to encrypt and authenticate broadcast/multicast messages commonly seen in large-scale wireless networks. In this paper, we propose DroneKey, a novel drone-aided PHY-based Group-Key Generation (GKG) scheme for large-scale IoT networks. In DroneKey, a drone is dispatched to fly along random 3D trajectories and keep broadcasting standard wireless signals to refresh the group keys in the whole network. Every IoT device receives the broadcast signals from which to extract the Channel State Information (CSI) stream which captures the dynamic variations of the individual wireless channel between the IoT device and the drone. DroneKey explores a deep-learning approach to extract the hidden correlation among the CSI streams to establish a common group key. We thoroughly evaluate DroneKey with a prototype in both indoor and outdoor environments. We show that DroneKey can achieve a high key-generation rate of 89.5 bit/sec for 10 devices in contrast to 40 bit/sec in the state-of-art prior work. In addition, DroneKey is much more scalable and can support 100 devices in contrast to 10 nodes in the state-of-art prior work with comparable key-generate rates.",

        "abstract": "We introduce COINN - an efficient, accurate, and scalable framework for oblivious deep neural network (DNN) inference in the two-party setting. In our system, DNN inference is performed without revealing the client's private inputs to the server or revealing server's proprietary DNN weights to the client. To speedup the secure inference while maintaining a high accuracy, we make three interlinked innovations in the plaintext and ciphertext domains: (i) we develop a new domain-specific low-bit quantization scheme tailored for high-efficiency ciphertext computation, (ii) we construct novel techniques for increasing data re-use in secure matrix multiplication allowing us to gain significant performance boosts through factored operations, and (iii) we propose customized cryptographic protocols that complement our optimized DNNs in the ciphertext domain. By co-optimization of the aforesaid components, COINN brings an unprecedented level of efficiency to the setting of oblivious DNN inference, achieving an end-to-end runtime speedup of 4.7\u00d714.4\u00d7 over the state-of-the-art. We demonstrate the scalability of our proposed methods by optimizing complex DNNs with over 100 layers and performing oblivious inference in the Billion-operation regime for the challenging ImageNet dataset. Our framework is available at https://github.com/ACESLabUCSD/COINN.git.",

        "abstract": "Content blocking systems today exempt thousands of privacy-harming scripts. They do this because blocking these scripts breaks the Web sites that rely on them. In this paper, we address this privacy/functionality trade-off with SugarCoat, a tool that allows filter list authors to automatically patch JavaScript scripts to restrict their access to sensitive data according to a custom privacy policy. We designed SugarCoat to generate resource replacements compatible with existing content blocking tools, including uBlock Origin and the Brave Browser, and evaluate our implementation by automatically replacing scripts exempted by the 6,000+ exception rules in the popular EasyList, EasyPrivacy, and uBlock Origin filter lists. Crawling a sample of pages from the Alexa 10k, we find that SugarCoat preserves the functionality of existing pages-our replacements result in Web-compatibility properties similar to exempting scripts-while providing privacy properties most similar to blocking those scripts. SugarCoat is intended for real-world practical deployment, to protect Web users from privacy harms current tools are unable to protect against. Our design choices emphasize compatibility with existing tools, policy flexibility, and extensibility. SugarCoat is open source and is being integrated into Brave's content blocking tools: an initial set of SugarCoat-generated resource replacements are already shipping to users in the Brave Browser.",

        "title": "Graph Unlearning",
        "abstract": "Machine unlearning is a process of removing the impact of some training data from the machine learning (ML) models upon receiving removal requests. While straightforward and legitimate, retraining the ML model from scratch incurs a high computational overhead. To address this issue, a number of approximate algorithms have been proposed in the domain of image and text data, among which SISA is the state-of-the-art solution. It randomly partitions the training set into multiple shards and trains a constituent model for each shard. However, directly applying SISA to the graph data can severely damage the graph structural information, and thereby the resulting ML model utility. In this paper, we propose GraphEraser, a novel machine unlearning framework tailored to graph data. Its contributions include two novel graph partition algorithms and a learning-based aggregation method. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world graph datasets to illustrate the unlearning efficiency and model utility of GraphEraser. It achieves 2.06x (small dataset) to 35.94x (large dataset) unlearning time improvement. On the other hand, GraphEraser achieves up to 62.5% higher F1 score and our proposed learning-based aggregation method achieves up to 112% higher F1 score. https://github.com/MinChen00/Graph-Unlearning.",

        "abstract": "Smart factories, critical infrastructures, and medical devices largely rely on embedded systems that need to satisfy realtime constraints to complete crucial tasks. Recent studies and reports have revealed that many of these devices suffer from crucial vulnerabilities that can be exploited with fatal consequences. Despite the security and safety-critical role of these devices, they often do not feature state-of-the-art security mechanisms. Moreover, since realtime systems have strict timing requirements, integrating new security mechanisms is not a viable option as they often influence the device's runtime behavior. One solution is to offload security enhancements to a remote instance, the so-called remote attestation. We present RealSWATT, the first software-based remote attestation system for realtime embedded devices. Remote attestation is a powerful security service that allows a party to verify the correct functionality of an untrusted remote device. In contrast to previous remote attestation approaches for realtime systems, RealSWATT does neither require custom hardware extensions nor trusted computing components. It is designed to work within real-world IoT networks, connected through Wi-Fi. RealSWATT leverages a dedicated processor core for remote attestation and provides the required timing guarantees without hardware extensions. We implement RealSWATT on the popular ESP32 microcontroller, and we evaluate it on a real-world medical device with realtime constraints. To demonstrate its applicability, we furthermore integrate RealSWATT into a framework for off-the-shelf IoT devices and apply it to a smart plug, a smoke detector, and a smart light bulb.",

        "title": "Packet Scheduling with Optional Client Privacy",
        "abstract": "Existing network switches implement scheduling disciplines such as FIFO or deficit round robin that provide good utilization or fairness across flows, but do so at the expense of leaking a variety of information via timing side channels. To address this privacy breach, we propose a new scheduling mechanism for switches called indifferent-first scheduling (IFS). A salient aspect of IFS is that it provides privacy (a notion of strong isolation) to clients that opt-in, while preserving the (good) performance and utilization of FIFO or round robin for clients that are satisfied with the status quo. Such a hybrid scheduling mechanism addresses the main drawback of prior proposals such as time-division multiple access (TDMA) that provide strong isolation at the cost of low utilization and increased packet latency for all clients. We identify limitations of modern programmable switches which inhibit an implementation of IFS without compromising its privacy guarantees, and show that a version of IFS with full security can be implemented at line rate in the recently proposed push-in-first-out (PIFO) queuing architecture.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new privacy threat, the Invisible Infrared Shadow Attack (IRSA), which leverages the inconspicuous infrared (IR) light emitted by indoor security cameras, to reveal in-home human activities behind opaque curtains. The key observation is that the in-home IR light source can project invisible shadows on the window curtains, which can be captured by an attacker outside using an IR-capable camera. The major challenge for IRSA lies in the shadow deformation caused by a variety of environmental factors involving the IR source position and curtain shape, which distorts the body contour. A two-stage attack scheme is proposed to circumvent the challenge. Specifically, a DeShaNet model performs accurate shadow keypoint detection through multi-dimension feature fusion. Then a scene constructor maps the 2D shadow keypoints to 3D human skeletons by iteratively reproducing the on-site shadow projection process in a virtual Unity 3D environment. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that the proposed attack scheme can be successfully launched to recover 3D skeleton of the victims, even under severe shadow deformation. Finally, we propose potential defense mechanisms against the IRSA.",

        "abstract": "Amplification attacks generate an enormous flood of unwanted traffic towards a victim and are generated with the help of open, unsecured services, to which an adversary sends spoofed service requests that trigger large answer volumes to a victim. However, the actual execution of the packet flood is only one of the activities necessary for a successful attack. Adversaries need, for example, to develop attack tools, select open services to abuse, test them, and adapt the attacks if necessary, each of which can be implemented in myriad ways. Thus, to understand the entire ecosystem and how adversaries work, we need to look at the entire chain of activities. This paper analyzes adversarial techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) based on 549 honeypots deployed in 5 clouds that were rallied to participate in 13,479 attacks. Using a traffic shaping approach to prevent meaningful participation in DDoS activities while allowing short bursts of adversarial testing, we find that adversaries actively test for plausibility, packet loss, and amplification benefits of these servers, and show evidence of a 'memory' of previously exploited servers among attackers. In practice, we demonstrate that even for commonplace amplification attacks, adversaries exhibit differences in how they work.",

        "abstract": "While the end-to-end encryption properties of popular messaging schemes such as Whatsapp, Messenger, and Signal guarantee privacy for users, these properties also make it very difficult for messaging platforms to enforce any sort of content moderation. This can lead to the unchecked spread of malicious content such as misinformation on such platforms. In 2019, Tyagi et al. developed message traceback, which addresses this issue by allowing a messaging platform to recover the path of a forwarded message after a user reports it for malicious content. This paper presents an alternative to message traceback that offers more privacy to users and requires less platform-side storage. We term this approach source-tracking for encrypted messaging schemes. Source-tracking enables messaging platforms to provide the privacy guarantees expected from standard end-to-end encryption, but also helps hold the sources of malicious messages accountable: if malicious content is reported by a user, the source can be identified. We formalize security goals for source-tracking schemes and design and implement two source-tracking schemes with different security and performance tradeoffs.",

To address this, we have done a timeline analysis for 130 of the most dependent upon open source projects written in JavaScript language, hosted on GitHub to understand the nature and the lifetime of the vulnerabilities in those projects. We used a static code analyzer on 501K commits from the repositories to identify commits that introduced new vulnerabilities to the code and fixed existing vulnerabilities in the code. In 90% of the projects, we identified that a commit that fixed an existing vulnerability had introduced one or more new vulnerabilities into the code. On average, 16% of the commits intended to fix vulnerabilities have introduced one or more new vulnerabilities from the analyzed projects. We also found that 18% of the total vulnerabilities found in those projects have originated from a commit meant to fix an existing vulnerability, and 78% of those vulnerabilities could have been avoided of introduction if the developers were to use proper internal testing. Here, we demonstrate Sequza, a visualization tool to help organizations detect such instances at the earliest possible.",

        "title": "SmashEx: Smashing SGX Enclaves Using Exceptions",
        "abstract": "Exceptions are a commodity hardware functionality which is central to multi-tasking OSes as well as event-driven user applications. Normally, the OS assists the user application by lifting the semantics of exceptions received from hardware to program-friendly user signals and exception handling interfaces. However, can exception handlers work securely in user enclaves, such as those enabled by Intel SGX, where the OS is not trusted by the enclave code? In this paper, we introduce a new attack called SmashEx which exploits the OS-enclave interface for asynchronous exceptions in SGX. It demonstrates the importance of a fundamental property of safe atomic execution that is required on this interface. In the absence of atomicity, we show that asynchronous exception handling in SGX enclaves is complicated and prone to re-entrancy vulnerabilities. Our attacks do not assume any memory errors in the enclave code, side channels, or application-specific logic flaws. We concretely demonstrate exploits that cause arbitrary disclosure of enclave private memory and code-reuse (ROP) attacks in the enclave. We show reliable exploits on two widely-used SGX runtimes, Intel SGX SDK and Microsoft Open Enclave, running OpenSSL and cURL libraries respectively. We tested a total of 14 frameworks, including Intel SGX SDK and Microsoft Open Enclave, 10 of which are vulnerable. We discuss how the vulnerability manifests on both SGX1-based and SGX2-based platforms. We present potential mitigation and long-term defenses for SmashEx.",

        "abstract": "Threshold aggregation reporting systems promise a practical, privacy-preserving solution for developers to learn how their applications are used in-the-wild. Unfortunately, proposed systems to date prove impractical for wide scale adoption, suffering from a combination of requiring: i) prohibitive trust assumptions; ii) high computation costs; or iii) massive user bases. As a result, adoption of truly-private approaches has been limited to only a small number of enormous (and enormously costly) projects. In this work, we improve the state of private data collection by proposing STAR, a highly efficient, easily deployable system for providing cryptographically-enforced \u03ba-anonymity protections on user data collection. The STAR protocol is easy to implement and cheap to run, all while providing privacy properties similar to, or exceeding the current state-of-the-art. Measurements of our open-source implementation of STAR find that it is 1773x quicker, requires 62.4x less communication, and is 24x cheaper to run than the existing state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "With the wide application and deployment of cloud computing in enterprises, virtualization developers and security researchers are paying more attention to cloud computing security. The core component of cloud computing products is the hypervisor, which is also known as the virtual machine monitor (VMM) that can isolate multiple virtual machines in one host machine. However, compromising the hypervisor can lead to virtual machine escape and the elevation of privilege, allowing attackers to gain the permission of code execution in the host. Therefore, the security analysis and vulnerability detection of the hypervisor are critical for cloud computing enterprises. Importantly, virtual devices expose many interfaces to a guest user for communication, making virtual devices the most vulnerable part of a hypervisor. However, applying fuzzing to the virtual devices of a hypervisor is challenging because the data structures transferred by DMA are constructed in a nested form according to protocol specifications. Failure to understand the protocol of the virtual devices will make the fuzzing process stuck in the initial fuzzing stage, resulting in inefficient fuzzing. In this paper, we propose a new framework called V-Shuttle to conduct hypervisor fuzzing, which performs scalable and semantics-aware hypervisor fuzzing. To address the above challenges, we first design a DMA redirection mechanism to significantly reduce the manual efforts to reconstruct virtual devices' protocol structures and make the fuzzing environment setup automated and scalable. Furthermore, we put forward a new fuzzing mutation scheduling mechanism called seedpool to make the virtual device fuzzing process semantics-aware and speed up the fuzzing process to achieve high coverage. Extensive evaluation on QEMU and VirtualBox, two of the most popular hypervisor platforms among the world, shows that V-Shuttle can efficiently reproduce existing vulnerabilities and find new vulnerabilities. We further carried out a long-term fuzzing campaign in QEMU/KVM and VirtualBox with V-Shuttle. In total, we discovered 35 new bugs with 17 CVEs assigned.",

        "abstract": "Code obfuscation aims at protecting Intellectual Property and other secrets embedded into software from being retrieved. Recent works leverage advances in artificial intelligence (AI) with the hope of getting blackbox deobfuscators completely immune to standard (whitebox) protection mechanisms. While promising, this new field of AI-based, and more specifically search-based blackbox deobfuscation, is still in its infancy. In this article we deepen the state of search-based blackbox deobfuscation in three key directions: understand the current state-of-the-art, improve over it and design dedicated protection mechanisms. In particular, we define a novel generic framework for search-based blackbox deobfuscation encompassing prior work and highlighting key components; we are the first to point out that the search space underlying code deobfuscation is too unstable for simulation-based methods (e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search used in prior work) and advocate the use of robust methods such as S-metaheuristics; we propose the new optimized search-based blackbox deobfuscator Xyntia which significantly outperforms prior work in terms of success rate (especially with small time budget) while being completely immune to the most recent anti-analysis code obfuscation methods; and finally we propose two novel protections against search-based blackbox deobfuscation, allowing to counter Xyntia powerful attacks.",

        "abstract": "\n\nHydrophilic nanomaterials have been extensively exploited their applications\nin the field of hybrid water treatment membranes. However, some of the modification process\nto nanomaterials may be complicated, and the nonselective pores caused by the poor compatibility\nbetween nanoparticles and the polymer matrix impair the rejection efficiency for ultrafiltration application.\nThus, it is highly desirable to develop a kind of effective nano dopant with favorable\ncompatibility by a facile way for the preparation of ultrafiltration membranes.\n\n\n\nThe aim of this study was to fabricate a novel environmentally friendly and low-cost\nnano additive with good compatibility for the preparation of ultrafiltration membranes.\n\n\n\nHydroxyapatite nanotubes were prepared via a biomimetic process, and then SA was\ncoated on the surface of hydroxyapatite nanotubes. Subsequently, a series of hybrid ultrafiltration\nmembranes were fabricated with different amounts of modified HANTs and polyethersulfone\n(PES).\n\n\n\nExhaustive characterizations were conducted for the membranes, including hydrophilicity,\nporosity, mean pore size, morphologies and UF performance test. The highest water flux of the hybrid\nmembranes displayed 1.9 times that of the original PES membrane. Meanwhile, the hybrid\nmembrane with 0.2% hydroxyapatite nanotubes obtained elevated antifouling ability, achieving a\nflux recovery ratio of 85.6%.\n\n\n\nThe facile coating of SA endowed the nanotubes improved hydrophilicity and meanwhile\nenhanced the compatibility between PES and HANTs. This work provides a facile way in the\nconstruction of green nanofillers and promising results in the preparation of hybrid UF membranes.\n",

        "abstract": "Perceptual hashing is widely used to search or match similar images for digital forensics and cybercrime study. Unfortunately, the robustness of perceptual hashing algorithms is not well understood in these contexts. In this paper, we examine the robustness of perceptual hashing and its dependent security applications both experimentally and empirically. We first develop a series of attack algorithms to subvert perceptual hashing based image search. This is done by generating attack images that effectively enlarge the hash distance to the original image while introducing minimal visual changes. To make the attack practical, we design the attack algorithms under a black-box setting, augmented with novel designs (e.g., grayscale initialization) to improve the attack efficiency and transferability. We then evaluate our attack against the standard pHash as well as its robust variant using three different datasets. After confirming the attack effectiveness experimentally, we then empirically test against real-world reverse image search engines including TinEye, Google, Microsoft Bing, and Yandex. We find that our attack is highly successful on TinEye and Bing, and is moderately successful on Google and Yandex. Based on our findings, we discuss possible countermeasures and recommendations.",

        "title": "Learning Security Classifiers with Verified Global Robustness Properties",
        "abstract": "Many recent works have proposed methods to train classifiers with local robustness properties, which can provably eliminate classes of evasion attacks for most inputs, but not all inputs. Since data distribution shift is very common in security applications, e.g., often observed for malware detection, local robustness cannot guarantee that the property holds for unseen inputs at the time of deploying the classifier. Therefore, it is more desirable to enforce global robustness properties that hold for all inputs, which is strictly stronger than local robustness. In this paper, we present a framework and tools for training classifiers that satisfy global robustness properties. We define new notions of global robustness that are more suitable for security classifiers. We design a novel booster-fixer training framework to enforce global robustness properties. We structure our classifier as an ensemble of logic rules and design a new verifier to verify the properties. In our training algorithm, the booster increases the classifier's capacity, and the fixer enforces verified global robustness properties following counterexample guided inductive synthesis. We show that we can train classifiers to satisfy different global robustness properties for three security datasets, and even multiple properties at the same time, with modest impact on the classifier's performance. For example, we train a Twitter spam account classifier to satisfy five global robustness properties, with 5.4% decrease in true positive rate, and 0.1% increase in false positive rate, compared to a baseline XGBoost model that doesn't satisfy any property.",

        "title": "Black-box Adversarial Attacks on Commercial Speech Platforms with Minimal Information",
        "abstract": "Adversarial attacks against commercial black-box speech platforms, including cloud speech APIs and voice control devices, have received little attention until recent years. Constructing such attacks is difficult mainly due to the unique characteristics of time-domain speech signals and the much more complex architecture of acoustic systems. The current \"black-box\" attacks all heavily rely on the knowledge of prediction/confidence scores or other probability information to craft effective adversarial examples (AEs), which can be intuitively defended by service providers without returning these messages. In this paper, we take one more step forward and propose two novel adversarial attacks in more practical and rigorous scenarios. For commercial cloud speech APIs, we propose Occam, a decision-only black-box adversarial attack, where only final decisions are available to the adversary. In Occam, we formulate the decision-only AE generation as a discontinuous large-scale global optimization problem, and solve it by adaptively decomposing this complicated problem into a set of sub-problems and cooperatively optimizing each one. Our Occam is a one-size-fits-all approach, which achieves 100% success rates of attacks (SRoA) with an average SNR of 14.23dB, on a wide range of popular speech and speaker recognition APIs, including Google, Alibaba, Microsoft, Tencent, iFlytek, and Jingdong, outperforming the state-of-the-art black-box attacks. For commercial voice control devices, we propose NI-Occam, the first non-interactive physical adversarial attack, where the adversary does not need to query the oracle and has no access to its internal information and training data. We, for the first time, combine adversarial attacks with model inversion attacks, and thus generate the physically-effective audio AEs with high transferability without any interaction with target devices. Our experimental results show that NI-Occam can successfully fool Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, Google Assistant, iFlytek and Amazon Echo with an average SRoA of 52% and SNR of 9.65dB, shedding light on non-interactive physical attacks against voice control devices.",

        "abstract": "Key-value data is a naturally occurring data type that has not been thoroughly investigated in the local trust model. Existing local differentially private (LDP) solutions for computing statistics over key-value data suffer from the inherent accuracy limitations of each user adding their own noise. Multi-party computation (MPC) maintains better accuracy than LDP and similarly does not require a trusted central party. However, naively applying MPC to key-value data results in prohibitively expensive computation costs. In this work, we present selective multi-party computation, a novel approach to distributed computation that leverages DP leakage to efficiently and accurately compute statistics over key-value data. By providing each party with a view of a random subset of the data, we can capture subtractive noise. We prove that our protocol satisfies pure DP and is provably secure in the combined DP/MPC model. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that we can compute statistics over 10,000 keys in 20 seconds and can scale up to 30 servers while obtaining results for a single key in under a second.",

        "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) is on the precipice of entering mainstream entertainment with devices equipped with a multitude of sensing, tracking, and internet capabilities that can reshape the current infotainment industry such as online gaming or conferences with novel features. With VR techniques, the online gamer or conference attendances could choose to keep their identity anonymous by easily altering their appearances (i.e., avatars). However, in this study, we present ReAvatar, a novel de-anonymization attack that identifies users by their virtual avatar via a correlation in specific recorded movements. Using 3D pose estimation, we train a sophisticated machine learning model with user movement data recorded while performing a set of movements in real life and then again with their avatars. We then map correlations between these two sets of movement data using a bespoke agglomerative clustering algorithm and establish relationship between the user's virtual and real-life identity. ReAvatar achieves 89.60% accuracy in detecting a unique user among multiple avatars. The security and privacy implications of this paper will be foundational for users and researchers alike that explore the realm of virtual reality.",

        "title": "Harnessing Perceptual Adversarial Patches for Crowd Counting",
        "abstract": "Crowd counting, which has been widely adopted for estimating the number of people in safety-critical scenes, is shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples in the physical world (e.g., adversarial patches). Though harmful, adversarial examples are also valuable for evaluating and better understanding model robustness. However, existing adversarial example generation methods for crowd counting lack strong transferability among different black-box models, which limits their practicability for real-world systems. Motivated by the fact that attacking transferability is positively correlated to the model-invariant characteristics, this paper proposes the Perceptual Adversarial Patch (PAP) generation framework to tailor the adversarial perturbations for crowd counting scenes using the model-shared perceptual features. Specifically, we handcraft an adaptive crowd density weighting approach to capture the invariant scale perception features across various models and utilize the density guided attention to capture the model-shared position perception. Both of them are demonstrated to improve the attacking transferability of our adversarial patches. Extensive experiments show that our PAP could achieve state-of-the-art attacking performance in both the digital and physical world, and outperform previous proposals by large margins (at most +685.7 MAE and +699.5 MSE). Besides, we empirically demonstrate that adversarial training with our PAP can benefit the performance of vanilla models in alleviating several practical challenges in crowd counting scenarios, including generalization across datasets (up to -376.0 MAE and -354.9 MSE) and robustness towards complex backgrounds (up to -10.3 MAE and -16.4 MSE).",

        "title": "Chunk-Level Password Guessing: Towards Modeling Refined Password Composition Representations",
        "abstract": "Textual password security hinges on the guessing models adopted by attackers, in which a suitable password composition representation is an influential factor. Unfortunately, the conventional models roughly regard a password as a sequence of characters, or natural-language-based words, which are password-irrelevant. Experience shows that passwords exhibit internal and refined patterns, e.g., \"4ever, ing or 2015\", varying significantly among periods and regions. However, the refined representations and their security impacts could not be automatically understood by state-of-the-art guessing models (e.g., Markov). In this paper, we regard a password as a composition of several chunks, where a chunk is a sequence of related characters that appear together frequently, to model passwords. Based on the concept, we propose a password-specific segmentation method that can automatically split passwords into several chunks, and then build three chunk-level guessing models, adopted from Markov, Probabilistic Context-free Grammar (PCFG) and neural-network-based models. Based on the extensive evaluation with over 250 million passwords, these chunk-level models can improve their guessing efficiency by an average of 5.7%, 51.2% and 41.9%, respectively, in an offline guessing scenario, showcasing the power of a suitable password representation during attacks. By analysing these efficient attacks, we find that the presence of common chunks in a password is a stronger indicator for password vulnerability than the character class complexity. To protect users against such attacks, we develop a client-side and real-time password strength meter to estimate the passwords' resistance based on chunk-level guessing models.",

        "abstract": "Verifiability is a key requirement for electronic voting. However, the use of cryptographic techniques to achieve it usually requires specialist knowledge to understand; hence voters cannot easily assess the validity of such arguments themselves. To address this, solutions have been proposed using simple tables and checks, which require only simple verification steps with almost no cryptography. This simplicity comes at a cost: numerous verification checks must be made on the tables to ensure their correctness, raising the question whether the success of all the small verification steps entails the overall goal of end-to-end verifiability while preserving vote secrecy. Do the final results reflect the voters' will? Moreover, do the verification steps leak information about the voters' choices? In this paper, we provide mathematical foundations and an associated methodology for defining and proving verifiability and voter privacy for table-based election protocols. We apply them to three case studies: the Eperio protocol, Scantegrity, and Chaum's Random-Sample Election protocol. Our methodology helps us, in all three cases, identify previously unknown problems that allow an election authority to cheat and modify the election outcome. Furthermore, it helps us formulate and verify the corrected versions.",

        "title": "Don't Forget the Stuffing! Revisiting the Security Impact of Typo-Tolerant Password Authentication",
        "abstract": "To enhance the usability of password authentication, typo-tolerant password authentication schemes permit certain deviations in the user-supplied password, to account for common typographical errors yet still allow the user to successfully log in. In prior work, analysis by Chatterjee et al. demonstrated that typo-tolerance indeed notably improves password usability, yet (surprisingly) does not appear to significantly degrade authentication security. In practice, major web services such as Facebook have employed typo-tolerant password authentication systems. In this paper, we revisit the security impact of typo-tolerant password authentication. We observe that the existing security analysis of such systems considers only password spraying attacks. However, this threat model is incomplete, as password authentication systems must also contend with credential stuffing and tweaking attacks. Factoring in these missing attack vectors, we empirically re-evaluate the security impact of password typo-tolerance using password leak datasets, discovering a significantly larger degradation in security. To mitigate this issue, we explore machine learning classifiers that predict when a password's security is likely affected by typo-tolerance. Our resulting models offer various suitable operating points on the functionality-security tradeoff spectrum, ultimately allowing for partial deployment of typo-tolerant password authentication, preserving its functionality for many users while reducing the security risks.",

        "title": "CPscan: Detecting Bugs Caused by Code Pruning in IoT Kernels",
        "abstract": "To reduce the development costs, IoT vendors tend to construct IoT kernels by customizing the Linux kernel. Code pruning is common in this customization process. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of the Linux kernel and the lack of long-term effective maintenance, IoT vendors may mistakenly delete necessary security operations in the pruning process, which leads to various bugs such as memory leakage and NULL pointer dereference. Yet detecting bugs caused by code pruning in IoT kernels is difficult. Specifically, (1) a significant structural change makes precisely locating the deleted security operations (DSO ) difficult, and (2) inferring the security impact of a DSO is not trivial since it requires complex semantic understanding, including the developing logic and the context of the corresponding IoT kernel. In this paper, we present CPscan, a system for automatically detecting bugs caused by code pruning in IoT kernels. First, using a new graph-based approach that iteratively conducts a structure-aware basic block matching, CPscan can precisely and efficiently identify theDSOs in IoT kernels. Then, CPscan infers the security impact of a DSO by comparing the bounded use chains (where and how a variable is used within potentially influenced code segments) of the security-critical variable associated with it. Specifically, CPscan reports the deletion of a security operation as vulnerable if the bounded use chain of the associated security-critical variable remains the same before and after the deletion. This is because the unchanged uses of a security-critical variable likely need the security operation, and removing it may have security impacts. The experimental results on 28 IoT kernels from 10 popular IoT vendors show that CPscan is able to identify 3,193DSO s and detect 114 new bugs with a reasonably low false-positive rate. Many such bugs tend to have a long latent period (up to 9 years and 5 months). We believe CPscan paves a way for eliminating the bugs introduced by code pruning in IoT kernels. We will open-source CPscan to facilitate further research.",

        "abstract": "Collaborative filtering (CF) recommender systems have been extensively developed and widely deployed in various social websites, promoting products or services to the users of interest. Meanwhile, work has been attempted at poisoning attacks to CF recommender systems for distorting the recommend results to reap commercial or personal gains stealthily. While existing poisoning attacks have demonstrated their effectiveness with the offline social datasets, they are impractical when applied to the real setting on online social websites. This paper develops a novel and practical poisoning attack solution toward the CF recommender systems without knowing involved specific algorithms nor historical social data information a priori. Instead of directly attacking the unknown recommender systems, our solution performs certain operations on the social websites to collect a set of sampling data for use in constructing a surrogate model for deeply learning the inherent recommendation patterns. This surrogate model can estimate the item proximities, learned by the recommender systems. By attacking the surrogate model, the corresponding solutions (for availability and target attacks) can be directly migrated to attack the original recommender systems. Extensive experiments validate the generated surrogate model's reproductive capability and demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack upon various CF recommender algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Secure network protocols like TLS, QUIC, SSH and IPsec allow for additional padding to be used during encryption in order to hide message lengths. While it is impossible to conceal message lengths completely, without drastically degrading efficiency, such mechanisms aim at causing as much frustration as possible to the prospective attacker. However, none of the protocol specifications provide any guidance on how to select the length of this padding. Several works have highlighted how the leakage of message lengths can be exploited in attacks, but the converse problem of how to best defend against such attacks remains relatively understudied. We make this the focus of our work and present a formal treatment of length hiding security in a general setting. Prior work by Tezcan and Vaudenay suggested that sampling the padding length uniformly at random already achieves the best possible security. However we show that this is only true in the limited setting where only a single ciphertext is available to the adversary. If multiple ciphertexts are available to the adversary, then sampling the padding length according to a Gaussian distribution yields quantifiably better security for the same overhead. In fact, in this setting, uniformly random padding turns out to be among the worst possible choices. We confirm experimentally the superior performance of Gaussian padding over uniform padding in the context of the CRIME/BREACH attack.",

        "title": "DPGen: Automated Program Synthesis for Differential Privacy",
        "abstract": "Differential privacy has become a de facto standard for releasing data in a privacy-preserving way. Creating a differentially private algorithm is a process that often starts with a noise-free (non-private) algorithm. The designer then decides where to add noise, and how much of it to add. This can be a non-trivial process -- if not done carefully, the algorithm might either violate differential privacy or have low utility. In this paper, we present DPGen, a program synthesizer that takes in non-private code (without any noise) and automatically synthesizes its differentially private version (with carefully calibrated noise). Under the hood, DPGen uses novel algorithms to automatically generate a sketch program with candidate locations for noise, and then optimize privacy proof and noise scales simultaneously on the sketch program. Moreover, DPGen can synthesize sophisticated mechanisms that adaptively process queries until a specified privacy budget is exhausted. When evaluated on standard benchmarks, DPGen is able to generate differentially private mechanisms that optimize simple utility functions within 120 seconds. It is also powerful enough to synthesize adaptive privacy mechanisms.",

        "title": "Same Coverage, Less Bloat: Accelerating Binary-only Fuzzing with Coverage-preserving Coverage-guided Tracing",
        "abstract": "Coverage-guided fuzzing's aggressive, high-volume testing has helped reveal tens of thousands of software security flaws. While executing billions of test cases mandates fast code coverage tracing, the nature of binary-only targets leads to reduced tracing performance. A recent advancement in binary fuzzing performance is Coverage-guided Tracing (CGT), which brings orders-of-magnitude gains in throughput by restricting the expense of coverage tracing to only when new coverage is guaranteed. Unfortunately, CGT suits only a basic block coverage granularity---yet most fuzzers require finer-grain coverage metrics: edge coverage and hit counts. It is this limitation which prohibits nearly all of today's state-of-the-art fuzzers from attaining the performance benefits of CGT. This paper tackles the challenges of adapting CGT to fuzzing's most ubiquitous coverage metrics. We introduce and implement a suite of enhancements that expand CGT's introspection to fuzzing's most common code coverage metrics, while maintaining its orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional always-on coverage tracing. We evaluate their trade-offs with respect to fuzzing performance and effectiveness across 12 diverse real-world binaries (8 open- and 4 closed-source). On average, our coverage-preserving CGT attains near-identical speed to the present block-coverage-only CGT, UnTracer; and outperforms leading binary- and source-level coverage tracers QEMU, Dyninst, RetroWrite, and AFL-Clang by 2--24x, finding more bugs in less time.",

        "abstract": "Binder, the main mechanism for Android applications to access system services, adopts a client-server role model in its design, assuming the system service as the server and the application as the client. However, a growing number of scenarios require the system service to act as a Binder client and to send queries to a Binder server possibly instantiated by the application. Departing from this role-reversal possibility, this paper proposes the Binder Transaction Redirection (BiTRe) attacks, where the attacker induces the system service to transact with a customized Binder server and then attacks from the Binder server---an often unprotected direction. We demonstrate the scale of the attack surface by enumerating the utilizable Binder interfaces in BiTRe, and discover that the attack surface grows with the Android release version. In Android 11, more than 70% of the Binder interfaces are affected by or can be utilized in BiTRe. We prove the attacks' feasibility by (1) constructing a prototype system that can automatically generate executable programs to reach a substantial part of the attack surface, and (2) identifying a series of vulnerabilities, which are acknowledged by Google and assigned ten CVEs.",

        "abstract": "The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol is a fundamental building block for ensuring security on Internet. It provides an easy to use framework for the purposes of establishing an authenticated and secure channel between two parties that have never physically met. Nevertheless, TLS only provides a simple cryptographic functionality compared to more advanced protocols such as protocols for secure multiparty computation (MPC). In this work, we provide a framework for efficiently establishing channels for MPC over the Internet. We focus on MPC protocols in the oblivious transfer (OT) hybrid model such that it is sufficient to establish OT correlations for such a channel. We revisit and combine different notions of UC security proposed in both the MPC and authenticated key exchange settings. Through this work, we show how an OT protocol can be composed with a secure authenticator to ensure the authenticity of messages sent during the OT. In addition, we adapt and analyse non-interactive OTs based on dense key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) in the random oracle model, where the first message, i.e. public key, can be reused. These KEMs can be instantiated based on CDH, RSA and LWE and after a performance and security evaluation, it turns out that the resulting OT protocols are very competitive with the state of the art and are able to leverage existing PKIs.",

        "title": "Bolt-Dumbo Transformer: Asynchronous Consensus As Fast As the Pipelined BFT",
        "abstract": "An urgent demand of deploying BFT consensus (e.g., atomic broadcast) over the Internet is raised for implementing (permissioned) blockchain services. The deterministic synchronous protocols can be simple and fast in good network conditions, but are subject to denial-of-service (or even safety vulnerability) when synchrony assumption fails. Asynchronous protocols, on the contrary, are robust against the adversarial network, but are substantially more complicated and slower for the inherent use of randomness. Facing the issues, optimistic asynchronous atomic broadcast (Kursawe-Shoup, 2002; Ramasamy-Cachin, 2005) was proposed to improve the normal-case performance of the slow asynchronous consensus. They run a deterministic fastlane if the network condition remains good, and can fall back to a fully asynchronous protocol via a pace-synchronization mechanism (analog to view-change with asynchronous securities) if the fastlane fails. Unfortunately, existing pace-synchronization directly uses a heavy tool of asynchronous multi-valued validated Byzantine agreement (MVBA). When such fallback frequently occurs in the fluctuating wide-area network setting, the benefits of adding fastlane can be eliminated. We present Bolt-Dumbo Transformer (BDT), a generic framework for practical optimistic asynchronous atomic broadcast. At the core of BDT, we set forth a new fastlane abstraction that is simple and fast, while preparing honest parties to gracefully face potential fastlane failures caused by malicious leader or bad network. This enables a highly efficient pace-synchronization to handle fallback. The resulting design reduces a cumbersome MVBA to a variant of the conceptually simplest binary agreement only. Besides detailed security analyses, we also give concrete instantiations of our framework and implement them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BDT can enjoy both the low latency of deterministic protocols (e.g., 2-chain version of HotStuff and the robustness of state-of-the-art asynchronous protocols in practice.",

        "abstract": "Modern processors expose software to information leakage through shared microarchitectural state. One of the most severe leakage channels is cache contention, exploited by attacks referred to as PRIME+PROBE, which can infer fine-grained memory access patterns while placing only limited assumptions on attacker capabilities. In this work, we strengthen the cache contention channel with a near-optimal time resolution. We propose PRIME+SCOPE, a cross-core cache contention attack that performs back-to-back cache contention measurements that access only a single cache line. It offers a time resolution of around 70 cycles (25ns), while maintaining the wide applicability of PRIME+PROBE. To enable such a rapid measurement, we rely on the deterministic nature of modern replacement policies and their (non-)interaction across cache levels. We provide a methodology to, essentially, prepare multiple cache levels simultaneously, and apply it to Intel processors with both inclusive and non-inclusive cache hierarchies. We characterize the resolution of PRIME+SCOPE, and confirm it with a cross-core covert channel (capacity up to 3.5 Mbps, no shared memory) and an improved attack on AES T-tables. Finally, we use the properties underlying PRIME+SCOPE to bootstrap the construction of the eviction sets needed for the attack. The resulting routine outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by two orders of magnitude. Ultimately, our work shows that interference through cache contention can provide richer temporal precision than state-of-the-art attacks that directly interact with monitored memory addresses.",

        "abstract": "Representing a sparse histogram, or more generally a sparse vector, is a fundamental task in differential privacy. An ideal solution would use space close to information-theoretical lower bounds, have an error distribution that depends optimally on the desired privacy level, and allow fast random access to entries in the vector. However, existing approaches have only achieved two of these three goals. In this paper we introduce the Approximate Laplace Projection (ALP) mechanism for approximating k-sparse vectors. This mechanism is shown to simultaneously have information-theoretically optimal space (up to constant factors), fast access to vector entries, and error of the same magnitude as the Laplace-mechanism applied to dense vectors. A key new technique is a unary representation of small integers, which we show to be robust against \"randomized response'' noise. This representation is combined with hashing, in the spirit of Bloom filters, to obtain a space-efficient, differentially private representation. Our theoretical performance bounds are complemented by simulations which show that the constant factors on the main performance parameters are quite small, suggesting practicality of the technique.",

        "abstract": "To defeat Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks that threaten privacy on anonymity technologies such as Tor, defenses have been proposed and evaluated under the multi-page setting. The multi-page setting was designed as a difficult setting for the attacker and therefore gives too much of an advantage to the defense, allowing weak defenses to show success. We argue that all WF defenses should instead be evaluated under the one-page setting so that the defender needs to meet a higher standard of success. Evaluating known WF defenses under the one-page setting, we found that Decoy, Front and Tamaraw all failed to defend against WF attacks. None of these defenses were shown to be vulnerable in previous work. In Tamaraw's case, the attacker's TPR increases 13 times from 2.9% to 37% with 4.4% FPR; he can also achieve 91% TPR and 21% FPR. We also found that these attacks were able to succeed in a wide array of newly defined WF scenarios that could not be captured by the standard laboratory scenario. In response, we create the first defense that is strong enough for the one-page setting by augmenting Tamaraw with greater randomization overhead so that its anonymity sets are more evenly dispersed.",

        "title": "Can We Use Arbitrary Objects to Attack LiDAR Perception in Autonomous Driving?",
        "abstract": "As an effective way to acquire accurate information about the driving environment, LiDAR perception has been widely adopted in autonomous driving. The state-of-the-art LiDAR perception systems mainly rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) to achieve good performance. However, DNNs have been demonstrated vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although there are a few works that study adversarial attacks against LiDAR perception systems, these attacks have some limitations in feasibility, flexibility, and stealthiness when being performed in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we investigate an easier way to perform effective adversarial attacks with high flexibility and good stealthiness against LiDAR perception in autonomous driving. Specifically, we propose a novel attack framework based on which the attacker can identify a few adversarial locations in the physical space. By placing arbitrary objects with reflective surface around these locations, the attacker can easily fool the LiDAR perception systems. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed attack, and the results show that our proposed attack can achieve more than 90% success rate. In addition, our real-world study demonstrates that the proposed attack can be easily performed using only two commercial drones. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first study on the effect of adversarial locations on LiDAR perception models' behaviors, the first investigation on how to attack LiDAR perception systems using arbitrary objects with reflective surface, and the first attack against LiDAR perception systems using commercial drones in physical world. Potential defense strategies are also discussed to mitigate the proposed attacks.",

        "abstract": "Coverage-guided fuzzing is considered one of the most efficient bug-finding techniques, given its number of bugs reported. However, coverage tracing provided by existing software-based approaches, such as source instrumentation and dynamic binary translation, can incur large overhead. Hindered by the significantly lowered execution speed, it also becomes less beneficial to improve coverage feedback by incorporating additional execution states. In this paper, we propose SNAP, a customized hardware platform that implements hardware primitives to enhance the performance and precision of coverage-guided fuzzing. By sitting at the bottom of the computer stack, SNAP leverages the existing CPU pipeline and micro-architectural features to provide coverage tracing and rich execution semantics with near-zero cost regardless of source code availability. Prototyped as a synthesized RISC-V BOOM processor on FPGA, SNAP incurs a barely 3.1% tracing overhead on the SPEC benchmarks while achieving a 228x higher fuzzing throughput than the existing software-based solution. Posing only a 4.8% area and 6.5% power overhead, SNAP is highly practical and can be adopted by existing CPU architectures with minimal changes.",

        "abstract": "Security patches play an important role in defending against the security threats brought by the increasing OSS vulnerabilities. However, the collection of security patches still remains a challenging problem. Existing works mainly adopt a matching-based design that uses auxiliary information in CVE/NVD to reduce the search scope of patch commits. However, our preliminary study shows that these approaches can only cover a small part of disclosed OSS vulnerabilities (about 12%-53%) even with manual assistance. To facilitate the collection of OSS security patches, this paper proposes a ranking-based approach, named PatchScout, which ranks the code commits in the OSS code repository based on their correlations to a given vulnerability. By exploiting the broad correlations between a vulnerability and code commits, patch commits are expected to be put to front positions in the ranked results. Compared with existing works, our approach could help to locate more security patches and meet a balance between the patch coverage and the manual efforts involved. We evaluate PatchScout with 685 OSS CVEs and the results show that it helps to locate 92.70% patches with acceptable manual workload. To further demonstrate the utility of PatchScout, we perform a study on 5 popular OSS projects and 225 CVEs to understand the patch deployment practice across branches, and we obtain many new findings.",

        "abstract": "Although the use of pay-per-click mechanisms stimulates the prosperity of the mobile advertisement network, fraudulent ad clicks result in huge financial losses for advertisers. Extensive studies identify click fraud according to click/traffic patterns based on dynamic analysis. However, in this study, we identify a novel click fraud, named humanoid attack, which can circumvent existing detection schemes by generating fraudulent clicks with similar patterns to normal clicks. We implement the first tool ClickScanner to detect humanoid attacks on Android apps based on static analysis and variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) with limited knowledge of fraudulent examples. We define novel features to characterize the patterns of humanoid attacks in the apps' bytecode level. ClickScanner builds a data dependency graph (DDG) based on static analysis to extract these key features and form a feature vector. We then propose a classification model only trained on benign datasets to overcome the limited knowledge of humanoid attacks. We leverage ClickScanner to conduct the first large-scale measurement on app markets (i.e., 120,000 apps from Google Play and Huawei AppGallery) and reveal several unprecedented phenomena. First, even for the top-rated 20,000 apps, ClickScanner still identifies 157 apps as fraudulent, which shows the prevalence of humanoid attacks. Second, it is observed that the ad SDK-based attack (i.e., the fraudulent codes are in the third-party ad SDKs) is now a dominant attack approach. Third, the manner of attack is notably different across apps of various categories and popularities. Finally, we notice there are several existing variants of the humanoid attack. Additionally, our measurements demonstrate the proposed ClickScanner is accurate and time-efficient (i.e., the detection overhead is only 15.35% of those of existing schemes).",

        "title": "A Formally Verified Configuration for Hardware Security Modules in the Cloud",
        "abstract": "Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) are trusted machines that perform sensitive operations in critical ecosystems. They are usually required by law in financial and government digital services. The most important feature of an HSM is its ability to store sensitive credentials and cryptographic keys inside a tamper-resistant hardware, so that every operation is done internally through a suitable API, and such sensitive data are never exposed outside the device. HSMs are now conveniently provided in the cloud, meaning that the physical machines are remotely hosted by some provider and customers can access them through a standard API. The property of keeping sensitive data inside the device is even more important in this setting as a vulnerable application might expose the full API to an attacker. Unfortunately, in the last 20+ years a multitude of practical API-level attacks have been found and proved feasible in real devices. The latest version of PKCS#11, the most popular standard API for HSMs, does not address these issues leaving all the flaws possible. In this paper, we propose the first secure HSM configuration that does not require any restriction or modification of the PKCS#11 API and is suitable to cloud HSM solutions, where compliance to the standard API is of paramount importance. The configuration relies on a careful separation of roles among the different HSM users so that known API flaws are not exploitable by any attacker taking control of the application. We prove the correctness of the configuration by providing a formal model in the state-of-the-art Tamarin prover and we show how to implement the configuration in a real cloud HSM solution.",

        "title": "Understanding Security Issues in the NFT Ecosystem",
        "abstract": "Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have emerged as a way to collect digital art as well as an investment vehicle. Despite having been popularized only recently, NFT markets have witnessed several high-profile (and high-value) asset sales and a tremendous growth in trading volumes over the last year. Unfortunately, these marketplaces have not yet received much security scrutiny. Instead, most academic research has focused on attacks against decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and automated techniques to detect smart-contract vulnerabilities. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the market dynamics and security issues of the multi-billion dollar NFT ecosystem. In this paper, we first present a systematic overview of how the NFT ecosystem works, and we identify three major actors: marketplaces, external entities, and users. We then perform an in-depth analysis of the top 8 marketplaces (ranked by transaction volume) to discover potential issues, many of which can lead to substantial financial losses. We also collected a large amount of asset and event data pertaining to the NFTs being traded in the examined marketplaces. We automatically analyze this data to understand how the entities external to the blockchain are able to interfere with NFT markets, leading to serious consequences, and quantify the malicious trading behaviors carried out by users under the cloak of anonymity.",

        "abstract": "Dery et al. recently proposed a secure voting protocol for score-based elections, where independent talliers perform the tallying procedure. The protocol offers perfect ballot secrecy: it outputs the identity of the winner(s), but keeps all other information secret, even from the talliers. This high level of privacy, which may encourage voters to vote truthfully, and the protocol's extremely lightweight nature, make it a most adequate and powerful tool for democracies of any size. We have implemented that system and in this work we describe the system's components - election administrators, voters and talliers - and its operation. Our implementation is in Python and is open source. We view this demo as an essential step towards convincing decision makers in communities that practice score-based elections to adopt it as their election platform.",

        "abstract": "The growing complexity of our regulatory environment presents us with a hard problem: how can we determine if we are compliant with an ever-growing body of regulations? Computational legal auditing may help, as computational tools are exceptionally good at making sense of large amounts of data. In this research, we explore the possibility of creating a computational auditor that checks if mobile health (mHealth) apps satisfy federal security and privacy regulations. In doing so, we find that while it is challenging to convert open-ended, generally applicable, complicated laws into computational principles, the use of non-legal, authoritative, explanatory documents allows for computational operationalization while preserving the open-ended nature of the law. We test our auditor on 182 FDA/CE-approved mHealth apps. Our research suggests that the use of non-legal, authoritative, guidance documents may help with the creation of computational auditors, a promising tool to help us manage our ever-growing regulatory responsibilities.",

        "title": "Catching Transparent Phish: Analyzing and Detecting MITM Phishing Toolkits",
        "abstract": "For over a decade, phishing toolkits have been helping attackers automate and streamline their phishing campaigns. Man-in-the- Middle (MITM) phishing toolkits are the latest evolution in this space, where toolkits act as malicious reverse proxy servers of online services, mirroring live content to users while extracting cre- dentials and session cookies in transit. These tools further reduce the work required by attackers, automate the harvesting of 2FA- authenticated sessions, and substantially increase the believability of phishing web pages. In this paper, we present the first analysis of MITM phishing toolkits used in the wild. By analyzing and experimenting with these toolkits, we identify intrinsic network-level properties that can be used to identify them. Based on these properties, we develop a machine learning classifier that identifies the presence of such toolkits in online communications with 99.9% accuracy. We conduct a large-scale longitudinal study of MITM phishing toolkits by creating a data-collection framework that monitors and crawls suspicious URLs from public sources. Using this infrastruc- ture, we capture data on 1,220 MITM phishing websites over the course of a year. We discover that MITM phishing toolkits occupy a blind spot in phishing blocklists, with only 43.7% of domains and 18.9% of IP addresses associated with MITM phishing toolkits present on blocklists, leaving unsuspecting users vulnerable to these attacks. Our results show that our detection scheme is resilient to the cloaking mechanisms incorporated by these tools, and is able to detect previously hidden phishing content. Finally, we propose methods that online services can utilize to fingerprint requests origi- nating from these toolkits and stop phishing attempts as they occur.",

        "abstract": "Attack graphs (AG) are a popular area of research that display all the paths an attacker can exploit to penetrate a network. Existing techniques for AG generation rely heavily on expert input regarding vulnerabilities and network topology. In this work, we advocate the use of AGs that are built directly using the actions observed through intrusion alerts, without prior expert input. We have developed an unsupervised visual analytics system, called SAGE, to learn alert-driven attack graphs. We show how these AGs (i) enable forensic analysis of prior attacks, and (ii) enable proactive defense by providing relevant threat intelligence regarding attacker strategies. We believe that alert-driven AGs can play a key role in AI-enabled cyber threat intelligence as they open up new avenues for attacker strategy analysis whilst reducing analyst workload.",

        "abstract": "Timing property plays a vital role in the Cyber-Physical System(CPS) due to its interaction with the physical world. The smooth operation of these robotic systems often relies on an accurate and timely perception and actuation of the physical world. In this poster, we demonstrated a unique new class of attack, Chronos, that exploits timing interference to cause system destabilization in cyber-physical systems. Using a compromised non-privileged non-critical task on the system, we launch timing interference attacks on both drone and autonomous vehicle platforms. Through both open-loop and close-loop testing on the end-to-end stack, we showed that the timing attack could lead to complete loss of control of the autonomous system, crashing them onto the surroundings when there is no software vulnerability. To further understand this novel attack vector, we perform preliminary investigations on the localization component of these two platforms, because they both make use of well-known simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms that depend on timing-sensitive multimodal data from different sensors. Building on the insights from the case study, we present our formulation of the timing attack surface and highlight future directions.",

        "abstract": "Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is used in smart grid systems to maintain the grid's frequency to a nominal value. Cyber-attacks such as time delay and false data injection on the tie-line power flow, frequency measurements, and Area Control Error (ACE) control signals can cause frequency excursion that can trigger load shedding, generators' damage, and blackouts. Therefore, resilience and detection of attacks are of paramount importance in terms of the reliable operation of the grid. In contrast with the previous works that overlook ACE resiliency, this paper proposes an approach for cyber-attack detection and resiliency in the overall AGC process. We propose a state estimation algorithm approach for the AGC system by utilizing prior information based on Gaussian process regression, a non-parametric, Bayesian approach to regression. We evaluate our approach using the PowerWorld simulator based on the three-area New England IEEE 39-bus model. Moreover, we utilize the modified version of the New England ISO load data for the three-area power system to create a more realistic dataset. Our results clearly show that our resilient control system approach can mitigate the system using predictive control and detect the attack with a 100 percent detection rate in a shorter period using prior auxiliary information.",

        "title": "DataLens: Scalable Privacy Preserving Training via Gradient Compression and Aggregation",
        "abstract": "Recent success of deep neural networks (DNNs) hinges on the availability of large-scale dataset; however, training on such dataset often poses privacy risks for sensitive training information. In this paper, we aim to explore the power of generative models and gradient sparsity, and propose a scalable privacy-preserving generative model DataLens, which is able to generate synthetic data in a differentially private (DP) way given sensitive input data. Thus, it is possible to train models for different down-stream tasks with the generated data while protecting the private information. In particular, we leverage the generative adversarial networks (GAN) and PATE framework to train multiple discriminators as \"teacher\" models, allowing them to vote with their gradient vectors to guarantee privacy. Comparing with the standard PATE privacy preserving framework which allows teachers to vote on one-dimensional predictions, voting on the high dimensional gradient vectors is challenging in terms of privacy preservation. As dimension reduction techniques are required, we need to navigate a delicate tradeoff space between (1) the improvement of privacy preservation and (2) the slowdown of SGD convergence. To tackle this, we propose a novel dimension compression and aggregation approach TopAgg, which combines top-k dimension compression with a corresponding noise injection mechanism. We theoretically prove that the DataLens framework guarantees differential privacy for its generated data, and provide a novel analysis on its convergence to illustrate such a tradeoff on privacy and convergence rate, which requires non-trivial analysis as it requires a joint analysis on gradient compression, coordinate-wise gradient clipping, and DP mechanism. To demonstrate the practical usage of DataLens, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse datasets including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and high dimensional CelebA and Place365 datasets. We show that DataLens significantly outperforms other baseline differentially private data generative models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/AI-secure/DataLens.",

In an empirical study of all fuzzer-generated bug reports in OSSFuzz, we found that four in every five bugs have been introduced by recent code changes. That is, 77% of 23k bugs are regressions. For a newly added project, there is usually an initial burst of new reports at 2-3 bugs per day. However, after that initial burst, and after weeding out most of the existing bugs, we still get a constant rate of 3-4 bug reports per week. The constant rate can only be explained by an increasing regression rate. Indeed, the probability that a reported bug is a regression (i.e., we could identify the bug-introducing commit) increases from 20% for the first bug to 92% after a few hundred bug reports. In this paper, we introduce regression greybox fuzzing (RGF) a fuzzing approach that focuses on code that has changed more recently or more often. However, for any active software project, it is impractical to fuzz sufficiently each code commit individually. Instead, we propose to fuzz all commits simultaneously, but code present in more (recent) commits with higher priority. We observe that most code is never changed and relatively old. So, we identify means to strengthen the signal from executed code-of-interest. We also extend the concept of power schedules to the bytes of a seed and introduce Ant Colony Optimization to assign more energy to those bytes which promise to generate more interesting inputs. Our large-scale fuzzing experiment demonstrates the validity of our main hypothesis and the efficiency of regression greybox fuzzing. We conducted our experiments in a reproducible manner within Fuzzbench, an extensible fuzzer evaluation platform. Our experiments involved 3+ CPU-years worth of fuzzing campaigns and 20 bugs in 15 open-source C programs available on OSSFuzz.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning has demonstrated its strengths in numerous binary analysis tasks, including function boundary detection, binary code search, function prototype inference, value set analysis, etc. When applying deep learning to binary analysis tasks, we need to decide what input should be fed into the neural network model. More specifically, we need to answer how to represent an instruction in a fixed-length vector. The idea of automatically learning instruction representations is intriguing, but the existing schemes fail to capture the unique characteristics of disassembly. These schemes ignore the complex intra-instruction structures and mainly rely on control flow in which the contextual information is noisy and can be influenced by compiler optimizations. In this paper, we propose to pre-train an assembly language model called PalmTree for generating general-purpose instruction embeddings by conducting self-supervised training on large-scale unlabeled binary corpora. PalmTree utilizes three pre-training tasks to capture various characteristics of assembly language. These training tasks overcome the problems in existing schemes, thus can help to generate high-quality representations. We conduct both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations, and compare PalmTree with other instruction embedding schemes. PalmTree has the best performance for intrinsic metrics, and outperforms the other instruction embedding schemes for all downstream tasks.",

        "title": "Discovering IoT Physical Channel Vulnerabilities",
        "abstract": "Smart homes contain diverse sensors and actuators controlled by IoT apps that provide custom automation. Prior works showed that an adversary could exploit physical interaction vulnerabilities among apps and put the users and environment at risk, e.g., to break into a house, an adversary turns on the heater to trigger an app that opens windows when the temperature exceeds a threshold. Currently, the safe behavior of physical interactions relies on either app code analysis or dynamic analysis of device states with manually derived policies by developers. However, existing works fail to achieve sufficient breadth and fidelity to translate the app code into their physical behavior or provide incomplete security policies, causing poor accuracy and false alarms. In this paper, we introduce a new approach, IoTSeer, which efficiently combines app code analysis and dynamic analysis with new security policies to discover physical interaction vulnerabilities. IoTSeer works by first translating sensor events and actuator commands of each app into a physical execution model (PeM) and unifying PeMs to express composite physical execution of apps (CPeM). CPeM allows us to deploy IoTSeer in different smart homes by defining its execution parameters with minimal data collection. IoTSeer supports new security policies with intended/unintended physical channel labels. It then efficiently checks them on the CPeM via falsification, which addresses the undecidability of verification due to the continuous and discrete behavior of IoT devices. We evaluate IoTSeer in an actual house with 14 actuators, six sensors, and 39 apps. IoTSeer discovers 16 unique policy violations, whereas prior works identify only 2 out of 16 with 18 falsely flagged violations. IoTSeer only requires 30 mins of data collection for each actuator to set the CPeM parameters and is adaptive to newly added, removed, and relocated devices.",

        "title": "Oblivious Linear Group Actions and Applications",
        "abstract": "In this paper we propose efficient two-party protocols for obliviously applying a (possibly random) linear group action to a data set. Our protocols capture various applications such as oblivious shuffles, circular shifts, matrix multiplications, to name just a few. A notable feature enjoyed by our protocols, is that they admit a round-optimal (more precisely, one-round) online computation phase, once an input-independent off-line computation phase has been completed. Our oblivious shuffle is the first to achieve a round-optimal online phase. The most efficient instantiations of our protocols are obtained in the so-called client-aided client-server setting, where the offline phase is run by a semi-honest input party (client) who will then distribute the generated correlated randomness to the computing parties (servers). When comparing the total running time to the previous best two-party oblivious shuffle protocol by Chase et al. (Asiacrypt 2020), our shuffle protocol in this client-aided setting is up to 105 times and 152 times faster, in the LAN and WAN setting, respectively. We additionally show how the Chase et al. protocol (which is a standard two-party protocol) can be modified to leverage the advantages of the client-aided setting, but show that, even doing so, our scheme is still two times faster in the online phase and 1.34 times faster in total on average. An additional feature of our protocols is that they allow to re-invoke a previously generated group action, or its inverse, in subsequent runs. This allows us to utilize randomize-then-reveal techniques, which are crucial for constructing efficient protocols in complex applications. As an application, we construct a new oblivious sorting protocol implementing radix sort. Our protocol is based on a similar approach to the three-party protocol by Chida et al. (IACR ePrint 2019/965), but using our oblivious shuffle as a building block as well as various optimizations, we obtain a two-party protocol (in the client-aided setting) with improved online running time and a reduced number of rounds. As other applications, we also obtain efficient protocols for oblivious selection, oblivious unit-vectorization, oblivious multiplexer, oblivious polynomial evaluation, arithmetic-to-boolean share conversions, and more.",

        "abstract": "We debut the Warmonger attack, a novel attack vector that can cause denial-of-service between a serverless computing platform and an external content server. The Warmonger attack exploits the fact that a serverless computing platform shares the same set of egress IPs among all serverless functions, which belong to different users, to access an external content server. As a result, a malicious user on this platform can purposefully misbehave and cause these egress IPs to be blocked by the content server, resulting in a platform-wide denial of service. To validate the Warmonger attack, we ran months-long experiments, collected and analyzed the egress IP usage pattern of four major serverless service providers (SSPs). We also conducted an in-depth evaluation of an attacker's possible moves to inflict an external server and cause IP-blockage. We demonstrate that some SSPs use surprisingly small numbers of egress IPs (as little as only four) and share them among their users, and that the serverless platform provides sufficient leverage for a malicious user to conduct well-known misbehaviors and cause IP-blockage. Our study unveiled a potential security threat on the emerging serverless computing platform, and shed light on potential mitigation approaches.",

        "abstract": "Injection attacks have been a major threat to web applications. Despite the significant effort in thwarting injection attacks, protection against injection attacks remains challenging due to the sophisticated attacks that exploit the existing protection techniques' design and implementation flaws. In this paper, we develop Spinner, a system that provides general protection against input injection attacks, including OS/shell command, SQL, and XXE injection. Instead of focusing on detecting malicious inputs, Spinner constantly randomizes underlying subsystems so that injected inputs (e.g., commands or SQL queries) that are not properly randomized will not be executed, hence prevented. We revisit the design and implementation choices of previous randomization-based techniques and develop a more robust and practical protection against various sophisticated input injection attacks. To handle complex real-world applications, we develop a bidirectional analysis that combines forward and backward static analysis techniques to identify in-tended commands or SQL queries to ensure the correct execution of the randomized target program. We implement Spinner for the shell command processor and two different database engines(MySQL and SQLite) and in diverse programming languages including C/C++, PHP, JavaScript and Lua. Our evaluation results on 42real-world applications including 27 vulnerable ones show that it effectively prevents a variety of input injection attacks with low runtime overhead (around 5%).",

        "abstract": "Secure aggregation is a cryptographic protocol that securely computes the aggregation of its inputs. It is pivotal in keeping model updates private in federated learning. Indeed, the use of secure aggregation prevents the server from learning the value and the source of the individual model updates provided by the users, hampering inference and data attribution attacks. In this work, we show that a malicious server can easily elude secure aggregation as if the latter were not in place. We devise two different attacks capable of inferring information on individual private training datasets, independently of the number of users participating in the secure aggregation. This makes them concrete threats in large-scale, real-world federated learning applications. The attacks are generic and equally effective regardless of the secure aggregation protocol used They exploit a vulnerability of the federated learning protocol caused by incorrect usage of secure aggregation and lack of parameter validation. Our work demonstrates that current implementations of federated learning with secure aggregation offer only a ''false sense of security.''",

        "title": "Let's Downgrade Let's Encrypt",
        "abstract": "Following the recent off-path attacks against PKI, Let's Encrypt deployed in 2020 domain validation from multiple vantage points to ensure security even against the stronger on-path MitM adversaries. The idea behind such distributed domain validation is that even if the adversary can hijack traffic of some vantage points, it will not be able to intercept traffic of all the vantage points to all the nameservers in a domain. In this work we show that two central design issues of the distributed domain validation of Let's Encrypt make it vulnerable to downgrade attacks: (1) the vantage points are selected from a small fixed set of vantage points, and (2) the way the vantage points select the nameservers in target domains can be manipulated by a remote adversary. We develop off-path methodologies, based on these observations, to launch downgrade attacks against Let's Encrypt. The downgrade attacks reduce the validation with 'multiple vantage points to multiple nameservers', to validation with 'multiple vantage points to a single attacker-selected nameserver'. Through experimental evaluations with Let's Encrypt and the 1M-Let's Encrypt-certified domains, we find that our off-path attacker can successfully launch downgrade attacks against more than 24.53% of the domains, rendering Let's Encrypt to use a single nameserver for validation with them. We then develop an automated off-path attack against the 'single-server'-domain validation for these 24.53% domains, to obtain fraudulent certificates for more than 107K domains, which constitute 10% of the 1M domains in our dataset. We also evaluate our attacks against other major CAs and compare the security and efforts needed to launch the attacks, to those needed to launch the attacks against Let's Encrypt. We provide recommendations for mitigations against our attacks.",

        "abstract": "Recently, recommender systems have achieved promising performances and become one of the most widely used web applications. However, recommender systems are often trained on highly sensitive user data, thus potential data leakage from recommender systems may lead to severe privacy problems. In this paper, we make the first attempt on quantifying the privacy leakage of recommender systems through the lens of membership inference. In contrast with traditional membership inference against machine learning classifiers, our attack faces two main differences. First, our attack is on the user-level but not on the data sample-level. Second, the adversary can only observe the ordered recommended items from a recommender system instead of prediction results in the form of posterior probabilities. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel method by representing users from relevant items. Moreover, a shadow recommender is established to derive the labeled training data for training the attack model. Extensive experimental results show that our attack framework achieves a strong performance. In addition, we design a defense mechanism to effectively mitigate the membership inference threat of recommender systems.",

        "title": "Towards Transparent and Stealthy Android OS Sandboxing via Customizable Container-Based Virtualization",
        "abstract": "A fast-growing demand from smartphone users is mobile virtualization.This technique supports running separate instances of virtual phone environments on the same device. In this way, users can run multiple copies of the same app simultaneously,and they can also run an untrusted app in an isolated virtual phone without causing damages to other apps. Traditional hypervisor-based virtualization is impractical to resource-constrained mobile devices.Recent app-level virtualization efforts suffer from the weak isolation mechanism. In contrast, container-based virtualization offers an isolated virtual environment with superior performance.However, existing Android containers do not meet the anti-evasion requirement for security applications: their designs are inherently incapable of providing transparency or stealthiness. In this paper, we present VPBox, a novel Android OS-level sandbox framework via container-based virtualization. We integrate the principle of anti-virtual-machine detection into VPBox's design from two aspects.First, we improve the state-of-the-art Android container work significantly for transparency.We are the first to offer complete device virtualization on mainstream Android versions.To minimize the fingerprints of VPBox's presence, we enable all virtualization components (i.e., kernel-level device and user level device virtualization) to be executed outside of virtual phones (VPs).Second, we offer new functionality that security analysts can customize device artifacts (e.g., phone model, kernel version, and hardware profiles) without user-level hooking. This capability prevents the tested apps from detecting the particular mobile device (e.g., Google Pixel phone) that runs an Android container.Our performance evaluation on five VPs shows that VPBox runs different benchmark apps at native speed.Compared with other Android sandboxes, VPBox is the only one that can bypass a set of virtual environment detection heuristics. At last, we demonstrate VPBox's flexibility in testing environment-sensitive malware that tries to evade sandboxes.",

        "abstract": "This paper demonstrates that today's wireless charging interface is vulnerable to power side-channel attacks; a smartphone that charges wirelessly leaks information about its activity to the wireless charger transmitter. We present a website fingerprinting attack and other preliminary attacks through the wireless charging side channel on iOS and Android devices. The website fingerprinting attack monitors the current draw of a wireless charger while the smartphone it charges loads a website from the Alexa top sites list. Our classifier identifies the website loaded on an iPhone 11 or a Google Pixel 4 with over 90% accuracy using wireless charging current traces. This attack represents a considerable security threat because wireless charging will always initiate when a compatible device is within the range of a charging transmitter. We find that the performance of the attack deteriorates as the contents of websites change over time. Additionally, this study finds that the wireless charging side channel is comparable to the wired USB charging side channel. Information leakage in both interfaces heavily depends on the battery level; minimal information leaks at low battery levels.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we perform the first multifaceted measurement study to investigate the widespread insecure practices employed by tertiary education institutes (TEIs) around the globe when offering WPA2-Enterprise Wi-Fi services. The security of such services critically hinges on two aspects: (1) the connection configuration on the client-side; and (2) the TLS setup on the authentication servers. Weaknesses in either can leave users susceptible to credential theft. Typically, TEIs prescribe to their users either manual instructions or pre-configured profiles (e.g., eduroam CAT). For studying the security of configurations, we present a framework in which each configuration is mapped to an abstract security label drawn from a strict partially ordered set. We first used this framework to evaluate the configurations supported by the user interfaces (UIs) of mainstream operating systems (OSs), and discovered many design weaknesses. We then considered 7045 TEIs in 54 countries/regions, and collected 7275 configuration instructions from 2061 TEIs. Our analysis showed that majority of these instructions lead to insecure configurations, and nearly 86% of those TEIs can suffer from credential thefts on at least one OS. We also analyzed a large corpus of pre-configured eduroam CAT profiles and discovered several misconfiguration issues that can negatively impact security. Finally, we evaluated the TLS parameters used by authentication servers of thousands of TEIs and discovered perilous practices, such as the use of expired certificates, deprecated versions of TLS, weak signature algorithms, and suspected cases of private key reuse among TEIs. Our long list of findings have been responsibly disclosed to the relevant stakeholders, many of which have already been positively acknowledged.",

        "abstract": "Memory-safety issues have been a long-standing concern of the security practitioners. According to Microsoft and Google, memory-safety bugs still represent 70% of the exploited vulnerabilities in complex, real-world programs like OSes and Web browsers. However, it doesn't mean that academics and practitioners haven't tried hard to alleviate the problem. Advances in automatic techniques like fuzzing and sanitizers revolutionize the way we tame the memory safety bugs, but the increasing volume of new software simply outpaces the adoption rate of these promising new techniques, setting the legacy programs aside. In this talk, I'd like to share \"our\" own journey to fight against memory-safety bugs - \"our\" is important as all research is conducted together with the brightest hackers in SSLab at Georgia Tech. First, I'd like to talk about our group's research agenda in the memory-safety world ranging from binary exploitation, programming analysis, fuzzing, symbolic execution and security education. Second, I will share our group's journey to participate in the DARPA CGC, DEFCON CTF and pwn2own competitions. Third, I will also present where our group is heading to: a promising new memory/thread-safe language, called Rust. Lastly, I will conclude the talk with an important projection by using our recent work on finding bugs in the Rust packages: like COVID-19, the memory-safety bugs likely stay with us for the next decade, if not more.",

        "abstract": "We present Xenon, a solver-aided, interactive method for formally verifying that Verilog hardware executes in constant-time. Xenon scales to realistic hardware designs by drastically reducing the effort needed to localize the root cause of verification failures via a new notion of constant-time counterexamples, which Xenon uses to synthesize a minimal set of secrecy assumptions in an interactive verification loop. To reduce verification time Xenon exploits modularity in Verilog code via module summaries, thereby avoiding duplicate work across multiple module instantiations. We show how Xenon's assumption synthesis and summaries enable us to verify different kinds of circuits, including a highly modular AES- 256 implementation where modularity cuts verification from six hours to under three seconds, and the ScarVside-channel hardened RISC-V micro-controller whose size exceeds previously verified designs by an order of magnitude. In a small study, we also find that Xenon helps non-expert users complete verification tasks correctly and faster than previous state-of-art tools.",

        "abstract": "The existing Bitcoin security research has mainly followed the security models in [22, 35], which stipulate that an adversary controls some mining power in order to violate the blockchain consistency property (i.e., through a double-spend attack). These models, however, largely overlooked the impact of the realistic network synchronization, which can be manipulated given the permissionless nature of the network. In this paper, we revisit the security of Bitcoin blockchain by incorporating the network synchronization into the security model and evaluating that in practice. Towards this goal, we propose the ideal functionality for the Bitcoin network synchronization and specify bounds on the network outdegree and the block propagation delay in order to preserve the consistency property. By contrasting the ideal functionality against measurements, we find deteriorating network synchronization reported by Bitnodes and a notable churn rate with 10% of the nodes arriving and departing from the network daily. Motivated by these findings, we propose SyncAttack, an attack that allows an adversary to violate the Bitcoin blockchain consistency property and double-spend without using any mining power. Moreover, during our measurements, we discover weaknesses in Bitcoin that can be exploited to reduce the cost of SyncAttack, deanonymize Bitcoin transactions, and reduce the effective network hash rate. We also observe events that suggest malicious nodes are exploiting those weaknesses in the network. Finally, we patch those weaknesses to mitigate SyncAttack and associated risks.",

        "title": "Util::Lookup: Exploiting Key Decoding in Cryptographic Libraries",
        "abstract": "Implementations of cryptographic libraries have been scrutinized for secret-dependent execution behavior exploitable by microarchitectural side-channel attacks. To prevent unintended leakages, most libraries moved to constant-time implementations of cryptographic primitives. There have also been efforts to certify libraries for use in sensitive areas, like Microsoft CNG and Botan, with specific attention to leakage behavior. In this work, we show that a common oversight in these libraries is the existence of utility functions, which handle and thus possibly leak confidential information. We analyze the exploitability of base64 decoding functions across several widely used cryptographic libraries. Base64 decoding is used when loading keys stored in PEM format. We show that these functions by themselves leak sufficient information even if libraries are executed in trusted execution environments. In fact, we show that recent countermeasures to transient execution attacks such as LVI ease the exploitability of the observed faint leakages, allowing us to robustly infer sufficient information about RSA private keys with a single trace. We present a complete attack, including a broad library analysis, a high-resolution last level cache attack on SGX enclaves, and a fully parallelized implementation of the extend-and-prune approach that allows a complete key recovery at medium costs.",

        "abstract": "The Web has improved our ways of communicating, collaborating, teaching, and entertaining us and our fellow human beings. However, this cornerstone of our modern society is also one of the main targets of attacks, most prominently Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). A correctly crafted Content Security Policy (CSP) is capable of effectively mitigating the effect of those Cross-Site Scripting attacks. However, research has shown that the vast majority of all policies in the wild are trivially bypassable. To uncover the root causes behind the omnipresent misconfiguration of CSP, we conducted a qualitative study involving 12 real-world Web developers. By combining a semi-structured interview, a drawing task, and a programming task, we were able to identify the participant's misconceptions regarding the attacker model covered by CSP as well as roadblocks for secure deployment or strategies used to create a CSP.",

        "abstract": "Third-party libraries ease the development of large-scale software systems. However, libraries often execute with significantly more privilege than needed to complete their task. Such additional privilege is sometimes exploited at runtime via inputs passed to a library, even when the library itself is not actively malicious. We present Mir, a system addressing dynamic compromise by introducing a fine-grained read-write-execute (RWX) permission model at the boundaries of libraries: every field of every free variable name in the context of an imported library is governed by a permission set. To help specify the permissions given to existing code, Mir's automated inference generates default permissions by analyzing how libraries are used by their clients. Applied to over 1,000 JavaScript libraries for Node.js, Mir shows practical security (61/63 attacks mitigated), performance (2.1s for static analysis and +1.93% for dynamic enforcement), and compatibility (99.09%) characteristics---and enables a novel quantification of privilege reduction.",

        "title": "CapSpeaker: Injecting Voices to Microphones via Capacitors",
        "abstract": "Voice assistants can be manipulated by various malicious voice commands, yet existing attacks require a nearby speaker to play the attack commands. In this paper, we show that even when no speakers are available, we can play malicious commands by utilizing the capacitors inside electronic devices, i.e., we convert capacitors into speakers and call it CapSpeaker. Essentially, capacitors can emit acoustic noises due to the inverse piezoelectric effect, i.e., varying the voltage across a capacitor can make it vibrate and thus emit acoustic noises. Forcing capacitors to play malicious voice commands is challenging because (1) the frequency responses of capacitors as speakers have poor performance in the range of audible voices, and (2) we have no direct control over the voltage across capacitors to manipulate their emitting sounds. To overcome the challenges, we use a PWM-based modulation scheme to embed the malicious audio onto a high-frequency carrier, e.g., above 20 kHz, and we create malware that can induce the right voltage across the capacitors such that CapSpeaker plays the chosen malicious commands. We conducted extensive experiments with 2 LED lamps (a modified one and a commercial one) and 5 victim devices (iPhone 4s, iPad mini 5, Huawei Nova 5i, etc.). Evaluation results demonstrate that CapSpeaker is feasible at a distance up to 10.5 cm, triggering a smartphone to receive voice commands, e.g., \"open the door''.",

        "abstract": "Most modern software attacks are rooted in memory corruption vulnerabilities, which are capable of altering security-sensitive data (e.g., function pointers) to unintended values. This paper introduces a new security property, the Value Invariant Property (VIP), and HyperSpace, our prototype that enforces VIP on security-sensitive data. HyperSpace safeguards the integrity of \"data values\" instead of enforcing control/data flow, allowing for low runtime overhead, yet defeating critical attacks effectively. We implement four representative security policies including Control Flow Integrity (VIP-CFI), Code Pointer Integrity (VIP-CPI), Virtual function Table protection (VIP-VTPtr), and heap metadata protection based on HyperSpace. We evaluate HyperSpace with SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks and real-world applications (NGINX and PostgreSQL) and test how HyperSpace defeats memory corruption-based attacks, including three real-world exploits and six attacks that bypass existing defenses (COOP, heap exploits, etc.). Our experimental evaluation shows that HyperSpace successfully stops all these attacks with low runtime overhead: 0.88% and 6.18% average performance overhead for VIP-CFI and VIP-CPI, respectively, and overall approximately 13.18% memory overhead with VIP-CPI in SPEC CPU2006.",

        "abstract": "Provenance-based causal analysis of audit logs has proven to be an invaluable method of investigating system intrusions. However, it also suffers from dependency explosion, whereby long-running processes accumulate many dependencies that are hard to unravel. Execution unit partitioning addresses this by segmenting dependencies into units of work, such as isolating the events that processed a single HTTP request. Unfortunately, we discover that current designs have a semantic gap problem due to how system calls and application log messages are used to infer complex internal program states. We demonstrate how attackers can modify existing code exploits to control event partitioning, breaking links in the attack and framing innocent users. We also show how our techniques circumvent existing program and log integrity defenses. We then propose a new design for execution unit partitioning that leverages additional runtime data to yield verified partitions that resist manipulation. Our design overcomes the technical challenges of minimizing additional overhead while accurately connecting low level code instructions to high level audit events, in part with the use of commodity hardware processor tracing. We implement a prototype of our design for Linux, MARSARA, and extensively evaluate it on 14 real-world programs, targeted with expertly crafted exploits. MARSARA's verified partitions successfully capture all the attack provenances while only reintroducing 2.82% of false dependencies, in the worst case, with an average overhead of 8.7%. Using a new metric called Partitioning Attack Surface, we show that MARSARA eliminates 47,642 more repartitioning gadgets per program than integrity defenses like CFI, demonstrating our prototype's effectiveness and the novelty of the attacks it prevents.",

We design algorithms and implement them in a testbed and on well-known benchmark models for buildings and bridges. Our results show that attacks to structures equipped with semi-active and active vibration control systems can let the attacker oscillate the building or bridge at the resonance frequency, effectively generating threats to the structure and the people using it. We also implement and test the effectiveness of attack-detection systems.",

        "abstract": "\n\nResistance to the critical first line anti-tubercular drug, Pyrazinamide, is a\nsignificant obstacle to achieving the global end to tuberculosis targets. Approximately 50% of multidrug-\nresistant tuberculosis and over 90% of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis strains are also\nPyrazinamide resistant. Pyrazinamide is a pro-drug that reduces the duration of tuberculosis therapy\ntime by 9-12 months, while used as an anti-biotic in the 1st- & 2nd-line tuberculosis treatment\nregimens. Pyrazinamidase is an enzyme encoded by pncA gene, which is responsible for the amide\nhydrolysis of pyrazinamide into active pyrazinoic acid. Pyrazinoic acid can inhibit trans-translation\nby binding to ribosomal protein S1 and competing with tmRNA, the natural cofactor of ribosomal\nprotein S1. Although pncA mutations have been commonly associated with pyrazinamide resistance,\na small number of resistance cases have been associated with mutations in ribosomal protein\nS1. Ribosomal protein S1was recently identified as a possible target of pyrazinamide based on\nits binding activity to pyrazinoic acid and the capacity to inhibit trans-translation.\n\n\n\nDespite the critical role played by pyrazinamide, its mechanisms of action are not yet\nfully understood. Therefore, this study is an effort to explore the resistance mechanism toward pyrazinamide\ndrug in Mycobacterium (M.) tuberculosis.\n\n\n\nAn extensive molecular dynamics simulation was performed using the AMBER software\npackage. We mutated residues of the binding site (i.e., F307A, F310A, and R357A) in the RpsA S1\ndomain to address the drug-resistant mechanism of RpsA in complex that might be responsible for\npyrazinamide resistance.\n\n\n\nMoreover, it is challenging to collect the drug mutant to combine the complex of a protein by single-\ncrystal X-ray diffraction. Thus, the total three structures were prepared by inducing mutations\nin the wild-type protein using PyMol.\n\n\n\nThe dynamic results revealed that a mutation in the binding pocket produced pyrazinamide\nresistance due to the specificity of these residues in binding pockets, which resulted in the\nscarcity of hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interaction with pyrazinoic acid, increasing the CAdistance\nbetween the binding pocket residues as compared to wild type RpsA that led to structural\ninstability.\n\n\n\nThe overall dynamic results will provide useful information behind the drug resistance\nmechanism to manage tuberculosis and also helps in better management for future drug resistance.\n",

        "title": "Dissecting Residual APIs in Custom Android ROMs",
        "abstract": "Many classic software vulnerabilities (e.g., Heartbleed) are rooted in unused code. In this work, we aim to understand whether unused Android functionality may similarly open unnecessary attack opportunities. Our study focuses on OEM-introduced APIs, which are added and removed erratically through different device models and releases. This instability contributes to the production of bloated custom APIs, some of which may not even be used on a particular device. We call such unused APIs Residuals. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale investigation of custom Android Residuals to understand whether they may lead to access control vulnerabilities. Our investigation is driven by the intuition that it is challenging for vendor developers to ensure proper protection of Residuals. Since they are deemed unnecessary, Residuals are naturally overlooked during integration and maintenance. This is particularly exacerbated by the complexities of Android's ever-evolving access control mechanism. To facilitate the study at large, we propose a set of analysis techniques that detect and evaluate Residuals' access control enforcement. Our techniques feature a synergy between application and framework program analysis to recognize potential Residuals in specially curated ROM samples. The Residual implementations are then statically analyzed to detect potential evolution-induced access control vulnerabilities. Our study reveals that Residuals are prevalent among OEMs. More importantly, we find that their presence may even lead to security-critical vulnerabilities.",

        "title": "DNS Cache Poisoning Attack: Resurrections with Side Channels",
        "abstract": "DNS is one of the fundamental and ancient protocols on the Internet that supports many network applications and services. Unfortunately, DNS was designed without security in mind and is subject to a variety of serious attacks, one of which is the well-known DNS cache poisoning attack. Over the decades of evolution, it has proven extraordinarily challenging to retrofit strong security features into it. To date, only weaker versions of defenses based on the principle of randomization have been widely deployed, e.g., the randomization of UDP ephemeral port number, making it hard for an off-path attacker to guess the secret. However, as it has been shown recently, such randomness is subject to clever network side channel attacks, which can effectively derandomize the ephemeral port number. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of the previously overlooked attack surface, and are able to uncover even stronger side channels that have existed for over a decade in Linux kernels. The side channels affect not only Linux but also a wide range of DNS software running on top of it, including BIND, Unbound and dnsmasq. We also find about 38% of open resolvers (by frontend IPs) and 14% (by backend IPs) are vulnerable including the popular DNS services such as OpenDNS and Quad9. We have extensively validated the attack experimentally under realistic configuration and network conditions and showed that it works reliably and fast.",

        "abstract": "While privacy laws and regulations require apps and services to disclose the purposes of their data collection to the users (i.e., why do they collect my data?), the data usage in an app's actual behavior does not always comply with the purposes stated in its privacy policy. Automated techniques have been proposed to analyze apps' privacy policies and their execution behavior, but they often overlooked the purposes of the apps' data collection, use and sharing. To mitigate this oversight, we propose PurPliance, an automated system that detects the inconsistencies between the data-usage purposes stated in a natural language privacy policy and those of the actual execution behavior of an Android app. PurPliance analyzes the predicate-argument structure of policy sentences and classifies the extracted purpose clauses into a taxonomy of data purposes. Purposes of actual data usage are inferred from network data traffic. We propose a formal model to represent and verify the data usage purposes in the extracted privacy statements and data flows to detect policy contradictions in a privacy policy and flow-to-policy inconsistencies between network data flows and privacy statements. Our evaluation results of end-to-end contradiction detection have shown PurPliance to improve detection precision from 19% to 95% and recall from 10% to 50% compared to a state-of-the-art method. Our analysis of 23.1k Android apps has also shown PurPliance to detect contradictions in 18.14% of privacy policies and flow-to-policy inconsistencies in 69.66% of apps, indicating the prevalence of inconsistencies of data practices in mobile apps.",

        "abstract": "Searchable Encryption (SE) enables private queries on encrypted documents. Most existing SE schemes focus on constructing industrial-ready, practical solutions at the expense of information leakages that are considered acceptable. In particular, ShadowCrypt utilizes a cryptographic approach named ''efficiently deployable, efficiently searchable encryption'' (EDESE) that reveals the encrypted dataset and the query tokens among other information. However, recent attacks showed that such leakages can be exploited to (partially) recover the underlying keywords of query tokens under certain assumptions on the attacker's background knowledge. We continue this line of work by presenting LEAP, a new leakage-abuse attack on EDESE schemes that can accurately recover the underlying keywords of query tokens based on partially known documents and the L2 leakage as per defined by Cash et al. (CCS '15). As an auxiliary function, our attack supports document recovery in the similar setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attack on EDESE schemes that achieves keyword recovery and document recovery without error based on partially known documents and L2 leakage. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack by varying levels of attacker's background knowledge.",

        "abstract": "We propose a new approach to infer state machine models from protocol implementations. Our new tool, StateInspector, learns protocol states by using novel program analyses to combine observations of run-time memory and I/O. It requires no access to source code and only lightweight execution monitoring of the implementation under test. We demonstrate and evaluate StateInspector's effectiveness on numerous TLS and WPA/2 implementations. In the process, we show StateInspector enables deeper state discovery, increased learning efficiency, and more insight compared to existing approaches. Our method led us to discover several concerning deviations from the standards and vulnerabilities in IWD and WolfSSL, both of which were assigned CVEs.",

        "title": "Secure Multi-party Computation of Differentially Private Heavy Hitters",
        "abstract": "Private learning of top-k, i.e., the k most frequent values also called heavy hitters, is a common industry scenario: Companies want to privately learn, e.g., frequently typed new words to improve suggestions on mobile devices, often used browser settings, telemetry data of frequent crashes, heavily shared articles, etc. Real-world deployments often use local differential privacy, where distributed users share locally randomized data with an untrusted server. Central differential privacy, on the other hand, assumes access to the raw data and applies the randomization only once, on the aggregated result. These solutions either require large amounts of users for high accuracy (local model) or a trusted third party (central model).We present multi-party computation protocols HH and PEM of sketches (succinct data structures) to efficiently compute differentially private top-k: HH has running time linear in the size of the data and is applicable for very small data sets (hundreds of values), and PEM is sublinear in the data domain and provides better accuracy than HH for large data sizes. Our approaches are efficient (practical running time, requiring no output reconstruction as other sketches) and more accurate than local differential privacy even for a small number of users. In our experiments we were able to securely compute differentially private top-k in less than 10 minutes using 3 semi-honest computation parties distributed over the Internet with inputs from hundreds of users (HH) and input size that is independent of the user count (PEM, excluding count aggregation).",

        "abstract": "Android emulators today are not only acting as a debugging tool for developers but also serving the massive end-users. These end-user Android emulators have attracted millions of users due to their advantages of running mobile apps on desktops and are especially appealing for mobile game players who demand larger screens and better performance. Besides, they commonly provide some customized assistant functionalities to improve the user experience, such as keyboard mapping and app installation from the host. To implement these services, emulators inevitably introduce communication channels between host OS and Android OS (in the Virtual Machine), thus forming a unique architecture which mobile phone does not have. However, it is unknown whether this architecture brings any new security risks to emulators. This paper performed a systematic study on end-user Android emulators and discovered a series of security flaws on communication channel authentication, permission control, and open interfaces. Attackers could exploit these flaws to bypass Android security mechanisms and escalate their privileges inside emulators, ultimately invading users' privacy, such as stealing valuable game accounts and credentials. To understand the impact of our findings, we studied six popular emulators and measured their flaws. The results showed that the issues are pervasive and could cause severe security consequences. We believe our work just shows the tip of the iceberg, and further research can be done to improve the security of this ecosystem.",

        "title": "DoubleX: Statically Detecting Vulnerable Data Flows in Browser Extensions at Scale",
        "abstract": "Browser extensions are popular to enhance users' browsing experience. By design, they have access to security- and privacy-critical APIs to perform tasks that web applications cannot traditionally do. Even though web pages and extensions are isolated, they can communicate through messages. Specifically, a vulnerable extension can receive messages from another extension or web page, under the control of an attacker. Thus, these communication channels are a way for a malicious actor to elevate their privileges to the capabilities of an extension, which can lead to, e.g., universal cross-site scripting or sensitive user data exfiltration. To automatically detect such security and privacy threats in benign-but-buggy extensions, we propose our static analyzer DoubleX. DoubleX defines an Extension Dependence Graph (EDG), which abstracts extension code with control and data flows, pointer analysis, and models the message interactions within and outside of an extension. This way, we can leverage this graph to track and detect suspicious data flows between external actors and sensitive APIs in browser extensions. We evaluated DoubleX on 154,484 Chrome extensions, where it flags 278 extensions as having a suspicious data flow. Overall, we could verify that 89% of these flows can be influenced by external actors (i.e., an attacker). Based on our threat model, we subsequently demonstrate exploitability for 184 extensions. Finally, we evaluated DoubleX on a labeled vulnerable extension set, where it accurately detects almost 93% of known flaws.",

        "abstract": "OAuth protocols have been widely adopted to simplify user authentication and service authorization for third-party applications. However, little effort has been devoted to automatically checking the security of the libraries that service providers widely use. In this paper, we formalize the OAuth specifications and security best practices, and design Cerberus, an automated static analyzer, to find logical flaws and identify vulnerabilities in the implementation of OAuth service provider libraries. To efficiently detect security violations in a large codebase of service provider implementation, Cerberus employs a query-driven algorithm for answering queries about OAuth specifications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Cerberus by evaluating it on datasets of popular OAuth libraries with millions of downloads. Among these high-profile libraries, Cerberus has identified 47 vulnerabilities from ten classes of logical flaws, 24 of which were previously unknown. We got acknowledged by the developers of eight libraries and had three accepted CVEs.",

        "abstract": "In September 2019, 600 armed German cops seized the physical premise of a Bulletproof Hoster (BPH) referred to as CyberBunker 2.0. The hoster resided in a decommissioned NATO bunker and advertised to host everything but child porn and anything related to terrorism while keeping servers online no matter what. While the anatomy, economics and interconnection-level characteristics of BPHs are studied, their traffic characteristics are unknown. In this poster, we present the first analysis of domains, web pages, and traffic captured at a major tier-1 ISP and a large IXP at the time when the CyberBunker was in operation. Our study sheds light on traffic characteristics of a BPH in operation. We show that a traditional BGP-based BPH identification approach cannot detect the CyberBunker, but find characteristics from a domain and traffic perspective that can add to future identification approaches.",

        "title": "Learning to Explore Paths for Symbolic Execution",
        "abstract": "Symbolic execution is a powerful technique that can generate tests steering program execution into desired paths. However, the scalability of symbolic execution is often limited by path explosion, i.e., the number of symbolic states representing the paths under exploration quickly explodes as execution goes on. Therefore, the effectiveness of symbolic execution engines hinges on the ability to select and explore the right symbolic states. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based strategy, called Learch, able to effectively select promising states for symbolic execution to tackle the path explosion problem. Learch directly estimates the contribution of each state towards the goal of maximizing coverage within a time budget, as opposed to relying on manually crafted heuristics based on simple statistics as a crude proxy for the objective. Moreover, Learch leverages existing heuristics in training data generation and feature extraction, and can thus benefit from any new expert-designed heuristics. We instantiated Learch in KLEE, a widely adopted symbolic execution engine. We evaluated Learch on a diverse set of programs, showing that Learch is practically effective: it covers more code and detects more security violations than existing manual heuristics, as well as combinations of those heuristics. We also show that using tests generated by Learch as initial fuzzing seeds enables the popular fuzzer AFL to find more paths and security violations.",

        "abstract": "It is known that deep neural networks, trained for the classification of non-sensitive target attributes, can reveal sensitive attributes of their input data through internal representations extracted by the classifier. We take a step forward and show that deep classifiers can be trained to secretly encode a sensitive attribute of their input data into the classifier's outputs for the target attribute, at inference time. Our proposed attack works even if users have a full white-box view of the classifier, can keep all internal representations hidden, and only release the classifier's estimations for the target attribute. We introduce an information-theoretical formulation for such attacks and present efficient empirical implementations for training honest-but-curious (HBC) classifiers: classifiers that can be accurate in predicting their target attribute, but can also exploit their outputs to secretly encode a sensitive attribute. Our work highlights a vulnerability that can be exploited by malicious machine learning service providers to attack their user's privacy in several seemingly safe scenarios; such as encrypted inferences, computations at the edge, or private knowledge distillation. Experimental results on several attributes in two face-image datasets show that a semi-trusted server can train classifiers that are not only perfectly honest but also accurately curious. We conclude by showing the difficulties in distinguishing between standard and HBC classifiers, discussing challenges in defending against this vulnerability of deep classifiers, and enumerating related open directions for future studies.",

        "abstract": "Despite being primarily developed for spectrum management, sharing, and enforcement in civilian and military applications, modulation classification can be exploited by an adversary to threaten user privacy (e.g., via traffic analysis), or launch jamming and spoofing attacks. Several existing works study how an adversary can still classify the user traffic despite obfuscation techniques at upper layers, but little work has been done on how an adversary can classify the \"modulation scheme'' when it is obfuscated at the physical layer. In this respect, we aim to study how to break the state-of-the-art modulation obfuscation schemes by applying various machine learning (ML) methods. Our preliminary results show that common ML techniques perform poorly in correctly classifying an obfuscated modulation scheme except for the random forest method (with a score as much as twice the other techniques we consider), providing insights on why other techniques, e.g., deep learning, might be more promising for finding underlying correlations.",

        "title": "ZKCPlus: Optimized Fair-exchange Protocol Supporting Practical and Flexible Data Exchange",
        "abstract": "Devising a fair-exchange protocol for digital goods has been an appealing line of research in the past decades. The Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payment (ZKCP) protocol first achieves fair exchange in a trustless manner with the aid of the Bitcoin network and zero-knowledge proofs. However, it incurs setup issues and substantial proving overhead, and has difficulties handling complicated validation of large-scale data. In this paper, we propose an improved solution ZKCPlus for practical and flexible fair exchange. ZKCPlus incorporates a new commit-and-prove non-interactive zero-knowledge (CP-NIZK) argument of knowledge under standard discrete logarithmic assumption, which is prover-efficient for data-parallel computations. With this argument we avoid the setup issues of ZKCP and reduce seller's proving overhead, more importantly enable the protocol to handle complicated data validations. We have implemented a prototype of ZKCPlus and built several applications atop it. We rework a ZKCP's classic application of trading sudoku solutions, and ZKCPlus achieves 21-67 times improvement in seller efficiency than ZKCP, with only milliseconds of setup time and 1 MB public parameters. In particular, our CP-NIZK argument shows an order of magnitude higher proving efficiency than the zkSNARK adopted by ZKCP. We also built a realistic application of trading trained CNN models. For a 3-layer CNN containing 8,620 parameters, it takes less than 1 second to prove and verify an inference computation, and also about 1 second to deliver the parameters, which is very promising for practical use.",

        "abstract": "Google Search is where most developers start their Web journey looking for code examples to reuse. It is highly likely that code that is linked to the top results will be among those candidates that find their way into production software. However, as a large amount of secure and insecure code has been identified on the Web, the question arises how the providing webpages are ranked by Google and whether the ranking has an effect on software security. We investigate how secure and insecure cryptographic code examples from Stack Overflow are ranked by Google Search. Our results show that insecure code ends up in the top results and is clicked on more often. There is at least a 22.8% chance that one out of the top three Google Search results leads to insecure code. We introduce security-based re-ranking, where the rank of Google Search is updated based on the security and relevance of the provided source code in the results. We tested our re-ranking approach and compared it to Google's original ranking in an online developer study. Participants that used our modified search engine to look for help online submitted more secure and functional results, with statistical significance. In contrast to prior work on helping developers to write secure code, security-based re-ranking completely eradicates the requirement for any action performed by developers. Our intervention remains completely invisible, and therefore the probability of adoption is greatly increased. We believe security-based re-ranking allows Internet-wide improvement of code security and prevents the far-reaching spread of insecure code found on the Web.",

        "title": "Study of thermal conductivity in two-dimensional Bi2Te3 from micro-Raman spectroscopy",
        "abstract": "Background: Topological insulator (TI), Bi2Te3 is a new class of quantum materials. Having ultralow dissipation surface states, TIs hold great promise toward different potential applications. Micro-Raman spectroscopy is a conventional and non-destructive technique, which has been widely used to characterize the structural and electronic properties of thermoelectric materials. Objective: The objective of this study is to review power dependent and temperature dependent Raman spectra of Bi2Te3 nanoflakes on SiO2/Si substrate to estimate the temperature coefficient and thermal conductivity of these flakes for possible application of this material in thermoelectrics. Method: Bi2Te3 flakes of different thicknesses were mechanically exfoliated from high-quality bulk Bi2Te3 crystal using scotch tape on 300 nm SiO2/ Si substrates. The power dependent and temperature dependent Raman spectra were acquired with the help of HORIBA LabRAM confocal microRaman system in a backscattering geometry. Results: The observed power dependent and temperature dependent Raman spectra of Bi2Te3 nanoflakes follow the same trend as discussed in various pieces of literature. From temperature coefficient and power coefficient values, the in-plane thermal conductivity has been estimated, which is found to be in the order of 10 W/m-K. The enhancement in the thermal conductivity suggests that the underlying substrate significantly affects the heat dissipation of the Bi2Te3 flake based on the coupling strength with Bi2Te3. Conclusion: This work provides a good platform to understand the role of the substrate on the thermal conductivity of exfoliated Bi2Te3 nanoflakes and this study can be extended to other substrates.

        "title": "Themis: Ambiguity-Aware Network Intrusion Detection based on Symbolic Model Comparison",
        "abstract": "Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) can be evaded by carefully crafted packets that exploit implementation-level discrepancies between how they are processed on the NIDS and at the endhosts. These discrepancies arise due to the plethora of endhost implementations and evolutions thereof. It is prohibitive to proactively employ a large set of implementations at the NIDS and check incoming packets against all of those. Hence, NIDS typically choose simplified implementations that attempt to approximate and generalize across the different endhost implementations. Unfortunately, this solution is fundamentally flawed since such approximations are bound to have discrepancies with some endhost implementations. In this paper, we develop a lightweight system Themis, which empowers the NIDS in identifying these discrepancies and reactively forking its connection states when any packets with \"ambiguities\" are encountered. Specifically, Themis incorporates an offline phase in which it extracts models from various popular implementations using symbolic execution. During runtime, it maintains a nondeterministic finite automaton to keep track of the states for each possible implementation. Our extensive evaluations show that Themis is extremely effective and can detect all evasion attacks known to date, while consuming extremely low overhead. En route, we also discovered multiple previously unknown discrepancies that can be exploited to bypass current NIDS.",

        "title": "Structural Attack against Graph Based Android Malware Detection",
        "abstract": "Malware detection techniques achieve great success with deeper insight into the semantics of malware. Among existing detection techniques, function call graph (FCG) based methods achieve promising performance due to their prominent representations of malware's functionalities. Meanwhile, recent adversarial attacks not only perturb feature vectors to deceive classifiers (i.e., feature-space attacks) but also investigate how to generate real evasive malware (i.e., problem-space attacks). However, existing problem-space attacks are limited due to their inconsistent transformations between feature space and problem space. In this paper, we propose the first structural attack against graph-based Android malware detection techniques, which addresses the inverse-transformation problem [1] between feature-space attacks and problem-space attacks. We design a Heuristic optimization model integrated with Reinforcement learning framework to optimize our structural ATtack (HRAT). HRAT includes four types of graph modifications (i.e., inserting and deleting nodes, adding edges and rewiring) that correspond to four manipulations on apps (i.e., inserting and deleting methods, adding call relation, rewiring). Through extensive experiments on over 30k Android apps, HRAT demonstrates outstanding attack performance on both feature space (over 90% attack success rate) and problem space (up to 100% attack success rate in most cases). Besides, the experiment results show that combing multiple attack behaviors strategically makes the attack more effective and efficient.",

For checking non-compliance, Morpheus adaptively generates interesting test cases and then takes advantage of an oracle, a formally proven correct implementation of PKCS#1-v1.5 signature standard, to detect non-compliance in an implementation under test. We have used Morpheus to test 45 implementations of PKCS#1-v1.5 signature verification and discovered that 6 of them are susceptible to variants of the Bleichenbacher-style low public exponent RSA signature forgery attack, 1 implementation has a buffer overflow, 33 implementations have incompatibility issues, and 8 implementations have minor leniencies. Our findings have been responsibly disclosed and positively acknowledged by the developers.",

        "title": "This Sneaky Piggy Went to the Android Ad Market: Misusing Mobile Sensors for Stealthy Data Exfiltration",
        "abstract": "Mobile sensors have transformed how users interact with modern smartphones and enhance their overall experience. However, the absence of sufficient access control for protecting these sensors enables a plethora of threats. As prior work has shown, malicious apps and sites can deploy a wide range of attacks that use data captured from sensors. Unfortunately, as we demonstrate, in the modern app ecosystem where most apps fetch and render third-party web content, attackers can use ads for delivering attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack vector that misuses the advertising ecosystem for delivering sophisticated and stealthy attacks that leverage mobile sensors. These attacks do not depend on any special app permissions or specific user actions, and affect all Android apps that contain in-app advertisements due to the improper access control of sensor data in WebView. We outline how motion sensor data can be used to infer users' sensitive touch input (e.g., credit card information) in two distinct attack scenarios, namely intra-app and inter-app data exfiltration. While the former targets the app displaying the ad, the latter affects every other Android app running on the device. To make matters worse, we have uncovered serious flaws in Android's app isolation, life cycle management, and access control mechanisms that enable persistent data exfiltration even after the app showing the ad is moved to the background or terminated by the user. Furthermore, as in-app ads can \"piggyback\" on the permissions intended for the app's core functionality, they can also obtain information from protected sensors such as the camera, microphone and GPS. To provide a comprehensive assessment of this emerging threat, we conduct a large-scale, end-to-end, dynamic analysis of ads shown in apps available in the official Android Play Store. Our study reveals that ads in the wild are already accessing and leaking data obtained from motion sensors, thus highlighting the need for stricter access control policies and isolation mechanisms.",

        "title": "SoFi: Reflection-Augmented Fuzzing for JavaScript Engines",
        "abstract": "JavaScript engines have been shown prone to security vulnerabilities, which can lead to serious consequences due to their popularity. Fuzzing is an effective testing technique to discover vulnerabilities. The main challenge of fuzzing JavaScript engines is to generate syntactically and semantically valid inputs such that deep functionalities can be explored. However, due to the dynamic nature of JavaScript and the special features of different engines, it is quite challenging to generate semantically meaningful test inputs. We observed that state-of-the-art semantic-aware JavaScript fuzzers usually require manually written rules to analyze the semantics for a JavaScript engine, which is labor-intensive, incomplete and engine-specific. Moreover, the error rate of generated test cases is still high. Another challenge is that existing fuzzers cannot generate new method calls that are not included in the initial seed corpus or pre-defined rules, which limits the bug-finding capability. To this end, we propose a novel semantic-aware fuzzing technique named SoFi. To guarantee the validity of the generated test cases, SoFi adopts a fine-grained program analysis to identify available variables and infer types of these variables for the mutation. Moreover, an automatic repair strategy is proposed to repair syntax/semantic errors in invalid test cases. To improve the exploration capability of SoFi, we propose a reflection-based analysis to identify unseen attributes and methods of objects, which are further used in the mutation. With fine-grained analysis and reflection-based augmentation, SoFi can generate more valid and diverse test cases. Besides, SoFi is general in different JavaScript engines without any manual configuration (e.g., the grammar rules). The evaluation results have shown that SoFi outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in generating semantically valid inputs, improving code coverage and detecting more bugs. SoFi discovered 51 bugs in popular JavaScript engines, 28 of which have been confirmed or fixed by the developers and 10 CVE IDs have been assigned.",

        "title": "Quantifying and Mitigating Privacy Risks of Contrastive Learning",
        "abstract": "Data is the key factor to drive the development of machine learning (ML) during the past decade. However, high-quality data, in particular labeled data, is often hard and expensive to collect. To leverage large-scale unlabeled data, self-supervised learning, represented by contrastive learning, is introduced. The objective of contrastive learning is to map different views derived from a training sample (e.g., through data augmentation) closer in their representation space, while different views derived from different samples more distant. In this way, a contrastive model learns to generate informative representations for data samples, which are then used to perform downstream ML tasks. Recent research has shown that machine learning models are vulnerable to various privacy attacks. However, most of the current efforts concentrate on models trained with supervised learning. Meanwhile, data samples' informative representations learned with contrastive learning may cause severe privacy risks as well. In this paper, we perform the first privacy analysis of contrastive learning through the lens of membership inference and attribute inference. Our experimental results show that contrastive models trained on image datasets are less vulnerable to membership inference attacks but more vulnerable to attribute inference attacks compared to supervised models. The former is due to the fact that contrastive models are less prone to overfitting, while the latter is caused by contrastive models' capability of representing data samples expressively. To remedy this situation, we propose the first privacy-preserving contrastive learning mechanism, Talos, relying on adversarial training. Empirical results show that Talos can successfully mitigate attribute inference risks for contrastive models while maintaining their membership privacy and model utility.",

        "abstract": "Public release of wrist-worn motion sensor data is growing. They enable and accelerate research in developing new algorithms to passively track daily activities, resulting in improved health and wellness utilities of smartwatches and activity trackers. But, when combined with sensitive attribute inference attack and linkage attack via re-identification of the same user in multiple datasets, undisclosed sensitive attributes can be revealed to unintended organizations with potentially adverse consequences for unsuspecting data contributing users. To guide both users and data collecting researchers, we characterize the re-identification risks inherent in motion sensor data collected from wrist-worn devices in users' natural environment. For this purpose, we use an open-set formulation, train a deep learning architecture with a new loss function, and apply our model to a new data set consisting of 10 weeks of daily sensor wearing by 353 users. We find that re-identification risk increases with an increase in the activity intensity. On average, such risk is 96% for a user when sharing a full day of sensor data.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning is vulnerable to adversarial examples--inputs designed to cause models to perform poorly. However, it is unclear if adversarial examples represent realistic inputs in the modeled domains. Diverse domains such as networks and phishing have domain constraints--complex relationships between features that an adversary must satisfy for an attack to be realized (in addition to any adversary-specific goals). In this paper, we explore how domain constraints limit adversarial capabilities and how adversaries can adapt their strategies to create realistic (constraint-compliant) examples. In this, we develop techniques to learn domain constraints from data, and show how the learned constraints can be integrated into the adversarial crafting process. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach in network intrusion and phishing datasets and find: (1) up to 82% of adversarial examples produced by state-of-the-art crafting algorithms violate domain constraints, (2) domain constraints are robust to adversarial examples; enforcing constraints yields an increase in model accuracy by up to 34%. We observe not only that adversaries must alter inputs to satisfy domain constraints, but that these constraints make the generation of valid adversarial examples far more challenging.",

The results showed that\nthe Pd/rGO nanocomposite not only exhibited much higher catalytic activity than the pure porous\nPd catalyst but also showed a very good catalytic stability due to the less Pd aggregation and increased\nlocal 4-NP concentration arose from rGO bonding attraction. Besides, the Pd-rGO nanocomposite\nshowed a kapp value of 0.383 min-1, which was 13 times higher than the pure Pd\n(0.0292 min-1), as well as a reliable 4-NP conversion rate of over 97%.\n\n\n\nThis study may provide a route for green-design and synthesis of heterogeneous catalyst\ncomposites with lower cost and better performance.\n",

        "abstract": "Secure messaging heavily relies on a session key negotiated by an Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) protocol. However, existing AKE protocols only verify the existence of a random secret key (corresponding to a certificated public key) stored in the terminal, rather than a legal user who uses the messaging application. In this paper, we propose a Biometrics-Authenticated Key Exchange (BAKE) framework, in which a secret key is derived from a user's biometric characteristics that are not necessary to be stored. To protect the privacy of users' biometric characteristics and realize one-round key exchange, we present an Asymmetric Fuzzy Encapsulation Mechanism (AFEM) to encapsulate messages with a public key derived from a biometric secret key, such that only a similar secret key can decapsulate them. To manifest the practicality, we present two AFEM constructions for two types of biometric secret keys and instantiate them with irises and fingerprints, respectively. We perform security analysis of BAKE and show its performance through extensive experiments.",

        "abstract": "Malware analysis aims to understand how malicious software carries out actions necessary for a successful attack and identify the possible impacts of the attack. While there has been substantial research focused on malware analysis and it is an important tool for practitioners in industry, the overall malware analysis process used by practitioners has not been studied. As a result, an understanding of common malware analysis workflows and their goals is lacking. A better understanding of these workflows could help identify new research directions that are impactful in practice. In order to better understand malware analysis processes, we present the results of a user study with 21 professional malware analysts with diverse backgrounds who work at 18 different companies. The study focuses on answering three research questions: (1) What are the different objectives of malware analysts in practice?, (2) What comprises a typical professional malware analyst workflow, and (3) When analysts decide to conduct dynamic analysis, what factors do they consider when setting up a dynamic analysis system? Based on participant responses, we propose a taxonomy of malware analysts and identify five common analysis workflows. We also identify challenges that analysts face during the different stages of their workflow. From the results of the study, we propose two potential directions for future research, informed by challenges described by the participants. Finally, we recommend guidelines for developers of malware analysis tools to consider in order to improve the usability of such tools.",

        "title": "MirChecker: Detecting Bugs in Rust Programs via Static Analysis",
        "abstract": "Safe system programming is often a crucial requirement due to its critical role in system software engineering. Conventional low-level programming languages such as C and assembly are efficient, but their inherent unsafe nature makes it undesirable for security-critical scenarios. Recently, Rust has become a promising alternative for safe system-level programming. While giving programmers fine-grained hardware control, its strong type system enforces many security properties including memory safety. However, Rust's security guarantee is not a silver bullet. Runtime crashes and memory-safety errors still harass Rust developers, causing damaging exploitable vulnerabilities, as reported by numerous studies. In this paper, we present and evaluate MirChecker, a fully automated bug detection framework for Rust programs by performing static analysis on Rust's Mid-level Intermediate Representation (MIR). Based on the observation of existing bugs found in Rust codebases, our approach keeps track of both numerical and symbolic information, detects potential runtime crashes and memory-safety errors by using constraint solving techniques, and outputs informative diagnostics to users. We evaluate MirChecker on both buggy code snippets extracted from existing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and real-world Rust codebases. Our experiments show that MirChecker can detect all the issues in our code snippets, and is capable of performing bug finding in real-world scenarios, where it detected a total of 33 previously unknown bugs including 16 memory-safety issues from 12 Rust packages (crates) with an acceptable false-positive rate.",

        "title": "Hidden Backdoors in Human-Centric Language Models",
        "abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) systems have been proven to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, whereby hidden features (backdoors) are trained into a language model and may only be activated by specific inputs (called triggers), to trick the model into producing unexpected behaviors. In this paper, we create covert and natural triggers for textual backdoor attacks, hidden backdoors, where triggers can fool both modern language models and human inspection. We deploy our hidden backdoors through two state-of-the-art trigger embedding methods. The first approach via homograph replacement, embeds the trigger into deep neural networks through the visual spoofing of lookalike characters replacement. The second approach uses subtle differences between text generated by language models and real natural text to produce trigger sentences with correct grammar and high fluency. We demonstrate that the proposed hidden backdoors can be effective across three downstream security-critical NLP tasks, representative of modern human-centric NLP systems, including toxic comment detection, neural machine translation (NMT), and question answering (QA). Our two hidden backdoor attacks can achieve an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of at least 97% with an injection rate of only 3% in toxic comment detection, 95.1% ASR in NMT with less than 0.5% injected data, and finally 91.12% ASR against QA updated with only 27 poisoning data samples on a model previously trained with 92,024 samples (0.029%). We are able to demonstrate the adversary's high success rate of attacks, while maintaining functionality for regular users, with triggers inconspicuous by the human administrators.",

        "abstract": "This presentation is based on the paper \"Search-based Local Blackbox Deobfuscation: Understand Improve and Mitigate'' from the same authors, which has been accepted for publication at ACM CCS 2021. Code obfuscation aims at protecting Intellectual Property and other secrets embedded into software from being retrieved. Recent works leverage advances in artificial intelligence (AI) with the hope of getting blackbox deobfuscators completely immune to standard (whitebox) protection mechanisms. While promising, this new field of AI-based, and more specifically search-based blackbox deobfuscation, is still in its infancy. In this article we deepen the state of search-based blackbox deobfuscation in three key directions: understand the current state-of-the-art, improve over it and design dedicated protection mechanisms. In particular, we define a novel generic framework for search-based blackbox deobfuscation encompassing prior work and highlighting key components; we are the first to point out that the search space underlying code deobfuscation is too unstable for simulation-based methods (e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search used in prior work) and advocate the use of robust methods such as S-metaheuristics; we propose the new optimized search-based blackbox deobfuscator Xyntia which significantly outperforms prior work in terms of success rate (especially with small time budget) while being completely immune to the most recent anti-analysis code obfuscation methods; and finally we propose two novel protections against search-based blackbox deobfuscation, allowing to counter Xyntia powerful attacks.",

        "abstract": "Despite recent widespread deployment of differential privacy, relatively little is known about what users think of differential privacy. In this work, we seek to explore users' privacy expectations related to differential privacy. Specifically, we investigate (1) whether users care about the protections afforded by differential privacy, and (2) whether they are therefore more willing to share their data with differentially private systems. Further, we attempt to understand (3) users' privacy expectations of the differentially private systems they may encounter in practice and (4) their willingness to share data in such systems. To answer these questions, we use a series of rigorously conducted surveys (n=2424). We find that users care about the kinds of information leaks against which differential privacy protects and are more willing to share their private information when the risks of these leaks are less likely to happen. Additionally, we find that the ways in which differential privacy is described in-the-wild haphazardly set users' privacy expectations, which can be misleading depending on the deployment. We synthesize our results into a framework for understanding a user's willingness to share information with differentially private systems, which takes into account the interaction between the user's prior privacy concerns and how differential privacy is described.",

        "title": "I Can See the Light: Attacks on Autonomous Vehicles Using Invisible Lights",
        "abstract": "The camera is one of the most important sensors for an autonomous vehicle (AV) to perform Environment Perception and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). To secure the camera, current autonomous vehicles not only utilize the data gathered from multiple sensors (e.g., Camera, Ultrasonic Sensor, Radar, or LiDAR) for environment perception and SLAM but also require the human driver to always realize the driving situation, which can effectively defend against previous attack approaches (i.e., creating visible fake objects or introducing perturbations to the camera by using advanced deep learning techniques). Different from their work, in this paper, we in-depth investigate the features of Infrared light and introduce a new security challenge called I-Can-See-the-Light- Attack (ICSL Attack) that can alter environment perception results and introduce SLAM errors to the AV. Specifically, we found that the invisible infrared lights (IR light) can successfully trigger the image sensor while human eyes cannot perceive IR lights. Moreover, the IR light appears magenta color in the camera, which triggers different pixels from the ambient visible light and can be selected as key points during the AV's SLAM process. By leveraging these features, we explore to i) generate invisible traffic lights, ii) create fake invisible objects, iii) ruin the in-car user experience, and iv) introduce SLAM errors to the AV. We implement the ICSL Attack by using off-the-shelf IR light sources and conduct an extensive evaluation on Tesla Model 3 and an enterprise-level autonomous driving platform under various environments and settings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the ICSL Attack and prove that current autonomous vehicle companies have not yet considered the ICSL Attack, which introduces severe security issues. To secure the AV, by exploring unique features of the IR light, we propose a software-based detection module to defend against the ICSL Attack.",

        "abstract": "HTTPS secures communications in the web and heavily relies on the Web PKI for authentication. In the Web PKI, Certificate Authorities (CAs) are organizations that provide trust and issue digital certificates. Web clients rely on public root stores maintained by operating systems or browsers, with hundreds of audited CAs as trust anchors. However, as reported by security incidents, hidden root CAs beyond the public root programs have been imported into local root stores, which allows adversaries to gain trust from web clients. In this paper, we provide the first client-side, nation-wide view of hidden root CAs in the Web PKI ecosystem. Through cooperation with a leading browser vendor, we analyze certificate chains in web visits, together with their verification statuses, from volunteer users in 5 months. In total, over 1.17 million hidden root certificates are captured and they cause a profound impact from the angle of web clients and traffic. Further, we identify around 5 thousand organizations that hold hidden root certificates, including fake root CAs that impersonate large trusted ones. Finally, we highlight that the implementation of hidden root CAs and certificates is highly flawed, and issues such as weak keys and signature algorithms are prevalent. Our findings uncover that the ecosystem of hidden root CAs is massive and dynamic, and shed light on the landscape of Web PKI security. Finally, we call for immediate efforts from the community to review the integrity of local root stores.",

        "abstract": "We present an integrated open-source framework to develop, deploy, and use event-driven distributed enclaved applications across heterogeneous Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Our framework strives for strong application authenticity and integrity guarantees, and optionally confidentiality and availability, while minimizing the run-time Trusted Computing Base (TCB). For software developers, our framework provides a high level of abstraction over the platform-specific TEE layer that provides isolation, attestation and secure communication amongst distributed application components, allowing developers to focus of application logic. We provide a notion of event-driven programming to develop distributed enclave applications in Rust and C for heterogeneous TEEs, including Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone and the open-source Sancus. This heterogeneity makes our framework uniquely suitable for a broad range of use cases which combine cloud processing, mobile and edge devices, and lightweight sensing and actuation.",

        "abstract": "Amplification Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks' traffic and harm are at an all-time high. To defend against such attacks, distributed attack mitigation platforms, such as traffic scrubbing centers that operate in peering locations, e.g., Internet Exchange Points (IXP), have been deployed in the Internet over the years. These attack mitigation platforms apply sophisticated techniques to detect attacks and drop attack traffic locally, thus, act as sensors of attacks. However, it has not yet been systematically evaluated and reported to what extent coordination of these views by different platforms can lead to more effective mitigation of amplification DDoS attacks. In this paper, we ask the question: \"Is it possible to mitigate more amplification attacks and drop more attack traffic when distributed attack mitigation platforms collaborate?\" To answer this question, we collaborate with eleven IXPs that operate in three different regions. These IXPs have more than 2,120 network members that exchange traffic at the rate of more than 11 Terabits per second. We collect network data over six months and analyze more than 120k amplification DDoS attacks. To our surprise, more than 80% of the amplification DDoS are not detected locally, although the majority of the attacks are visible by at least three IXPs. A closer investigation points to the shortcomings, such as the multi-protocol profile of modern amplification attacks, the duration of the attacks, and the difficulty of setting appropriate local attack traffic thresholds that will trigger mitigation. To overcome these limitations, we design and evaluate a collaborative architecture that allows participant mitigation platforms to exchange information about ongoing amplification attacks. Our evaluation shows that it is possible to collaboratively detect and mitigate the majority of attacks with limited exchange of information and drop as much as 90% more attack traffic locally.",

Adjuvants that are useful to develop vaccines for T-cell\nmediated autoimmune conditions.\n\n\n\nA literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar databases was made to identify\nreports regarding adjuvants, mechanisms of action, pro-inflammatory autoimmunity and vaccines\nto treat it, immunosuppressive agents, dendritic cells, helminths, immunotolerance, and infectious\ndiseases causing autoimmunity.\n\n\n\nSome anti-inflammatory drugs to treat autoimmune diseases inhibit DNA or protein synthesis\ncausing global immunosuppression, which is reduced by using biologics to block key steps\nin the inflammatory cascade. Fucosylated glycans from helminths, which are anti-inflammatory\nbut not immune-suppressive, offer an avenue to develop better drugs. Fucosylated glycans bind to\nDC-SIGN, a receptor on dendritic cells, entering the cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, biasing\ntheir immunoresponse to a sole Th2 anti-inflammatory immunity, while inhibiting the proinflammatory\nTh1/Th17 immunities. New anti-inflammatory drugs are particular plant-derived\nfucosylated glycosides with immunological properties like those of helminth-derived glycans.\nAnother class of anti-inflammatory immunomodulators is ligands of the aromatic-hydrocarbon\nreceptor, which by activating this intracellular receptor, boosts the differentiation of regulatory Tcells,\ninducing an anti-inflammatory immunity. However, aromatic ligands can also stimulate a\npro-inflammatory response. Exogenous aromatic ligands are usually delivered intracellularly using\ncarriers like nanoparticles, which upon translocation to the nucleus, activate this receptor.\n\n\n\nAutoimmune conditions and some infectious diseases, characterized by organ damage\ndue to pro-inflammatory autoimmune immunoresponses, could benefit from nonimmunosuppressive\nagents to modulate immunity; this way, averting a damaging inflammation.\n",

        "abstract": "Unsupervised Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been widely used in various security-related anomaly detection applications, owing to the great promise of being able to detect unforeseen threats and superior performance provided by Deep Neural Networks (DNN). However, the lack of interpretability creates key barriers to the adoption of DL models in practice. Unfortunately, existing interpretation approaches are proposed for supervised learning models and/or non-security domains, which are unadaptable for unsupervised DL models and fail to satisfy special requirements in security domains. In this paper, we propose DeepAID, a general framework aiming to (1) interpret DL-based anomaly detection systems in security domains, and (2) improve the practicality of these systems based on the interpretations. We first propose a novel interpretation method for unsupervised DNNs by formulating and solving well-designed optimization problems with special constraints for security domains. Then, we provide several applications based on our Interpreter as well as a model-based extension Distiller to improve security systems by solving domain-specific problems. We apply DeepAID over three types of security-related anomaly detection systems and extensively evaluate our Interpreter with representative prior works. Experimental results show that DeepAID can provide high-quality interpretations for unsupervised DL models while meeting the special requirements of security domains. We also provide several use cases to show that DeepAID can help security operators to understand model decisions, diagnose system mistakes, give feedback to models, and reduce false positives.",

        "title": "Appenzeller to Brie: Efficient Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Mixed-Mode Arithmetic and Z2k",
        "abstract": "Zero-knowledge proofs are highly flexible cryptographic protocols that are an important building block for many secure systems. Typically, these are defined with respect to statements that are formulated as arithmetic operations over a fixed finite field. This inflexibility is a disadvantage when it comes to complex programs, as some fields are more amenable to express certain operations than others. At the same time, there do not seem to be many proofs with a programming model similar to those found in modern computer architectures that perform arithmetic with 32 or 64 bit integers. In this work, we present solutions to both of these problems. First, we show how to efficiently check consistency of secret values between different instances of zero-knowledge protocols based on the commit-and-prove paradigm. This allows a protocol user to easily switch to the most efficient representation for a given task. To achieve this, we modify the extended doubly-authenticated bits (edabits) approach by Escudero et al. (Crypto 2020), originally developed for MPC, and optimize it for the zero-knowledge setting. As an application of our consistency check, we also introduce protocols for efficiently verifying truncations and comparisons of shared values both modulo a large prime p and modulo 2k. Finally, we complement our conversion protocols with new protocols for verifying arithmetic statements in Z2k. Here, we build upon recent interactive proof systems based on information-theoretic MACs and vector oblivious linear evaluation (VOLE), and show how this paradigm can be adapted to the ring setting. In particular, we show that supporting such modular operations natively in a proof system can be almost as efficient as proofs over large fields or bits, and this also easily plugs into our framework for zero-knowledge conversions.",

        "abstract": "Given a set of unlabeled images or (image, text) pairs, contrastive learning aims to pre-train an image encoder that can be used as a feature extractor for many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose EncoderMI, the first membership inference method against image encoders pre-trained by contrastive learning. In particular, given an input and a black-box access to an image encoder, EncoderMI aims to infer whether the input is in the training dataset of the image encoder. EncoderMI can be used 1) by a data owner to audit whether its (public) data was used to pre-train an image encoder without its authorization or 2) by an attacker to compromise privacy of the training data when it is private/sensitive. Our EncoderMI exploits the overfitting of the image encoder towards its training data. In particular, an overfitted image encoder is more likely to output more (or less) similar feature vectors for two augmented versions of an input in (or not in) its training dataset. We evaluate EncoderMI on image encoders pre-trained on multiple datasets by ourselves as well as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) image encoder, which is pre-trained on 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the Internet and released by OpenAI. Our results show that EncoderMI can achieve high accuracy, precision, and recall. We also explore a countermeasure against EncoderMI via preventing overfitting through early stopping. Our results show that it achieves trade-offs between accuracy of EncoderMI and utility of the image encoder, i.e., it can reduce the accuracy of EncoderMI, but it also incurs classification accuracy loss of the downstream classifiers built based on the image encoder.",

        "title": "Predictive Cipher-Suite Negotiation for Boosting Deployment of New Ciphers",
        "abstract": "Deployment of strong cryptographic ciphers for DNSSEC is essential for long term security of DNS. Unfortunately, due to the hurdles involved in adoption of new ciphers coupled with the limping deployment of DNSSEC, most domains use the weak RSA-1024 cipher. The main problem towards deployment of new ciphers is the resulting bloat of DNSSEC-signed responses due to support of multiple ciphers. This causes not only load on network, but worse, it results in DNS lookup failures, e.g., many network devices block such huge packets. Merely dropping the old ciphers and moving to use new stronger ciphers is not an option since this would break the DNS functionality for all the clients which do not support those new ciphers. The requirement to support new ciphers on both clients and servers coupled with the possible DNS failures due to the resulting large responses reduces the motivation to improve the security of DNS. We aim to resolve this vicious circle. In this work we propose an approach for deployment of new ciphers using a single-sided cipher-suite negotiation. Our mechanism uses machine learning for inferring the set of ciphers potentially supported by the client and then selecting the best cipher from that list. Our evaluations demonstrate that our single-sided cipher-suite negotiation not only allows the domains to unilaterally improve security without waiting for clients to integrate support for new secure ciphers, but it also improves DNS performance by reducing failures. Our results show that a single sided solution can, not only push adoption of new ciphers forward, but it also will resolve the existing interoperability problems with DNSSEC. Our design and preliminary analysis on the feasibility of applying machine learning to this context results in more secure and available DNSSEC. We outline our methodology for machine learning assisted cipher-suite negotiation and provide steps and challenges for future research.",

        "abstract": "The last decade has witnessed the emergence of algorithmic fairness as a new frontier in the application of theoretical computer science to problems of societal concern. The delay between academic investigation and industrial rhetoric acknowledging the concern has been surprisingly brief. This alacrity has positive and negative consequences, to wit, opportunity for quick adoption of technology and pressure for quick fixes. An early dichotomy in the literature differentiates between group notions of fairness - based on comparing prediction/classification statistics for (typically disjoint) demographic groups - and individual fairness, i.e., requiring that similar individuals be treated similarly [2]. Both face challenges. Group fairness criteria are appealing but can be meaningless [2, 8] or mutually incompatible [1, 7]; individual fairness requires a task-specific metric specifying the degree to which pairs of individuals are (dis)similar for the purposes of the task at hand. Considerable progress toward learning such a metric from an expert was made only recently [6]; see also [4]. Focus on similarity metrics has thrown into relief foundational questions about randomness and uncertainty. Some questions are specific to the philosophy of fairness, for example, questions about the value of an ex ante guarantee of fairness offered by a roll of the dice. Others involve the choice of metric, exposing the role of context. For example, should the likelihood that a job candidate will succeed in the advertised position be evaluated in the context of the work culture of the specific company that listed the position, or in an ideal, or even just a more egalitarian company with stronger culture of inclusivity?",

        "title": "Backdoor Pre-trained Models Can Transfer to All",
        "abstract": "Pre-trained general-purpose language models have been a dominating component in enabling real-world natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, a pre-trained model with backdoor can be a severe threat to the applications. Most existing backdoor attacks in NLP are conducted in the fine-tuning phase by introducing malicious triggers in the targeted class, thus relying greatly on the prior knowledge of the fine-tuning task. In this paper, we propose a new approach to map the inputs containing triggers directly to a predefined output representation of the pre-trained NLP models, e.g., a predefined output representation for the classification token in BERT, instead of a target label. It can thus introduce backdoor to a wide range of downstream tasks without any prior knowledge. Additionally, in light of the unique properties of triggers in NLP, we propose two new metrics to measure the performance of backdoor attacks in terms of both effectiveness and stealthiness. Our experiments with various types of triggers show that our method is widely applicable to different fine-tuning tasks (classification and named entity recognition) and to different models (such as BERT, XLNet, BART), which poses a severe threat. Furthermore, by collaborating with the popular online model repository Hugging Face, the threat brought by our method has been confirmed. Finally, we analyze the factors that may affect the attack performance and share insights on the causes of the success of our backdoor attack.",

        "title": "Detecting Missed Security Operations Through Differential Checking of Object-based Similar Paths",
        "abstract": "Missing a security operation such as a bound check has been a major cause of security-critical bugs. Automatically checking whether the code misses a security operation in large programs is challenging since it has to understand whether the security operation is indeed necessary in the context. Recent methods typically employ cross-checking to identify deviations as security bugs, which collects functionally similar program slices and infers missed security operations through majority-voting. An inherent limitation of such approaches is that they heavily rely on a substantial number of similar code pieces to enable cross-checking. In practice, many code pieces are unique, and thus we may be unable to find adequate similar code snippets to utilize cross-checking. In this paper, we present IPPO (Inconsistent Path Pairs as a bug Oracle), a static analysis framework for detecting security bugs based on differential checking. IPPO defines several novel rules to identify code paths that share similar semantics with respect to an object, and collects them as similar-path pairs. It then investigates the path pairs for identifying inconsistent security operations with respect to the object. If one path in a path pair enforces a security operation while the other does not, IPPO reports it as a potential security bug. By utilizing on object-based path-similarity analysis, IPPO achieves a higher precision, compared to conventional code-similarity analysis methods. Through differential checking of a similar-path pair, IPPO eliminates the requirement of constructing a large number of similar code pieces, addressing the limitation of traditional cross-checking approaches. We implemented IPPO and extensively evaluated it on four widely used open-source programs: Linux kernel, OpenSSL library, FreeBSD kernel, and PHP. IPPO found 154, 5, 1, and 1 new security bugs in the above systems, respectively. We have submitted patches for all these bugs, and 136 of them have been accepted by corresponding maintainers. The results confirm the effectiveness and usefulness of IPPO in practice.",

        "abstract": "Third-party libraries ease the software development process and thus have become an integral part of modern software engineering. Unfortunately, they are not usually vetted by human developers and thus are often responsible for introducing bugs, vulnerabilities, or attacks to programs that will eventually reach end-users. In this demonstration, we present a combined static and dynamic program analysis for inferring and enforcing third-party library permissions in server-side JavaScript. This analysis is centered around a RWX permission system across library boundaries. We demonstrate that our tools can detect zero-day vulnerabilities injected into popular libraries and often missed by state-of-the-art tools such as snyk test and npm audit.",

        "title": "Who's In Control? On Security Risks of Disjointed IoT Device Management Channels",
        "abstract": "An IoT device today can be managed through different channels, e.g., by its device manufacturer's app, or third-party channels such as Apple's Home app, or a smart speaker. Supporting each channel is a management framework integrated in the device and provided by different parties. For example, a device that integrates Apple HomeKit framework can be managed by Apple Home app. We call the management framework of this kind, including all its device- and cloud-side components, a device management channel (DMC). 4 third-party DMCs are widely integrated in today's IoT devices along with the device manufacturer's own DMC: HomeKit, Zigbee/Z-Wave compatible DMC, and smart-speaker Seamless DMC. Each of these DMCs is a standalone system that has full mandate on the device; however, if their security policies and control are not aligned, consequences can be serious, allowing a malicious user to utilize one DMC to bypass the security control imposed by the device owner on another DMC. We call such a problem Chaotic Device Management (Codema). This paper presents the first systematic study on Codema, based on a new model-guided approach. We purchased and analyzed 14 top-rated IoT devices and their integration and management of multiple DMCs. We found that Codema is both general and fundamental: these DMCs are generally not designed to coordinate with each other for security policies and control. The Codema problems enable the adversary to practically gain unauthorized access to sensitive devices (e.g., locks, garage doors, etc.). We reported our findings to affected parties (e.g., Apple, August, Philips Hue, ismartgate, Abode), which all acknowledged their importance. To mitigate this new threat, we designed and implemented CGuard, a new access control framework that device manufacturers can easily integrate into their IoT devices to protect end users. Our evaluation shows that CGuard is highly usable and acceptable to users, easy to adopt by manufacturers, and efficient and effective in security control.",

        "abstract": "How much does a machine learning algorithm leak about its training data, and why? Membership inference attacks are used as an auditing tool to quantify this leakage. In this paper, we present a comprehensivehypothesis testing framework that enables us not only to formally express the prior work in a consistent way, but also to design new membership inference attacks that use reference models to achieve a significantly higher power (true positive rate) for any (false positive rate) error. More importantly, we explainwhy different attacks perform differently. We present a template for indistinguishability games, and provide an interpretation of attack success rate across different instances of the game. We discuss various uncertainties of attackers that arise from the formulation of the problem, and show how our approach tries to minimize the attack uncertainty to the one bit secret about the presence or absence of a data point in the training set. We perform adifferential analysis between all types of attacks, explain the gap between them, and show what causes data points to be vulnerable to an attack (as the reasons vary due to different granularities of memorization, from overfitting to conditional memorization). Our auditing framework is openly accessible as part of thePrivacy Meter software tool.",

        "title": "Snipuzz: Black-box Fuzzing of IoT Firmware via Message Snippet Inference",
        "abstract": "The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has made people's lives more convenient, but it has also raised many security concerns. Due to the difficulty of obtaining and emulating IoT firmware, in the absence of internal execution information, black-box fuzzing of IoT devices has become a viable option. However, existing black-box fuzzers cannot form effective mutation optimization mechanisms to guide their testing processes, mainly due to the lack of feedback. In addition, because of the prevalent use of various and non-standard communication message formats in IoT devices, it is difficult or even impossible to apply existing grammar-based fuzzing strategies. Therefore, an efficient fuzzing approach with syntax inference is required in the IoT fuzzing domain. To address these critical problems, we propose a novel automatic black-box fuzzing for IoT firmware, termed Snipuzz. Snipuzz runs as a client communicating with the devices and infers message snippets for mutation based on the responses. Each snippet refers to a block of consecutive bytes that reflect the approximate code coverage in fuzzing. This mutation strategy based on message snippets considerably narrows down the search space to change the probing messages. We compared Snipuzz with four state-of-the-art IoT fuzzing approaches, i.e., IoTFuzzer, BooFuzz, Doona, and Nemesys. Snipuzz not only inherits the advantages of app-based fuzzing (e.g., IoTFuzzer), but also utilizes communication responses to perform efficient mutation. Furthermore, Snipuzz is lightweight as its execution does not rely on any prerequisite operations, such as reverse engineering of apps. We also evaluated Snipuzz on 20 popular real-world IoT devices. Our results show that Snipuzz could identify 5 zero-day vulnerabilities, and 3 of them could be exposed only by Snipuzz. All the newly discovered vulnerabilities have been confirmed by their vendors.",

        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph structure related tasks such as node classification and graph classification. However, GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing works mainly focus on attacking GNNs for node classification; nevertheless, the attacks against GNNs for graph classification have not been well explored. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on adversarial attacks against GNNs for graph classification via perturbing the graph structure. In particular, we focus on the most challenging attack, i.e., hard label black-box attack, where an attacker has no knowledge about the target GNN model and can only obtain predicted labels through querying the target model. To achieve this goal, we formulate our attack as an optimization problem, whose objective is to minimize the number of edges to be perturbed in a graph while maintaining the high attack success rate. The original optimization problem is intractable to solve, and we relax the optimization problem to be a tractable one, which is solved with theoretical convergence guarantee. We also design a coarse-grained searching algorithm and a query-efficient gradient computation algorithm to decrease the number of queries to the target GNN model. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our attack can effectively attack representative GNNs for graph classification with less queries and perturbations. We also evaluate the effectiveness of our attack under two defenses: one is well-designed adversarial graph detector and the other is that the target GNN model itself is equipped with a defense to prevent adversarial graph generation. Our experimental results show that such defenses are not effective enough, which highlights more advanced defenses.",

        "abstract": "Static program analysis tools can automatically prove many useful properties of programs. However, using static analysis to prove to a third party that a program satisfies a property requires revealing the program's source code. We introduce the concept of zero-knowledge static analysis, in which the prover constructs a zero-knowledge proof about the outcome of the static analysis without revealing the program. We present novel zero-knowledge proof schemes for intra- and inter-procedural abstract interpretation. Our schemes are significantly more efficient than the naive translation of the corresponding static analysis algorithms using existing schemes. We evaluate our approach empirically on real and synthetic programs; with a pairing-based zero knowledge proof scheme as the backend, we are able to prove the control flow analysis on a 2,000-line program in 1,738s. The proof is only 128 bytes and the verification time is 1.4ms. With a transparent zero knowledge proof scheme based on discrete-log, we generate the proof for the tainting analysis on a 12,800-line program in 406 seconds, the proof size is 282 kilobytes, and the verification time is 66 seconds.",

        "abstract": "HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) is an attack that exploits the HTTP processing discrepancies between two servers deployed in a proxy-origin configuration, allowing attackers to smuggle hidden requests through the proxy. While this idea is not new, HRS is soaring in popularity due to recently revealed novel exploitation techniques and real-life abuse scenarios. In this work, we step back from the highly-specific exploits hogging the spotlight, and present the first work that systematically explores HRS within a scientific framework. We design an experiment infrastructure powered by a novel grammar-based differential fuzzer, test 10 popular server/proxy/CDN technologies in combinations, identify pairs that result in processing discrepancies, and discover exploits that lead to HRS. Our experiment reveals previously unknown ways to manipulate HTTP requests for exploitation, and for the first time documents the server pairs prone to HRS.",

        "title": "PPE Circuits for Rational Polynomials",
        "abstract": "Pairings are a powerful algebraic setting for realizing cryptographic functionalities. One challenge for cryptographers who design pairing systems is that the complexity of many systems in terms of the number of group elements and equations to verify has been steadily increasing over the past decade and is approaching the point of being unwieldy. To combat this challenge, multiple independent works have utilized computers to help with the system design. One common design task that researchers seek to automate is summarized as follows: given a description of a set of trusted elements T (e.g., a public key) and a set of untrusted elements U (e.g., a signature), automatically generate an algorithm that verifies U with respect to T using the pairing and group operations. To date, none of the prior automation works for this task have support for solutions with rational polynomials in the exponents despite many pairing constructions employing them (e.g., Boneh-Boyen signatures, Gentry's IBE, Dodis-Yampolskiy VRF). We demonstrate how to support this essential class of pairing systems for automated exploration. Specifically, we present a solution for automatically generating a verification algorithm with novel support for rational polynomials. The class of verification algorithms we consider in this work is called PPE Circuits (introduced in [HVW20]). Intuitively, a PPE Circuit is a circuit supporting pairing and group operations, which can test whether a set of elements U verifies with respect to a set of elements T. We provide a formalization of the problem, an algorithm for searching for a PPE Circuit supporting rational polynomials, a software implementation, and a detailed performance evaluation. Our implementation was tested on over three dozen schemes, including over ten test cases that our tool can handle, but prior tools could not. For all test cases where a PPE Circuit exists, the tool produced a solution in three minutes or less.",

        "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made unprecedented performance in image synthesis and play a key role in various downstream applications of computer vision. However, GAN models trained on sensitive data also pose a distinct threat to privacy. In this poster, we present a novel over-representation based membership inference attack. Unlike prior attacks against GANs which focus on the overall metrics, such as the attack accuracy, our attack aims to make inference from the high-precision perspective, which allows the adversary to concentrate on inferring a sample as a member confidently. Initial experimental results demonstrate that the adversary can achieve a high precision attack even if the overall attack accuracy is about 50% for a well-trained GAN model. Our work will raise awareness of the importance of precision when GAN owners evaluate the privacy risks of their models.",

        "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)-synthesized table publishing lets people privately learn insights without access to the private table. However, existing studies on Membership Inference (MI) Attacks show promising results on disclosing membership of training datasets of GAN-synthesized tables. Different from those works focusing on discovering membership of a given data point, in this paper, we propose a novel Membership Collision Attack against GANs (TableGAN-MCA), which allows an adversary given only synthetic entries randomly sampled from a black-box generator to recover partial GAN training data. Namely, a GAN-synthesized table immune to state-of-the-art MI attacks is vulnerable to the TableGAN-MCA. The success of TableGAN-MCA is boosted by an observation that GAN-synthesized tables potentially collide with the training data of the generator. Our experimental evaluations on TableGAN-MCA have five main findings. First, TableGAN-MCA has a satisfying training data recovery rate on three commonly used real-world datasets against four generative models. Second, factors, including the size of GAN training data, GAN training epochs and the number of synthetic samples available to the adversary, are positively correlated to the success of TableGAN-MCA. Third, highly frequent data points have high risks of being recovered by TableGAN-MCA. Fourth, some unique data are exposed to unexpected high recovery risks in TableGAN-MCA, which may attribute to GAN's generalization. Fifth, as expected, differential privacy, without the consideration of the correlations between features, does not show commendable mitigation effect against the TableGAN-MCA. Finally, we propose two mitigation methods and show promising privacy and utility trade-offs when protecting against TableGAN-MCA.",

        "title": "Constantine: Automatic Side-Channel Resistance Using Efficient Control and Data Flow Linearization",
        "abstract": "In the era of microarchitectural side channels, vendors scramble to deploy mitigations for transient execution attacks, but leave traditional side-channel attacks against sensitive software (e.g., crypto programs) to be fixed by developers by means of constant-time programming (i.e., absence of secret-dependent code/data patterns). Unfortunately, writing constant-time code by hand is hard, as evidenced by the many flaws discovered in production side channel-resistant code. Prior efforts to automatically transform programs into constant-time equivalents offer limited security or compatibility guarantees, hindering their applicability to real-world software. In this paper, we present Constantine, a compiler-based system to automatically harden programs against microarchitectural side channels. Constantine pursues a radical design point where secret-dependent control and data flows are completely linearized (i.e., all involved code/data accesses are always executed). This strategy provides strong security and compatibility guarantees by construction, but its natural implementation leads to state explosion in real-world programs. To address this challenge, Constantine relies on carefully designed optimizations such as just-in-time loop linearization and aggressive function cloning for fully context-sensitive points-to analysis, which not only address state explosion, but also lead to an efficient and compatible solution. Constantine yields overheads as low as 16% on standard benchmarks and can handle a fully-fledged component from the production wolfSSL library.",

        "abstract": "AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) offers protection mechanisms for virtual machines in untrusted environments through memory and register encryption. To separate security-sensitive operations from software executing on the main x86 cores, SEV leverages the AMD Secure Processor (AMD-SP). This paper introduces a new approach to attack SEV-protected virtual machines (VMs) by targeting the AMD-SP. We present a voltage glitching attack that allows an attacker to execute custom payloads on the AMD-SPs of all microarchitectures that support SEV currently on the market (Zen 1, Zen 2, and Zen 3). The presented methods allow us to deploy a custom SEV firmware on the AMD-SP, which enables an adversary to decrypt a VM's memory. Furthermore, using our approach, we can extract endorsement keys of SEV-enabled CPUs, which allows us to fake attestation reports or to pose as a valid target for VM migration without requiring physical access to the target host. Moreover, we reverse-engineered the Versioned Chip Endorsement Key (VCEK) mechanism introduced with SEV Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). The VCEK binds the endorsement keys to the firmware version of TCB components relevant for SEV. Building on the ability to extract the endorsement keys, we show how to derive valid VCEKs for arbitrary firmware versions. With our findings, we prove that SEV cannot adequately protect confidential data in cloud environments from insider attackers, such as rogue administrators, on currently available CPUs.",

        "abstract": "\n\nGreat achievements have been made in improving the power conversion efficiencies of solar cells. However, the price of photovoltaic (PV)-generated electricity still cannot compete with that of conventionally generated power. Thus, novel solar cells made from nontoxic, earth-abundant, and chemically stable materials are desirable to decrease the costs of PV electricity generation.\n\n\n\n\n All-oxide solar cells are a promising next-generation PV technology, fulfilling the requirement of low-cost manufacturing under ambient conditions. This work aims to search for nontoxic, earth-abundant, and chemically stable narrow-bandgap semiconductors for energy application like all-oxide solar cells. \n\n\n\n\nThis work examines a family of perovskite rare-earth (i.e., Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Yb) orthoferrites with XRD analysis, SEM, photoresponse, absorption spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, fluorescence spectra measured with the laser Raman spectrometer, valence band spectra, the Kelvin probe, the Hall Effect experiment, and theoretical calculation on band structure and the density of states, to screen for the narrow-bandgap semiconductors.\n\n\n\n\nThe novel Pb-free perovskite narrow-bandgap absorbers, CeFeO3, PrFeO3, TbFeO3, DyFeO3, HoFeO3 and YbFeO3 which are earth-abundant and nontoxic, were screened out potentially for use in all-oxide solar cells or other photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications. Among them, YbFeO3 is approved having an indirect bandgap of approximately 1.0 eV with a maximum Shockley-Queisser efficiency of 31% for single p-n junction solar cells. This work breaks new ground in the search for narrow bandgap semiconductors potential for energy applications. \n\n",

        "title": "Igor: Crash Deduplication Through Root-Cause Clustering",
        "abstract": "Fuzzing has emerged as the most effective bug-finding technique. The output of a fuzzer is a set of proof-of-concept (PoC) test cases for all observed \"unique'' crashes. It costs developers substantial efforts to analyze each crashing test case. This, mostly manual, process has lead to the number of reported crashes out-pacing the number of bug fixes. Automatic crash deduplication techniques, which mostly rely on coverage profiles and stack hashes, are supposed to alleviate these pressures. However, these techniques both inflate actual bug counts and falsely conflate unrelated bugs. This hinders, rather than helps, developers, and calls for more accurate techniques. The highly-stochastic nature of fuzzing means that PoCs commonly exercise many program behaviors that are orthogonal to the crash's underlying root cause. This diversity in program behaviors manifests as a diversity in crashes, contributing to bug-count inflation and conflation. Based on this insight, we develop Igor, an automated dual-phase crash deduplication technique. By minimizing each PoC's execution trace, we obtain pruned test cases that exercise the critical behavior necessary for triggering a bug. Then, we use a graph similarity comparison to cluster crashes based on the control-flow graph of the minimized execution traces, with each cluster mapping back to a single, unique root cause. We evaluate Igor against 39 bugs resulting from 254,000 PoCs, distributed over 10 programs. Our results show that Igor accurately groups these crashes into 48 uniquely identifiable clusters, while other state-of-the-art methods yield bug counts at least one order of magnitude larger.",

        "abstract": "There is significant enthusiasm for the employment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for important tasks in major wireless communication systems: channel estimation and decoding in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, end-to-end autoencoder system design, radio signal classification, and signal authentication. Unfortunately, DNNs can be susceptible to adversarial examples, potentially making such wireless systems fragile and vulnerable to attack. In this work, by designing robust adversarial examples that meet key criteria, we perform a comprehensive study of the threats facing DNN-based wireless systems. We model the problem of adversarial wireless perturbations as an optimization problem that incorporates domain constraints specific to different wireless systems. This allows us to generate wireless adversarial perturbations that can be applied to wireless signals on-the-fly (i.e., with no need to know the target signals a priori), are undetectable from natural wireless noise, and are robust against removal. We show that even in the presence of significant defense mechanisms deployed by the communicating parties, our attack performs significantly better compared to existing attacks against DNN-based wireless systems. In particular, the results demonstrate that even when employing well-considered defenses, DNN-based wireless communication systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and call into question the employment of DNNs for a number of tasks in robust wireless communication.",

        "abstract": "Secure allocators have been extensively studied to mitigate heap vulnerabilities. They employ safe designs and randomized mechanisms to stop or mitigate heap exploitation. Despite extensive research efforts, secure allocators can only be evaluated by with theoretical analysis or pre-defined data sets, which are insufficient to effectively reflect powerful adversaries in the real world. In this paper, we present HardsHeap, an automatic tool for evaluating secure allocators. The key idea of HardsHeap is to use random testing (i.e., fuzzing) to evaluate secure allocators. To handle the diverse properties of secure allocators, HardsHeap supports an extensible framework, making it easy to write a validation logic for each property. Moreover, HardsHeap employs sampling-based testing, which enables us to evaluate a probabilistic mechanism prevalent in secure allocators. To eliminate redundancy in findings from HardsHeap, we devise a new technique called Statistical Significance Delta Debugging (SSDD), which extends the existing delta debugging for stochastically reproducible test cases. We evaluated HardsHeap to 10 secure allocators. Consequently, we found 56 interesting test cases, including several unsecure yet underestimated behaviors for handling large objects in secure allocators. Moreover, we discovered 10 implementation bugs. One of the bugs is integer overflow in secure allocators, making them even more invulnerable than ordinary allocators. Our evaluation also shows that SSDD successfully reduces test cases by 37.2% on average without a loss of reproducibility.",

        "abstract": "As the attack surface and the number of security incidents in mobile communication networks increase, a common language for threat intelligence gathering and sharing among different parties becomes essential. We addressed this by developing the Bhadra framework [4], a domain-specific conceptual framework that captures adversarial behaviors in end-to-end communication over the mobile networks in our previous work. Nevertheless, the acceptance or adoptability of the framework by the mobile communications industry is still unclear. In this work, we built a threat modeling tool as a companion for Bhadra and conduct a user study with industry experts to evaluate the framework's usefulness and explore its potential use cases besides threat modeling and sharing. Our preliminary results indicate that the mobile communication industry would benefit from a threat modeling framework with a companion tool and its use cases, making it a potential candidate to integrate within work processes.",

        "title": "ECMO: Peripheral Transplantation to Rehost Embedded Linux Kernels",
        "abstract": "Dynamic analysis based on the full-system emulator QEMU is widely used for various purposes.However, it is challenging to run firmware images of embedded devices in QEMU, especially the process to boot the Linux kernel (we call this process rehosting the Linux kernel in this paper). That's because embedded devices usually use different system-on-chips (SoCs) from multiple vendors and only a limited number of SoCs are currently supported in QEMU. In this work, we propose a technique called peripheral transplantation. The main idea is to transplant the device drivers of designated peripherals into the Linux kernel binary. By doing so, it can replace the peripherals in the kernel that are currently unsupported in QEMU with supported ones, thus making the Linux kernel rehostable. After that, various applications can be built. We implemented this technique inside a prototype system called ECMO and applied it to 815 firmware images, which consist of 20 kernel versions and 37 device models. The result shows that ECMO can successfully transplant peripherals for all the 815 Linux kernels. Among them, 710 kernels can be successfully rehosted, i.e., launching a user-space shell (87.1% success rate). The failed cases are mainly because the root file system format (ramfs) is not supported by the kernel. Meanwhile, we are able to inject rather complex drivers (i.e., NIC driver) for all the rehosted Linux kernels by installing kernel modules. We further build three applications, i.e., kernel crash analysis, rootkit forensic analysis, and kernel fuzzing, based on the rehosted kernels to demonstrate the usage scenarios of ECMO.",

        "abstract": "On an Ethereum node, txpool (a.k.a. mempool) is a buffer storing unconfirmed transactions and controls what downstream services can see, such as mining and transaction propagation. This work presents the first security study on Ethereum txpool designs. We discover flawed transaction handling in all known Ethereum clients (e.g., Geth), and by exploiting it, design a series of low-cost denial-of-service attacks named DETER. A DETER attacker can disable a remote Ethereum node's txpool and deny the critical downstream services in mining, transaction propagation, Gas station, etc. By design, DETER attacks incur zero or low Ether cost. The attack can be amplified to cause global disruption to an Ethereum network by targeting centralized network services there (e.g., mining pools and transaction relay services). By evaluating local nodes, we verify the effectiveness and low cost of DETER attacks on all known Ethereum clients and in major testnets. We design non-trivial measurement methods against blackbox mainnet nodes and conduct light probes to confirm that popular mainnet services are exploitable under DETER attacks. We propose mitigation schemes that reduce a DETER attack's success rate down to zero while preserving the miners' revenue.",

        "abstract": "Along with gaining popularity of Real-Time Bidding (RTB) based programmatic advertising, the click farm based invalid traffic, which leverages massive real smartphones to carry out large-scale ad fraud campaigns, is becoming one of the major threats against online advertisement. In this study, we take an initial step towards the detection and large-scale measurement of the click farm based invalid traffic. Our study begins with a measurement on the device's features using a real-world labeled dataset, which reveals a series of features distinguishing the fraudulent devices from the benign ones. Based on these features, we develop EvilHunter, a system for detecting fraudulent devices through ad bid request logs with a focus on clustering fraudulent devices. EvilHunter functions by 1) building a classifier to distinguish fraudulent and benign devices; 2) clustering devices based on app usage patterns; and 3) relabeling devices in clusters through majority voting. EvilHunter demonstrates 97% precision and 95% recall on a real-world labeled dataset. By investigating a super click farm, we reveal several cheating strategies that are commonly adopted by fraudulent clusters. We further reduce the overhead of EvilHunter and discuss how to deploy the optimized EvilHunter in a real-world system. We are in partnership with a leading ad verification company to integrate EvilHunter into their industrial platform.",

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. A great effort has been directed to developing effective defenses against adversarial attacks and finding vulnerabilities of proposed defenses. A recently proposed defense called Trapdoor-enabled Detection (TeD) deliberately injects trapdoors into DNN models to trap and detect adversarial examples targeting categories protected by TeD. TeD can effectively detect existing state-of-the-art adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel black-box adversarial attack on TeD, called Feature-Indistinguishable Attack (FIA). It circumvents TeD by crafting adversarial examples indistinguishable in the feature (i.e., neuron-activation) space from benign examples in the target category. To achieve this goal, FIA jointly minimizes the distance to the expectation of feature representations of benign samples in the target category and maximizes the distances to positive adversarial examples generated to query TeD in the preparation phase. A constraint is used to ensure that the feature vector of a generated adversarial example is within the distribution of feature vectors of benign examples in the target category. Our extensive empirical evaluation with different configurations and variants of TeD indicates that our proposed FIA can effectively circumvent TeD. FIA opens a door for developing much more powerful adversarial attacks. The FIA code is available at: https://github.com/CGCL-codes/FeatureIndistinguishableAttack.",

        "title": "Robust Detection of Machine-induced Audio Attacks in Intelligent Audio Systems with Microphone Array",
        "abstract": "With the popularity of intelligent audio systems in recent years, their vulnerabilities have become an increasing public concern. Existing studies have designed a set of machine-induced audio attacks, such as replay attacks, synthesis attacks, hidden voice commands, inaudible attacks, and audio adversarial examples, which could expose users to serious security and privacy threats. To defend against these attacks, existing efforts have been treating them individually. While they have yielded reasonably good performance in certain cases, they can hardly be combined into an all-in-one solution to be deployed on the audio systems in practice. Additionally, modern intelligent audio devices, such as Amazon Echo and Apple HomePod, usually come equipped with microphone arrays for far-field voice recognition and noise reduction. Existing defense strategies have been focusing on single- and dual-channel audio, while only few studies have explored using multi-channel microphone array for defending specific types of audio attack. Motivated by the lack of systematic research on defending miscellaneous audio attacks and the potential benefits of multi-channel audio, this paper builds a holistic solution for detecting machine-induced audio attacks leveraging multi-channel microphone arrays on modern intelligent audio systems. Specifically, we utilize magnitude and phase spectrograms of multi-channel audio to extract spatial information and leverage a deep learning model to detect the fundamental difference between human speech and adversarial audio generated by the playback machines. Moreover, we adopt an unsupervised domain adaptation training framework to further improve the model's generalizability in new acoustic environments. Evaluation is conducted under various settings on a public multi-channel replay attack dataset and a self-collected multi-channel audio attack dataset involving 5 types of advanced audio attacks. The results show that our method can achieve an equal error rate (EER) as low as 6.6% in detecting a variety of machine-induced attacks. Even in new acoustic environments, our method can still achieve an EER as low as 8.8%.",

        "title": "Usable User Authentication on a Smartwatch using Vibration",
        "abstract": "Smartwatches have come into wide use in recent years, and a number of smartwatch applications that improve convenience and user health are being developed and introduced constantly. Moreover, the latest smartwatches are now designed to operate without their paired smartphones, and as such, it is necessary for smartwatches to independently authenticate users. In these current devices, personal identification numbers (PIN) or patterns are entered to authenticate users, but these methods require inconvenient interaction for the user and are not highly secure. Particularly relevant to smartwatch technology, even user authentication based on biometric information needs either special sensors capable of measuring biometric information or user interaction. In this paper, we propose a usable method for user authentication on smartwatches without additional devices. Based on the fact that vibration is absorbed, reflected, and propagated differently according to the physical structure of each human body, our method is designed as a challenge-response scheme, in which the challenge is a random sequence of multiple vibration types that are already built into current smartwatches. The responses to vibrations are measured by the default gyroscope and accelerometer sensors in smartwatches. Moreover, our method is the first working model for commercial smartwatch models with low specifications when vibrating and measuring responses. We evaluated our method using a commercial smartwatch, and the results show that our method is able to authenticate a user with an equal error rate (EER) of 1.37%.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of efficiently verifying a commitment in a two-party computation. This addresses the scenario where a party P1 commits to a value x to be used in a subsequent secure computation with another party P2 that wants to receive assurance that P1 did not cheat, i.e. that x was indeed the value inputted into the secure computation. Our constructions operate in the publicly verifiable covert (PVC) security model, which is a relaxation of the malicious model of MPC, appropriate in settings where P1 faces a reputational harm if caught cheating. We introduce the notion of PVC commitment scheme and indexed hash functions to build commitment schemes tailored to the PVC framework, and propose constructions for both arithmetic and Boolean circuits that result in very efficient circuits. From a practical standpoint, our constructions for Boolean circuits are 60x faster to evaluate securely, and use 36x less communication than baseline methods based on hashing. Moreover, we show that our constructions are tight in terms of required non-linear operations, by proving lower bounds on the nonlinear gate count of commitment verification circuits. Finally, we present a technique to amplify the security properties our constructions that allows to efficiently recover malicious guarantees with statistical security.",

        "abstract": "This study presents Periscope, a novel side-channel attack that exploits human-coupled electromagnetic (EM) emanations from touchscreens to infer sensitive inputs on a mobile device. Periscope is motivated by the observation that finger movement over the touchscreen leads to time-varying coupling between these two. Consequently, it impacts the screen's EM emanations that can be picked up by a remote sensory device. We intend to map between EM measurements and finger movements to recover the inputs. As the significant technical contribution of this work, we build an analytic model that outputs finger movement trajectories based on given EM readings. Our approach does not need a large amount of labeled dataset for offline model training, but instead a couple of samples to parameterize the user-specific analytic model. We implement Periscope with simple electronic components and conduct a suite of experiments to validate this attack's impact. Experimental results show that Periscope achieves a recovery rate over 6-digit PINs of 56.2% from a distance of 90 cm. Periscope is robust against environment dynamics and can well adapt to different device models and setting contexts.",

        "title": "Automated Bug Hunting With Data-Driven Symbolic Root Cause Analysis",
        "abstract": "The increasing cost of successful cyberattacks has caused a mindset shift, whereby defenders now employ proactive defenses, namely software bug hunting, alongside existing reactive measures (firewalls, IDS, IPS) to protect systems. Unfortunately the path from hunting bugs to deploying patches remains laborious and expensive, requires human expertise, and still misses serious memory corruptions. Motivated by these challenges, we propose bug hunting using symbolically reconstructed states based on execution traces to achieve better detection and root cause analysis of overflow, use-after-free, double free, and format string bugs across user programs and their imported libraries. We discover that with the right use of widely available hardware processor tracing and partial memory snapshots, powerful symbolic analysis can be used on real-world programs while managing path explosion. Better yet, data can be captured from production deployments of live software on end-host systems transparently, aiding in the analysis of user clients and long-running programs like web servers. We implement a prototype of our design, Bunkerbuster, for Linux and evaluate it on 15 programs, where it finds 39 instances of our target bug classes, 8 of which have never before been reported and have lead to 1 EDB and 3 CVE IDs being issued. These 0-days were patched by developers using Bunkerbuster's reports, independently validating their usefulness. In a side-by-side comparison, our system uncovers 8 bugs missed by AFL and QSYM, and correctly classifies 4 that were previously detected, but mislabeled by AddressSanitizer. Our prototype accomplishes this with 7.21% recording overhead.",

        "title": "Realtime Robust Malicious Traffic Detection via Frequency Domain Analysis",
        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) based malicious traffic detection is an emerging security paradigm, particularly for zero-day attack detection, which is complementary to existing rule based detection. However, the existing ML based detection achieves low detection accuracy and low throughput incurred by inefficient traffic features extraction. Thus, they cannot detect attacks in realtime, especially in high throughput networks. Particularly, these detection systems similar to the existing rule based detection can be easily evaded by sophisticated attacks. To this end, we propose Whisper, a realtime ML based malicious traffic detection system that achieves both high accuracy and high throughput by utilizing frequency domain features. It utilizes sequential information represented by the frequency domain features to achieve bounded information loss, which ensures high detection accuracy, and meanwhile constrains the scale of features to achieve high detection throughput. In particular, attackers cannot easily interfere with the frequency domain features and thus Whisper is robust against various evasion attacks. Our experiments with 42 types of attacks demonstrate that, compared with the state-of-the-art systems, Whisper can accurately detect various sophisticated and stealthy attacks, achieving at most 18.36% improvement of AUC, while achieving two orders of magnitude throughput. Even under various evasion attacks, Whisper is still able to maintain around 90% detection accuracy.",

        "title": "Side-Channel Attacks on Query-Based Data Anonymization",
        "abstract": "A longstanding problem in computer privacy is that of data anonymization. One common approach is to present a query interface to analysts, and anonymize on a query-by-query basis. In practice, this approach often uses a standard database back end, and presents the query semantics of the database to the analyst. This paper presents a class of novel side-channel attacks that work against any query-based anonymization system that uses a standard database back end. The attacks exploit the implicit conditional logic of database runtime optimizations. They manipulate this logic to trigger timing and exception-throwing side-channels based on the contents of the data. We demonstrate the attacks on the implementation of the CHORUS Differential Privacy system released by Uber as an open source project. We obtain perfect reconstruction of millions of data values even with a Differential Privacy budget smaller than epsilon = 1.0 and no prior knowledge. The paper also presents the design of a general defense to the runtime-optimization attacks, and a concrete implementation of the defense in the latest version of Diffix. The defense works without modifications to the back end database, and operates by modifying SQL to eliminate the runtime optimization or disable the side-channels. In addition, two other attacks that exploit specific flaws in Diffix and CHORUS are reported. These have been fixed in the respective implementations.",

        "abstract": "The central question studied in this paper is R\u00e9nyi Differential Privacy (RDP) guarantees for general discrete local randomizers in the shuffle privacy model. In the shuffle model, each of the n clients randomizes its response using a local differentially private (LDP) mechanism and the untrusted server only receives a random permutation (shuffle) of the client responses without association to each client. The principal result in this paper is the first direct RDP bounds for general discrete local randomization in the shuffle privacy model, and we develop new analysis techniques for deriving our results which could be of independent interest. In applications, such an RDP guarantee is most useful when we use it for composing several private interactions. We numerically demonstrate that, for important regimes, with composition our bound yields an improvement in privacy guarantee by a factor of $8\\times$ over the state-of-the-art approximate Differential Privacy (DP) guarantee (with standard composition) for shuffle models. Moreover, combining with Poisson subsampling, our result leads to at least $10\\times$ improvement over subsampled approximate DP with standard composition.",
