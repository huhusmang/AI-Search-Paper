        "title": "Designing New Operating Primitives to Improve Fuzzing Performance",
        "abstract": "Fuzzing is a software testing technique that finds bugs by repeatedly injecting mutated inputs to a target program. Known to be a highly practical approach, fuzzing is gaining more popularity than ever before. Current research on fuzzing has focused on producing an input that is more likely to trigger a vulnerability. In this paper, we tackle another way to improve the performance of fuzzing, which is to shorten the execution time of each iteration. We observe that AFL, a state-of-the-art fuzzer, slows down by 24x because of file system contention and the scalability of fork() system call when it runs on 120 cores in parallel. Other fuzzers are expected to suffer from the same scalability bottlenecks in that they follow a similar design pattern. To improve the fuzzing performance, we design and implement three new operating primitives specialized for fuzzing that solve these performance bottlenecks and achieve scalable performance on multi-core machines. Our experiment shows that the proposed primitives speed up AFL and LibFuzzer by 6.1 to 28.9x and 1.1 to 735.7x, respectively, on the overall number of executions per second when targeting Google's fuzzer test suite with 120 cores. In addition, the primitives improve AFL's throughput up to 7.7x with 30 cores, which is a more common setting in data centers. Our fuzzer-agnostic primitives can be easily applied to any fuzzer with fundamental performance improvement and directly benefit large-scale fuzzing and cloud-based fuzzing services.",

        "title": "Herding Vulnerable Cats: A Statistical Approach to Disentangle Joint Responsibility for Web Security in Shared Hosting",
        "abstract": "Hosting providers play a key role in fighting web compromise, but their ability to prevent abuse is constrained by the security practices of their own customers. Shared hosting, offers a unique perspective since customers operate under restricted privileges and providers retain more control over configurations. We present the first empirical analysis of the distribution of web security features and software patching practices in shared hosting providers, the influence of providers on these security practices, and their impact on web compromise rates. We construct provider-level features on the global market for shared hosting -- containing 1,259 providers -- by gathering indicators from 442,684 domains. Exploratory factor analysis of 15 indicators identifies four main latent factors that capture security efforts: content security, webmaster security, web infrastructure security and web application security. We confirm, via a fixed-effect regression model, that providers exert significant influence over the latter two factors, which are both related to the software stack in their hosting environment. Finally, by means of GLM regression analysis of these factors on phishing and malware abuse, we show that the four security and software patching factors explain between 10% and 19% of the variance in abuse at providers, after controlling for size. For web-application security for instance, we found that when a provider moves from the bottom 10% to the best-performing 10%, it would experience 4 times fewer phishing incidents. We show that providers have influence over patch levels--even higher in the stack, where CMSes can run as client-side software--and that this influence is tied to a substantial reduction in abuse levels.",

        "title": "BBA+: Improving the Security and Applicability of Privacy-Preserving Point Collection",
        "abstract": "Black-box accumulation (BBA) has recently been introduced as a building-block for a variety of user-centric protocols such as loyalty, refund, and incentive systems. Loosely speaking, this building block may be viewed as a cryptographic \"piggy bank\" that allows a user to collect points (aka incentives, coins, etc.) in an anonymous and unlinkable way. A piggy bank may be \"robbed\" at some point by a user, letting her spend the collected points, thereby only revealing the total amount inside the piggy bank and its unique serial number. In this paper we present BBA+, a definitional framework extending the BBA model in multiple ways: (1) We support offline systems in the sense that there does not need to be a permanent connection to a serial number database to check whether a presented piggy bank has already been robbed. (2) We enforce the collection of \"negative points\" which users may not voluntarily collect, as this is, for example, needed in pre-payment or reputation systems. (3) The security property formalized for \\bbap schemes is stronger and more natural than for BBA: Essentially, we demand that the amount claimed to be inside a piggy bank must be exactly the amount legitimately collected with this piggy bank. As piggy bank transactions need to be unlinkable at the same time, defining this property is highly non-trivial. (4) We also define a stronger form of privacy, namely forward and backward privacy. Besides the framework, we show how to construct a BBA+ system from cryptographic building blocks and present the promising results of a smartphone-based prototypical implementation. They show that our current instantiation may already be useable in practice, allowing to run transactions within a second---while we have not exhausted the potential for optimizations.",

        "title": "Composing Differential Privacy and Secure Computation: A Case Study on Scaling Private Record Linkage",
        "abstract": "Private record linkage (PRL) is the problem of identifying pairs of records that are similar as per an input matching rule from databases held by two parties that do not trust one another. We identify three key desiderata that a PRL solution must ensure: (1) perfect precision and high recall of matching pairs, (2) a proof of end-to-end privacy, and (3) communication and computational costs that scale subquadratically in the number of input records. We show that all of the existing solutions for PRL? including secure 2-party computation (S2PC), and their variants that use non-private or differentially private (DP) blocking to ensure subquadratic cost -- violate at least one of the three desiderata. In particular, S2PC techniques guarantee end-to-end privacy but have either low recall or quadratic cost. In contrast, no end-to-end privacy guarantee has been formalized for solutions that achieve subquadratic cost. This is true even for solutions that compose DP and S2PC: DP does not permit the release of any exact information about the databases, while S2PC algorithms for PRL allow the release of matching records. In light of this deficiency, we propose a novel privacy model, called output constrained differential privacy, that shares the strong privacy protection of DP, but allows for the truthful release of the output of a certain function applied to the data. We apply this to PRL, and show that protocols satisfying this privacy model permit the disclosure of the true matching records, but their execution is insensitive to the presence or absence of a single non-matching record. We find that prior work that combine DP and S2PC techniques even fail to satisfy this end-to-end privacy model. Hence, we develop novel protocols that provably achieve this end-to-end privacy guarantee, together with the other two desiderata of PRL. Our empirical evaluation also shows that our protocols obtain high recall, scale near linearly in the size of the input databases and the output set of matching pairs, and have communication and computational costs that are at least 2 orders of magnitude smaller than S2PC baselines.",

The continuous increase in the numbers and sophistication levels of fake accounts constitutes a big threat to the privacy and to the security of honest OSN users. Uninformed OSN users could be easily fooled into accepting friendship links with fake accounts, giving them by that access to personal information they intend to exclusively share with their real friends. Moreover, these fake accounts subvert the security of the system by spreading malware, connecting with honest users for nefarious goals such as sexual harassment or child abuse, and make the social computing environment mostly untrustworthy. The tutorial introduces the main available research results available in this area, and presents our work on collaborative identity validation techniques to estimate OSN profiles trustworthiness.",

The deceptive filesystem transparently creates multiple levels of stacking to protect the base filesystem and monitor file accesses, hide and redact sensitive files with baits, and inject decoys onto fake system views purveyed to untrusted subjects, all while maintaining a pristine state to legitimate processes. Our prototype implementation leverages a kernel hot-patch to seamlessly integrate the new filesystem module into live and existing environments. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with a use case on the nefarious Erebus ransomware. We also show that the filesystem adds no I/O overhead for legitimate users.",

        "abstract": "HTTPS error warnings are supposed to alert browser users to network attacks. Unfortunately, a wide range of non-attack circumstances trigger hundreds of millions of spurious browser warnings per month. Spurious warnings frustrate users, hinder the widespread adoption of HTTPS, and undermine trust in browser warnings. We investigate the root causes of HTTPS error warnings in the field, with the goal of resolving benign errors. We study a sample of over 300 million errors that Google Chrome users encountered in the course of normal browsing. After manually reviewing more than 2,000 error reports, we developed automated rules to classify the top causes of HTTPS error warnings. We are able to automatically diagnose the root causes of two-thirds of error reports. To our surprise, we find that more than half of errors are caused by client-side or network issues instead of server misconfigurations. Based on these findings, we implemented more actionable warnings and other browser changes to address client-side error causes. We further propose solutions for other classes of root causes.",

We quantify what countries are geographically logical to see on a network path traveling between two nations through the use of convex hulls circumscribing major population centers, and then compare that to the nation states observed in utilized paths. Our preliminary results show that the majority of paths, 52%, unnecessarily expose traffic to at least one nation. We also explore which nation states are disproportionately allowed to observe and manipulate a larger fraction of Internet traffic than they otherwise should.",

        "title": "The Return of Coppersmith's Attack: Practical Factorization of Widely Used RSA Moduli",
        "abstract": "We report on our discovery of an algorithmic flaw in the construction of primes for RSA key generation in a widely-used library of a major manufacturer of cryptographic hardware. The primes generated by the library suffer from a significant loss of entropy. We propose a practical factorization method for various key lengths including 1024 and 2048 bits. Our method requires no additional information except for the value of the public modulus and does not depend on a weak or a faulty random number generator. We devised an extension of Coppersmith's factorization attack utilizing an alternative form of the primes in question. The library in question is found in NIST FIPS 140-2 and CC~EAL~5+ certified devices used for a wide range of real-world applications, including identity cards, passports, Trusted Platform Modules, PGP and tokens for authentication or software signing. As the relevant library code was introduced in 2012 at the latest (and probably earlier), the impacted devices are now widespread. Tens of thousands of such keys were directly identified, many with significant impacts, especially for electronic identity documents, software signing, Trusted Computing and PGP. We estimate the number of affected devices to be in the order of at least tens of millions. The worst cases for the factorization of 1024 and 2048-bit keys are less than 3 CPU-months and 100 CPU-years on single core of common recent CPUs, respectively, while the expected time is half of that of the worst case. The attack can be parallelized on multiple CPUs. Worse still, all susceptible keys contain a strong fingerprint that is verifiable in microseconds on an ordinary laptop -- meaning that all vulnerable keys can be quickly identified, even in very large datasets.",

Achieving fairness --- that all parties learn the output or no one does -- is a long studied problem with known impossibility results in the standard model if a majority of parties are dishonest. We present a new model for achieving fairness in MPC against dishonest majority by using public bulletin boards implemented via existing infrastructure such as blockchains or Google's certificate transparency logs. We present both theoretical and practical constructions using either witness encryption or trusted hardware (such as Intel SGX). Unlike previous works that either penalize an aborting party or achieve weaker notions such as $\\Delta$-fairness, we achieve complete fairness using existing infrastructure.",

        "title": "Capturing Malware Propagations with Code Injections and Code-Reuse Attacks",
        "abstract": "Defending against malware involves analysing large amounts of suspicious samples. To deal with such quantities we rely heavily on automatic approaches to determine whether a sample is malicious or not. Unfortunately, complete and precise automatic analysis of malware is far from an easy task. This is because malware is often designed to contain several techniques and countermeasures specifically to hinder analysis. One of these techniques is for the malware to propagate through the operating system so as to execute in the context of benign processes. The malware does this by writing memory to a given process and then proceeds to have this memory execute. In some cases these propagations are trivial to capture because they rely on well-known techniques. However, in the cases where malware deploys novel code injection techniques, rely on code-reuse attacks and potentially deploy dynamically generated code, the problem of capturing a complete and precise view of the malware execution is non-trivial. In this paper we present a unified approach to tracing malware propagations inside the host in the context of code injections and code-reuse attacks. We also present, to the knowledge of the authors, the first approach to identifying dynamically generated code based on information-flow analysis. We implement our techniques in a system called Tartarus and match Tartarus with both synthetic applications and real-world malware. We compare Tartarus to previous works and show that our techniques substantially improve the precision for collecting malware execution traces, and that our approach can capture intrinsic characteristics of novel code injection techniques.",

        "abstract": "Many popular modern processors include an important hardware security feature in the form of a DRTM (Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement) that helps bootstrap trust and resists software attacks. However, despite substantial body of prior research on trust establishment, security of DRTM was treated without involvement of the human user, who represents a vital missing link. The basic challenge is: how can a human user determine whether an expected DRTM is currently active on her device? In this paper, we define the notion of \"presence attestation\", which is based on mandatory, though minimal, user participation. We present three concrete presence attestation schemes: sight-based, location-based and scene-based. They vary in terms of security and usability features, and are suitable for different application contexts. After analyzing their security, we assess their usability and performance based on prototype implementations.",

        "abstract": "Tor provides low-latency anonymous and uncensored network access against a local or network adversary. Due to the design choice to minimize traffic overhead (and increase the pool of potential users) Tor allows some information about the client's connections to leak. Attacks using (features extracted from) this information to infer the website a user visits are called Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks. We develop a methodology and tools to measure the amount of leaked information about a website. We apply this tool to a comprehensive set of features extracted from a large set of websites and WF defense mechanisms, allowing us to make more fine-grained observations about WF attacks and defenses.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that Tor onion (hidden) service websites are particularly vulnerable to website fingerprinting attacks due to their limited number and sensitive nature. In this work we present a multi-level feature analysis of onion site fingerprintability, considering three state-of-the-art website fingerprinting methods and 482 Tor onion services, making this the largest analysis of this kind completed on onion services to date. Prior studies typically report average performance results for a given website fingerprinting method or countermeasure. We investigate which sites are more or less vulnerable to fingerprinting and which features make them so. We find that there is a high variability in the rate at which sites are classified (and misclassified) by these attacks, implying that average performance figures may not be informative of the risks that website fingerprinting attacks pose to particular sites. We analyze the features exploited by the different website fingerprinting methods and discuss what makes onion service sites more or less easily identifiable, both in terms of their traffic traces as well as their webpage design. We study misclassifications to understand how onion services sites can be redesigned to be less vulnerable to website fingerprinting attacks. Our results also inform the design of website fingerprinting countermeasures and their evaluation considering disparate impact across sites.",

        "abstract": "Mathematical constructs are necessary for computation on the underlying algebraic structures of cryptosystems. They are often written in assembly language and optimized manually for efficiency. We develop a certified technique to verify low-level mathematical constructs in X25519, the default elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol used in OpenSSH. Our technique translates an algebraic specification of mathematical constructs into an algebraic problem. The algebraic problem in turn is solved by the computer algebra system Singular. The proof assistant Coq certifies the translation and solution to algebraic problems. Specifications about output ranges and potential program overflows are translated to SMT problems and verified by SMT solvers. We report our case studies on verifying arithmetic computation over a large finite field and the Montgomery Ladderstep, a crucial loop in X25519.",

        "abstract": "Cloud computing has become an irreversible trend. Together comes the pressing need for verifiability, to assure the client the correctness of computation outsourced to the cloud. Existing verifiable computation techniques all have a high overhead, thus if being deployed in the clouds, would render cloud computing more expensive than the on-premises counterpart. To achieve verifiability at a reasonable cost, we leverage game theory and propose a smart contract based solution. In a nutshell, a client lets two clouds compute the same task, and uses smart contracts to stimulate tension, betrayal and distrust between the clouds, so that rational clouds will not collude and cheat. In the absence of collusion, verification of correctness can be done easily by crosschecking the results from the two clouds. We provide a formal analysis of the games induced by the contracts, and prove that the contracts will be effective under certain reasonable assumptions. By resorting to game theory and smart contracts, we are able to avoid heavy cryptographic protocols. The client only needs to pay two clouds to compute in the clear, and a small transaction fee to use the smart contracts. We also conducted a feasibility study that involves implementing the contracts in Solidity and running them on the official Ethereum network.",

        "abstract": "Jasmin is a framework for developing high-speed and high-assurance cryptographic software. The framework is structured around the Jasmin programming language and its compiler. The language is designed for enhancing portability of programs and for simplifying verification tasks. The compiler is designed to achieve predictability and efficiency of the output code (currently limited to x64 platforms), and is formally verified in the Coq proof assistant. Using the supercop framework, we evaluate the Jasmin compiler on representative cryptographic routines and conclude that the code generated by the compiler is as efficient as fast, hand-crafted, implementations. Moreover, the framework includes highly automated tools for proving memory safety and constant-time security (for protecting against cache-based timing attacks). We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the verification tools on a large set of cryptographic routines.",

Similar to traditional programs, SGX enclaves are likely to have security vulnerabilities and can be exploited as well. This gives an adversary a great opportunity to steal secret data or perform other malicious operations. Rust is one of the system programming languages with promising security properties. It has powerful checkers and guarantees memory-safety and thread-safety. In this paper, we show Rust SGX SDK, which combines Intel SGX and Rust programming language together. By using Rust SGX SDK, developers could write memory-safe secure enclaves easily, eliminating the most possibility of being pwned through memory vulnerabilities. What's more, the Rust enclaves are able to run as fast as the ones written in C/C++.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) is becoming a commodity. Numerous ML frameworks and services are available to data holders who are not ML experts but want to train predictive models on their data. It is important that ML models trained on sensitive inputs (e.g., personal images or documents) not leak too much information about the training data. We consider a malicious ML provider who supplies model-training code to the data holder, does \\emph{not} observe the training, but then obtains white- or black-box access to the resulting model. In this setting, we design and implement practical algorithms, some of them very similar to standard ML techniques such as regularization and data augmentation, that \"memorize\" information about the training dataset in the model\\textemdash yet the model is as accurate and predictive as a conventionally trained model. We then explain how the adversary can extract memorized information from the model. We evaluate our techniques on standard ML tasks for image classification (CIFAR10), face recognition (LFW and FaceScrub), and text analysis (20 Newsgroups and IMDB). In all cases, we show how our algorithms create models that have high predictive power yet allow accurate extraction of subsets of their training data.",

        "title": "Keep me Updated: An Empirical Study of Third-Party Library Updatability on Android",
        "abstract": "Third-party libraries in Android apps have repeatedly been shown to be hazards to the users' privacy and an amplification of their host apps' attack surface. A particularly aggravating factor to this situation is that the libraries' version included in apps are very often outdated. This paper makes the first contribution towards solving the problem of library outdatedness on Android. First, we conduct a survey with 203 app developers from Google Play to retrieve first-hand information about their usage of libraries and requirements for more effective library updates. With a subsequent study of library providers' semantic versioning practices, we uncover that those providers are likely a contributing factor to the app developers' abstinence from library updates in order to avoid ostensible re-integration efforts and version incompatibilities. Further, we conduct a large-scale library updatability analysis of 1,264,118 apps to show that, based on the library API usage, 85.6% of the libraries could be upgraded by at least one version without modifying the app code, 48.2% even to the latest version. Particularly alarming are our findings that 97.8% out of 16,837 actively used library versions with a known security vulnerability could be easily fixed through a drop-in replacement of the vulnerable library with the fixed version. Based on these results, we conclude with a thorough discussion of solutions and actionable items for different actors in the app ecosystem to effectively remedy this situation.",

        "abstract": "Certification of keys and attributes is in practice typically realized by a hierarchy of issuers. Revealing the full chain of issuers for certificate verification, however, can be a privacy issue since it can leak sensitive information about the issuer's organizational structure or about the certificate owner. Delegatable anonymous credentials solve this problem and allow one to hide the full delegation (issuance) chain, providing privacy during both delegation and presentation of certificates. However, the existing delegatable credentials schemes are not efficient enough for practical use. In this paper, we present the first hierarchical (or delegatable) anonymous credential system that is practical. To this end, we provide a surprisingly simple ideal functionality for delegatable credentials and present a generic construction that we prove secure in the UC model. We then give a concrete instantiation using a recent pairing-based signature scheme by Groth and describe a number of optimizations and efficiency improvements that can be made when implementing our concrete scheme. The latter might be of independent interest for other pairing-based schemes as well. Finally, we report on an implementation of our scheme in the context of transaction authentication for blockchain, and provide concrete performance figures.",

        "abstract": "Systems for verifiable outsourcing incur costs for a prover, a verifier, and precomputation; outsourcing makes sense when the combination of these costs is cheaper than not outsourcing. Yet, when prior works impose quantitative thresholds to analyze whether outsourcing is justified, they generally ignore prover costs. Verifiable ASICs (VA)---in which the prover is a custom chip---is the other way around: its cost calculations ignore precomputation. This paper describes a new VA system, called Giraffe; charges Giraffe for all three costs; and identifies regimes where outsourcing is worthwhile. Giraffe's base is an interactive proof geared to data-parallel computation. Giraffe makes this protocol asymptotically optimal for the prover and improves the verifier's main bottleneck by almost 3x, both of which are of independent interest. Giraffe also develops a design template that produces hardware designs automatically for a wide range of parameters, introduces hardware primitives molded to the protocol's data flows, and incorporates program analyses that expand applicability. Giraffe wins even when outsourcing several tens of sub-computations, scales to 500x larger computations than prior work, and can profitably outsource parts of programs that are not worthwhile to outsource in full.",

        "title": "JITGuard: Hardening Just-in-time Compilers with SGX",
        "abstract": "Memory-corruption vulnerabilities pose a serious threat to modern computer security. Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate code and data of vulnerable applications to generate malicious behavior by means of code-injection and code-reuse attacks. Researchers already demonstrated the power of data-only attacks by disclosing secret data such as cryptographic keys in the past. A large body of literature has investigated defenses against code-injection, code-reuse, and data-only attacks. Unfortunately, most of these defenses are tailored towards statically generated code and their adaption to dynamic code comes with the price of security or performance penalties. However, many common applications, like browsers and document viewers, embed just-in-time compilers to generate dynamic code. The contribution of this paper is twofold: first, we propose a generic data-only attack against JIT compilers, dubbed DOJITA. In contrast to previous data-only attacks that aimed at disclosing secret data, DOJITA enables arbitrary code-execution. Second, we propose JITGuard, a novel defense to mitigate code-injection, code-reuse, and data-only attacks against just-in-time compilers (including DOJITA). JITGuard utilizes Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to provide a secure environment for emitting the dynamic code to a secret region, which is only known to the JIT compiler, and hence, inaccessible to the attacker. Our proposal is the first solution leveraging SGX to protect the security critical JIT compiler operations, and tackles a number of difficult challenges. As proof of concept we implemented JITGuard for Firefox's JIT compiler SpiderMonkey. Our evaluation shows reasonable overhead of 9.8% for common benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Digitally signed malware can bypass system protection mechanisms that install or launch only programs with valid signatures. It can also evade anti-virus programs, which often forego scanning signed binaries. Known from advanced threats such as Stuxnet and Flame, this type of abuse has not been measured systematically in the broader malware landscape. In particular, the methods, effectiveness window, and security implications of code-signing PKI abuse are not well understood. We propose a threat model that highlights three types of weaknesses in the code-signing PKI. We overcome challenges specific to code-signing measurements by introducing techniques for prioritizing the collection of code signing certificates that are likely abusive. We also introduce an algorithm for distinguishing among different types of threats. These techniques allow us to study threats that breach the trust encoded in the Windows code signing PKI. The threats include stealing the private keys associated with benign certificates and using them to sign malware or by impersonating legitimate companies that do not develop software and, hence, do not own code-signing certificates. Finally, we discuss the actionable implications of our findings and propose concrete steps for improving the security of the code-signing ecosystem.",

        "abstract": "Logic locking has been conceived as a promising proactive defense strategy against intellectual property (IP) piracy, counterfeiting, hardware Trojans, reverse engineering, and overbuilding attacks. Yet, various attacks that use a working chip as an oracle have been launched on logic locking to successfully retrieve its secret key, undermining the defense of all existing locking techniques. In this paper, we propose stripped-functionality logic locking (SFLL), which strips some of the functionality of the design and hides it in the form of a secret key(s), thereby rendering on-chip implementation functionally different from the original one. When loaded onto an on-chip memory, the secret keys restore the original functionality of the design. Through security-aware synthesis that creates a controllable mismatch between the reverse-engineered netlist and original design, SFLL provides a quantifiable and provable resilience trade-off between all known and anticipated attacks. We demonstrate the application of SFLL to large designs (>100K gates) using a computer-aided design (CAD) framework that ensures attaining the desired security level at minimal implementation cost, 8%, 5%, and 0.5% for area, power, and delay, respectively. In addition to theoretical proofs and simulation confirmation of SFLL's security, we also report results from the silicon implementation of SFLL on an ARM Cortex-M0 microprocessor in 65nm technology.",

Our workflow description language allows for loops, non-deterministic choice, and an unbounded number of participating agents. The information flow policies are specified in a temporal logic for hyperproperties. We show that the verification problem can be reduced to the satisfiability of a formula of first-order linear-time temporal logic, and provide decidability results for relevant classes of workflows and specifications. We report on experimental results obtained with an implementation of our approach on a series of benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Noninterference is a popular semantic security condition because it offers strong end-to-end guarantees, it is inherently compositional, and it can be enforced using a simple security type system. Unfortunately, it is too restrictive for real systems. Mechanisms for downgrading information are needed to capture real-world security requirements, but downgrading eliminates the strong compositional security guarantees of noninterference. We introduce nonmalleable information flow, a new formal security condition that generalizes noninterference to permit controlled downgrading of both confidentiality and integrity. While previous work on robust declassification prevents adversaries from exploiting the downgrading of confidentiality, our key insight is transparent endorsement, a mechanism for downgrading integrity while defending against adversarial exploitation. Robust declassification appeared to break the duality of confidentiality and integrity by making confidentiality depend on integrity, but transparent endorsement makes integrity depend on confidentiality, restoring this duality. We show how to extend a security-typed programming language with transparent endorsement and prove that this static type system enforces nonmalleable information flow, a new security property that subsumes robust declassification and transparent endorsement. Finally, we describe an implementation of this type system in the context of Flame, a flow-limited authorization plugin for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.",

        "abstract": "Many machine learning methods make assumptions about the data, such as, data stationarity and data independence, for an efficient learning process that requires less data. However, these assumptions may give rise to vulnerabilities if violated by smart adversaries. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to craft the input samples by modifying a certain fraction of input features as small as in order to bypass the decision boundary of widely used binary classifiers using Support Vector Machine (SVM). We show that our algorithm can reliably produce adversarial samples which are misclassified with 98% success rate while modifying 22% of the input features on average. Our goal is to evaluate the robustness of classification algorithms for high demensional network data by intentionally performing evasion attacks with carefully designed adversarial examples. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using real network traffic datasets (CAIDA 2007 and CAIDA 2016).",

        "title": "A Large-Scale Empirical Study of Security Patches",
        "abstract": "Given how the \"patching treadmill\" plays a central role for enabling sites to counter emergent security concerns, it behooves the security community to understand the patch development process and characteristics of the resulting fixes. Illumination of the nature of security patch development can inform us of shortcomings in existing remediation processes and provide insights for improving current practices. In this work we conduct a large-scale empirical study of security patches, investigating more than 4,000 bug fixes for over 3,000 vulnerabilities that affected a diverse set of 682 open-source software projects. For our analysis we draw upon the National Vulnerability Database, information scraped from relevant external references, affected software repositories, and their associated security fixes. Leveraging this diverse set of information, we conduct an analysis of various aspects of the patch development life cycle, including investigation into the duration of impact a vulnerability has on a code base, the timeliness of patch development, and the degree to which developers produce safe and reliable fixes. We then characterize the nature of security fixes in comparison to other non-security bug fixes, exploring the complexity of different types of patches and their impact on code bases. Among our findings we identify that: security patches have a lower footprint in code bases than non-security bug patches; a third of all security issues were introduced more than 3 years prior to remediation; attackers who monitor open-source repositories can often get a jump of weeks to months on targeting not-yet-patched systems prior to any public disclosure and patch distribution; nearly 5% of security fixes negatively impacted the associated software; and 7% failed to completely remedy the security hole they targeted.",

It uses a broad range of unconventional signals from various public and private data sources and a set of signals forecasted via the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. While generating signals, auto cross correlation is used to find out the optimum signal aggregation and lead times. Generated signals are used to train a Bayesian classifier against the ground truth of each attack type. We show that it is possible to forecast future cyber incidents using CAPTURE and the consideration of the lead time could improve forecast performance.",

        "abstract": "Many network intrusion detection systems use byte sequences to detect lateral movements that exploit remote vulnerabilities. Attackers bypass such detection by stealing valid credentials and using them to transmit from one computer to another without creating abnormal network traffic. We call this method Credential-based Lateral Movement. To detect this type of lateral movement, we develop the concept of a Network Login Structure that specifies normal logins within a given network. Our method models a network login structure by automatically extracting a collection of login patterns by using a variation of the market-basket algorithm. We then employ an anomaly detection approach to detect malicious logins that are inconsistent with the enterprise network's login structure. Evaluations show that the proposed method is able to detect malicious logins in a real setting. In a simulated attack, our system was able to detect 82% of malicious logins, with a 0.3% false positive rate. We used a real dataset of millions of logins over the course of five months within a global financial company for evaluation of this work.",

        "title": "HexType: Efficient Detection of Type Confusion Errors for C++",
        "abstract": "Type confusion, often combined with use-after-free, is the main attack vector to compromise modern C++ software like browsers or virtual machines. Typecasting is a core principle that enables modularity in C++. For performance, most typecasts are only checked statically, i.e., the check only tests if a cast is allowed for the given type hierarchy, ignoring the actual runtime type of the object. Using an object of an incompatible base type instead of a derived type results in type confusion. Attackers abuse such type confusion issues to attack popular software products including Adobe Flash, PHP, Google Chrome, or Firefox. We propose to make all type checks explicit, replacing static checks with full runtime type checks. To minimize the performance impact of our mechanism HexType, we develop both low-overhead data structures and compiler optimizations. To maximize detection coverage, we handle specific object allocation patterns, e.g., placement new or reinterpret_cast which are not handled by other mechanisms. Our prototype results show that, compared to prior work, HexType has at least 1.1 -- 6.1 times higher coverage on Firefox benchmarks. For SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks with overhead, we show a 2 -- 33.4 times reduction in overhead. In addition, HexType discovered 4 new type confusion bugs in Qt and Apache Xerces-C++.",

        "title": "Key Reinstallation Attacks: Forcing Nonce Reuse in WPA2",
        "abstract": "We introduce the key reinstallation attack. This attack abuses design or implementation flaws in cryptographic protocols to reinstall an already-in-use key. This resets the key's associated parameters such as transmit nonces and receive replay counters. Several types of cryptographic Wi-Fi handshakes are affected by the attack. All protected Wi-Fi networks use the 4-way handshake to generate a fresh session key. So far, this 14-year-old handshake has remained free from attacks, and is even proven secure. However, we show that the 4-way handshake is vulnerable to a key reinstallation attack. Here, the adversary tricks a victim into reinstalling an already-in-use key. This is achieved by manipulating and replaying handshake messages. When reinstalling the key, associated parameters such as the incremental transmit packet number (nonce) and receive packet number (replay counter) are reset to their initial value. Our key reinstallation attack also breaks the PeerKey, group key, and Fast BSS Transition (FT) handshake. The impact depends on the handshake being attacked, and the data-confidentiality protocol in use. Simplified, against AES-CCMP an adversary can replay and decrypt (but not forge) packets. This makes it possible to hijack TCP streams and inject malicious data into them. Against WPA-TKIP and GCMP the impact is catastrophic: packets can be replayed, decrypted, and forged. Because GCMP uses the same authentication key in both communication directions, it is especially affected. Finally, we confirmed our findings in practice, and found that every Wi-Fi device is vulnerable to some variant of our attacks. Notably, our attack is exceptionally devastating against Android 6.0: it forces the client into using a predictable all-zero encryption key.",

        "abstract": "In cybersecurity, vulnerability discovery in source code is a fundamental problem. To automate vulnerability discovery, Machine learning (ML) based techniques has attracted tremendous attention. However, existing ML-based techniques focus on the component or file level detection, and thus considerable human effort is still required to pinpoint the vulnerable code fragments. Using source code files also limit the generalisability of the ML models across projects. To address such challenges, this paper targets at the function-level vulnerability discovery in the cross-project scenario. A function representation learning method is proposed to obtain the high-level and generalizable function representations from the abstract syntax tree (AST). First, the serialized ASTs are used to learn project independence features. Then, a customized bi-directional LSTM neural network is devised to learn the sequential AST representations from the large number of raw features. The new function-level representation demonstrated promising performance gain, using a unique dataset where we manually labeled 6000+ functions from three open-source projects. The results confirm that the huge potential of the new AST-based function representation learning.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, online payment systems play more and more important roles in people's daily lives. A key component of these systems is to detect and prevent fraud transactions. In industrial practice, such a task is separated into two phases: 1) mining evidential features to describe users, 2) building an effective model based on these features. Generally speaking, the most popular fraud transaction detection systems use elaborately designed features to build tree based models, sometimes a subsequent linear model is added to improve the behaviour. However, the designed features usually contains only static features, while dynamic features are not considered. In addition, the subsequent model can only learn a linear combination, which may always be unsatisfactory. To address these issues, we present a systematic method, which extracts not only users' static features but also dynamic features based on their recent behaviors. Moreover, N-GRAM model is employed to handle the dynamic features so that time series information is addressed. Based on the extracted features, a tree based model is applied and the outputs of it are regarded as new generated feature representations, which will be further inputted into a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to learn the complex relationships and form the final classification model. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model (with both static and dynamic features) significantly outperforms the existing methods.",

Recently, several attacks have been demonstrated against in-vehicle networks therefore drawing significant attention. This paper presents an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on a regression learning approach which estimates certain parameters by using correlated/redundant data. The estimated values are compared to observed ones to identify abnormal contexts that would indicate intrusion. Experiments performed with real-world vehicular data have shown that more than 90% of vehicle speed data can be precisely estimated within the error bound of 3 kph. The proposed IDS is capable of detecting and localizing attacks in real-time, which is fundamental to achieve automotive security.",

        "abstract": "Despite security advice in the official documentation and an extensive body of security research about vulnerabilities and exploits, many developers still fail to write secure Android applications. Frequently, Android developers fail to adhere to security best practices, leaving applications vulnerable to a multitude of attacks. We point out the advantage of a low-time-cost tool both to teach better secure coding and to improve app security. Using the FixDroid IDE plug-in, we show that professional and hobby app developers can work with and learn from an in-environment tool without it impacting their normal work; and by performing studies with both students and professional developers, we identify key UI requirements and demonstrate that code delivered with such a tool by developers previously inexperienced in security contains significantly less security problems. Perfecting and adding such tools to the Android development environment is an essential step in getting both security and privacy for the next generation of apps.",

        "abstract": "Current trends in SDN extend network programmability to the data plane through the use of programming languages such as P4. In this context, the chance of introducing errors and consequently software vulnerabilities in the network increases significantly. Existing data plane verification mechanisms are unable to model P4 programs or present severe restrictions in the set of modeled properties. To overcome these limitations and make programmable data planes more secure, we present a P4 program verification technique based on assertion checking and symbolic execution. First, P4 programs are annotated with assertions expressing general correctness and security properties. Then, the annotated programs are transformed into C code and all their possible paths are symbolically executed. Results show that it is possible to prove properties in just a few seconds using the proposed technique. Moreover, we were able to uncover two potential vulnerabilities in a large scale P4 production application.",

        "abstract": "Content delivery network (CDN) has been playing an important role in accelerating users' visit speed, bring good experience for popular web sites around the world. It has become a common security enhance service for CDN providers to offer HTTPS support to tenants. When several tenants are deployed to share a same IP address due to resource efficiency and cost, CDN providers should make comprehensive settings to ensure that all tenants' sites work correctly on users' requests. Otherwise, issues can take place such as denial of service (DOS) and privacy leakage, causing very bad user experience to users as well as potential economic loss for tenants, especially under the situation of hybrid deployment of HTTP and HTTPS. We examine the deployments of typical multi-tenant CDN providers by active measurement and find that CDN providers, namely Akaimai and ChinaCenter, have configuration problems which can result in DOS by certificate name mismatch error. Several advices are given to help to mitigate the issue. We believe that our study is meaningful for improving the security and the robustness of CDN.",

        "abstract": "Malicious crowdsourcing forums are gaining traction as sources of spreading misinformation online, but are limited by the costs of hiring and managing human workers. In this paper, we identify a new class of attacks that leverage deep learning language models (Recurrent Neural Networks or RNNs) to automate the generation of fake online reviews for products and services. Not only are these attacks cheap and therefore more scalable, but they can control rate of content output to eliminate the signature burstiness that makes crowdsourced campaigns easy to detect. Using Yelp reviews as an example platform, we show how a two phased review generation and customization attack can produce reviews that are indistinguishable by state-of-the-art statistical detectors. We conduct a survey-based user study to show these reviews not only evade human detection, but also score high on \"usefulness\" metrics by users. Finally, we develop novel automated defenses against these attacks, by leveraging the lossy transformation introduced by the RNN training and generation cycle. We consider countermeasures against our mechanisms, show that they produce unattractive cost-benefit tradeoffs for attackers, and that they can be further curtailed by simple constraints imposed by online service providers.",

        "title": "Compressive Traffic Analysis: A New Paradigm for Scalable Traffic Analysis",
        "abstract": "Traffic analysis is the practice of inferring sensitive information from communication patterns, particularly packet timings and packet sizes. Traffic analysis is increasingly becoming relevant to security and privacy with the growing use of encryption and other evasion techniques that render content-based analysis of network traffic impossible. The literature has investigated traffic analysis for various application scenarios, from tracking stepping stone cybercriminals to compromising anonymity systems. The major challenge to existing traffic analysis mechanisms is scaling to today's exploding volumes of network traffic, i.e., they impose high storage, communications, and computation overheads. In this paper, we aim at addressing this scalability issue by introducing a new direction for traffic analysis, which we call \\emph{compressive traffic analysis}. The core idea of compressive traffic analysis is to compress traffic features, and perform traffic analysis operations on such compressed features instead of on raw traffic features (therefore, improving the storage, communications, and computation overheads of traffic analysis due to using smaller numbers of features). To compress traffic features, compressive traffic analysis leverages linear projection algorithms from compressed sensing, an active area within signal processing. We show that these algorithms offer unique properties that enable compressing network traffic features while preserving the performance of traffic analysis compared to traditional mechanisms. We introduce the idea of compressive traffic analysis as a new generic framework for scalable traffic analysis. We then apply compressive traffic analysis to two widely studied classes of traffic analysis, namely, flow correlation and website fingerprinting. We show that the compressive versions of state-of-the-art flow correlation and website fingerprinting schemes\\textemdash significantly\\textemdash outperform their non-compressive (traditional) alternatives, e.g., the compressive version of Houmansadr et al. [44]'s flow correlation is two orders of magnitude faster, and the compressive version of Wang et al. [77] fingerprinting system runs about 13 times faster. We believe that our study is a major step towards scaling traffic analysis.",

        "abstract": "Modern smartphones popularly adopt a small touch sensor for fingerprint identification of a user, but it captures only a partial limited portion of a fingerprint. Recently we have studied a gap between actual risk and user perception of latent fingerprints remaining on a smartphone, and developed a fake fingerprint attack that exploits the latent fingerprints as actual risk. We successfully reconstructed a fake fingerprint image in good quality for small touch sensors. In this paper, we subsequently conduct post hoc experimental studies on the facts that we have missed or have since learned. First of all, we examine that the presented attack is not conceptual but realistic. We employ the reconstructed image and make its fake fingerprint, using a conductive printing or a silicon-like glue, to pass directly the touch sensor of real smartphones. Our target smartphones are Samsung Galaxy S6, S7 and iPhone 5s, 6, 7. Indeed we have succeeded in passing Galaxy S6, S7, and now work on the remaining smartphones. We also conduct an experimental study for one of our mitigation methods to see how it can reduce actual risk. Finally, we perform a user survey study to understand user perception on the fake fingerprint attacks and the mitigation methods.",

        "abstract": "Blockchains and more general distributed ledgers are becoming increasingly popular as efficient, reliable, and persistent records of data and transactions. Unfortunately, they ensure reliability and correctness by making all data public, raising confidentiality concerns that eliminate many potential uses. In this paper we present Solidus, a protocol for confidential transactions on public blockchains, such as those required for asset transfers with on-chain settlement. Solidus operates in a framework based on real-world financial institutions: a modest number of banks each maintain a large number of user accounts. Within this framework, Solidus hides both transaction values and the transaction graph (i.e., the identities of transacting entities) while maintaining the public verifiability that makes blockchains so appealing. To achieve strong confidentiality of this kind, we introduce the concept of a Publicly-Verifiable Oblivious RAM Machine (PVORM). We present a set of formal security definitions for both PVORM and Solidus and show that our constructions are secure. Finally, we implement Solidus and present a set of benchmarks indicating that the system is efficient in practice.",

        "title": "Tutorial: Private Information Retrieval",
        "abstract": "Private information retrieval (PIR) is a cryptographic primitive that facilitates the seemingly impossible task of letting users fetch records from untrusted and remote database servers without revealing to those servers which records are being fetched. The research literature on PIR is vast; in the over two decades since its 1995 introduction by Chor, Goldreich, Kushilevitz, and Sudan, the cryptography, privacy, and theoretical computer science research communities have studied PIR intensively and from a variety of perspectives. Alas, despite a series of significant advances, most privacy practitioners and theoreticians alike fall into one of two camps: (i) those who believe that PIR is so inefficient and abstruse as to make it all-but-useless in practice, and (ii) those who remain blissfully unaware that PIR even exists. Indeed, to date not even one of the numerous PIR-based applications proposed in the research literature has been deployed at scale to protect the privacy of users \"in the wild\". This tutorial targets both of the above camps, presenting a bird's-eye overview of the current state of PIR research. Topics covered will span the spectrum from purely theoretical through imminently applicable and all the high points in between, thereby providing participants with an awareness of what modern PIR techniques have (and do not have) to offer, dispelling the myth of PIR's inherent impracticality, and hopefully inspiring participants to identify practical use cases for PIR within their own niche areas of expertise. This introductory tutorial will be accessible to anyone comfortable with college-level mathematics (basic linear algebra and some elementary probability and number theory).",

        "abstract": "Graph modeling allows numerous security problems to be tackled in a general way, however, little work has been done to understand their ability to withstand adversarial attacks. We design and evaluate two novel graph attacks against a state-of-the-art network-level, graph-based detection system. Our work highlights areas in adversarial machine learning that have not yet been addressed, specifically: graph-based clustering techniques, and a global feature space where realistic attackers without perfect knowledge must be accounted for (by the defenders) in order to be practical. Even though less informed attackers can evade graph clustering with low cost, we show that some practical defenses are possible.",

        "abstract": "Grey-box fuzzing is a random testing technique that has been shown to be effective at finding security vulnerabilities in software. The technique leverages program instrumentation to gather information about the program with the goal of increasing the code coverage during fuzzing, which makes gray-box fuzzers extremely efficient vulnerability detection tools. One such tool is AFL, a grey-box fuzzer for C programs that has been used successfully to find security vulnerabilities and other critical defects in countless software products. We present Kelinci, a tool that interfaces AFL with instrumented Java programs. The tool does not require modifications to AFL and is easily parallelizable. Applying AFL-type fuzzing to Java programs opens up the possibility of testing Java based applications using this powerful technique. We show the effectiveness of Kelinci by applying it on the image processing library Apache Commons Imaging, in which it identified a bug within one hour.",

This extends both source-aware and source-free CFI and SFI technologies to a large class of previously unsupported software: those containing immutable system modules with large, object-oriented APIs---which are particularly common in component-based, event-driven consumer software. It also helps to protect these inter-module object exchanges against confused deputy-assisted vtable corruption and counterfeit object-oriented programming attacks. A prototype implementation for Microsoft Component Object Model demonstrates that OFI is scalable to large interfaces on the order of tens of thousands of methods, and exhibits low overheads of under 1% for some common-case applications. Significant elements of the implementation are synthesized automatically through a principled design inspired by type-based contracts.",

        "title": "Deep Models Under the GAN: Information Leakage from Collaborative Deep Learning",
        "abstract": "Deep Learning has recently become hugely popular in machine learning for its ability to solve end-to-end learning systems, in which the features and the classifiers are learned simultaneously, providing significant improvements in classification accuracy in the presence of highly-structured and large databases. Its success is due to a combination of recent algorithmic breakthroughs, increasingly powerful computers, and access to significant amounts of data. Researchers have also considered privacy implications of deep learning. Models are typically trained in a centralized manner with all the data being processed by the same training algorithm. If the data is a collection of users' private data, including habits, personal pictures, geographical positions, interests, and more, the centralized server will have access to sensitive information that could potentially be mishandled. To tackle this problem, collaborative deep learning models have recently been proposed where parties locally train their deep learning structures and only share a subset of the parameters in the attempt to keep their respective training sets private. Parameters can also be obfuscated via differential privacy (DP) to make information extraction even more challenging, as proposed by Shokri and Shmatikov at CCS'15. Unfortunately, we show that any privacy-preserving collaborative deep learning is susceptible to a powerful attack that we devise in this paper. In particular, we show that a distributed, federated, or decentralized deep learning approach is fundamentally broken and does not protect the training sets of honest participants. The attack we developed exploits the real-time nature of the learning process that allows the adversary to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that generates prototypical samples of the targeted training set that was meant to be private (the samples generated by the GAN are intended to come from the same distribution as the training data). Interestingly, we show that record-level differential privacy applied to the shared parameters of the model, as suggested in previous work, is ineffective (i.e., record-level DP is not designed to address our attack).",

        "title": "LightBox: Full-stack Protected Stateful Middlebox at Lightning Speed",
        "abstract": "Running off-site software middleboxes at third-party service providers has been a popular practice. However, routing large volumes of raw traffic, which may carry sensitive information, to a remote site for processing raises severe security concerns. Prior solutions often abstract away important factors pertinent to real-world deployment. In particular, they overlook the significance of metadata protection and stateful processing. Unprotected traffic metadata like low-level headers, size and count, can be exploited to learn supposedly encrypted application contents. Meanwhile, tracking the states of 100,000s of flows concurrently is often indispensable in production-level middleboxes deployed at real networks. We present LightBox, the first system that can drive off-site middleboxes at near-native speed with stateful processing and the most comprehensive protection to date. Built upon commodity trusted hardware, Intel SGX, LightBox is the product of our systematic investigation of how to overcome the inherent limitations of secure enclaves using domain knowledge and customization. First, we introduce an elegant virtual network interface that allows convenient access to fully protected packets at line rate without leaving the enclave, as if from the trusted source network. Second, we provide complete flow state management for efficient stateful processing, by tailoring a set of data structures and algorithms optimized for the highly constrained enclave space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that LightBox, with all security benefits, can achieve 10Gbps packet I/O, and that with case studies on three stateful middleboxes, it can operate at near-native speed.",

We then present Quantitative Cartesian Hoare Logic (QCHL), a program logic for verifying epsilon-bounded non-interference. Our tool, Themis, combines automated reasoning in CHL with lightweight static taint analysis to improve scalability. We evaluate Themis on well known Java applications and demonstrate that Themis can find unknown side-channel vulnerabilities in widely-used programs. We also show that Themis can verify the absence of vulnerabilities in repaired versions of vulnerable programs and that Themis compares favorably against Blazer, a state-of-the-art static analysis tool for finding timing side channels in Java applications.",

That proof composes with an existing C compiler correctness proof to guarantee, end-to-end, that the machine language program gives strong pseudorandomness. All proofs (hybrid games, C program verification, compiler, and their composition) are machine-checked in the Coq proof assistant. Our proofs are modular: the hybrid game proof holds on any implementation of HMAC-DRBG that satisfies our functional specification. Therefore, our functional specification can serve as a high-assurance reference.",

        "title": "Code-Reuse Attacks for the Web: Breaking Cross-Site Scripting Mitigations via Script Gadgets",
        "abstract": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is an unremitting problem for the Web. Since its initial public documentation in 2000 until now, XSS has been continuously on top of the vulnerability statistics. Even though there has been a considerable amount of research and developer education to address XSS on the source code level, the overall number of discovered XSS problems remains high. Because of this, various approaches to mitigate XSS have been proposed as a second line of defense, with HTML sanitizers, Web Application Firewalls, browser-based XSS filters, and the Content Security Policy being some prominent examples. Most of these mechanisms focus on script tags and event handlers, either by removing them from user-provided content or by preventing their script code from executing. In this paper, we demonstrate that this approach is no longer sufficient for modern applications: We describe a novel Web attack that can circumvent all of theses currently existing XSS mitigation techniques. In this attack, the attacker abuses so called script gadgets (legitimate JavaScript fragments within an application's legitimate code base) to execute JavaScript. In most cases, these gadgets utilize DOM selectors to interact with elements in the Web document. Through an initial injection point, the attacker can inject benign-looking HTML elements which are ignored by these mitigation techniques but match the selector of the gadget. This way, the attacker can hijack the input of a gadget and cause processing of his input, which in turn leads to code execution of attacker-controlled values. We demonstrate that these gadgets are omnipresent in almost all modern JavaScript frameworks and present an empirical study showing the prevalence of script gadgets in productive code. As a result, we assume most mitigation techniques in web applications written today can be bypassed.",

        "title": "DEFTL: Implementing Plausibly Deniable Encryption in Flash Translation Layer",
        "abstract": "Mobile devices today have been increasingly used to store and process sensitive information. To protect sensitive data, mobile operating systems usually incorporate a certain level of encryption to protect sensitive data. However, conventional encryption cannot defend against a coercive attacker who can capture the device owner, and force the owner to disclose keys used for decrypting sensitive information. To defend against such a coercive adversary, Plausibly Deniable Encryption (PDE) was introduced to allow the device owner to deny the very existence of sensitive data stored on his/her device. The existing PDE systems, built on flash storage devices, are problematic, since they either neglect the special nature of the underlying storage medium (which is usually NAND flash), or suffer from deniability compromises. In this paper, we propose DEFTL, a Deniability Enabling Flash Translation Layer for devices which use flash-based block devices as storage media. DEFTL is the first PDE design which incorporates deniability to Flash Translation Layer (FTL), a pervasively deployed \"translation layer\" which stays between NAND flash and the file system in literally all the computing devices. A salient advantage of DEFTL lies in its capability of achieving deniability while being able to accommodate the special nature of NAND flash as well as eliminate deniability compromises from it. We implement DEFTL using an open-source NAND flash controller. The experimental results show that, compared to conventional encryption which does not provide deniability, our DEFTL design only incurs a small overhead.",

        "title": "Let's Go in for a Closer Look: Observing Passwords in Their Natural Habitat",
        "abstract": "Text passwords---a frequent vector for account compromise, yet still ubiquitous---have been studied for decades by researchers attempting to determine how to coerce users to create passwords that are hard for attackers to guess but still easy for users to type and memorize. Most studies examine one password or a small number of passwords per user, and studies often rely on passwords created solely for the purpose of the study or on passwords protecting low-value accounts. These limitations severely constrain our understanding of password security in practice, including the extent and nature of password reuse, password behaviors specific to categories of accounts (e.g., financial websites), and the effect of password managers and other privacy tools. In this paper we report on an in situ study of 154 participants over an average of 147 days each. Participants' computers were instrumented---with careful attention to privacy---to record detailed information about password characteristics and usage, as well as man other computing behaviors such as use of security and privacy web browser extensions. This data allows a more accurate analysis of password characteristics and behaviors across the full range of participants' web-based accounts. Examples of our findings are that the use of symbols and digits in passwords predicts increased likelihood of reuse, while increased password strength predicts decreased likelihood of reuse; that password reuse is more prevalent than previously believed, especially when partial reuse is taken into account; and that password managers may have no impact on password reuse or strength. We also observe that users can be grouped into a handful of behavioral clusters, representative of various password management strategies. Our findings suggest that once a user needs to manage a larger number of passwords, they cope by partially and exactly reusing passwords across most of their accounts.",

        "abstract": "We propose a new, constant-round protocol for multi-party computation of boolean circuits that is secure against an arbitrary number of malicious corruptions. At a high level, we extend and generalize recent work of Wang et al. in the two-party setting. Namely, we design an efficient preprocessing phase that allows the parties to generate authenticated information; we then show how to use this information to distributively construct a single \"authenticated\" garbled circuit that is evaluated by one party. Our resulting protocol improves upon the state-of-the-art both asymptotically and concretely. We validate these claims via several experiments demonstrating both the efficiency and scalability of our protocol: Efficiency: For three-party computation over a LAN, our protocol requires only 95 ms to evaluate AES. This is roughly a 700X improvement over the best prior work, and only 2.5X slower than the best known result in the two-party setting. In general, for n-party computation our protocol improves upon prior work (which was never implemented) by a factor of more than 230n, e.g., an improvement of 3 orders of magnitude for 5-party computation. Scalability: We successfully executed our protocol with a large number of parties located all over the world, computing (for example) AES with 128 parties across 5 continents in under 3 minutes. Our work represents the largest-scale demonstration of secure computation to date.",

However, the potential risk of centralized authority abuse and the fragile infrastructure may lead a sluggish deployment of such BGP security approach currently. We propose BGPCoin, a trustworthy blockchain-based Internet resource management solution which provides compliant resource allocations and revocations, and a reliable origin advertisement source. By means of a smart contract to perform and supervise resource assignments on the tamper-resistant Ethereum blockchain, BGPCoin yields significant benefits in the secure origin advertisement and the dependable infrastructure for object repository compared with RPKI. We demonstrate through an Ethereum prototype implementation that the deployment incentives and increased security are technically and economically viable.",

        "abstract": "With the widespread use of SSL, many issues have been exposed as well. Forged certificates used for MITM attacks or proxies can make SSL encryption useless easily, leading to privacy disclosure and property loss of careless victims. In this paper, we implement a large scale of passive measurement of SSL/TLS and analyze the forged certificates in the wild comprehensively. We measured SSL/TLS connection for 16 months on two large research networks, which provided a total of 100 Gbps bandwidth. We gathered nearly 135 million leaf certificates and studied the forged ones. Our findings reveal main reasons of signing forged certificates, and show the preference of them. Finally, we find out several suspicious servers that might be used for MITM.",

        "abstract": "The TLS protocol is intended to enable secure end-to-end communication over insecure networks, including the Internet. Unfortunately, this goal has been thwarted a number of times throughout the protocol's tumultuous lifetime, resulting in the need for a new version of the protocol, namely TLS 1.3. Over the past three years, in an unprecedented joint design effort with the academic community, the TLS Working Group has been working tirelessly to enhance the security of TLS. We further this effort by constructing the most comprehensive, faithful, and modular symbolic model of the TLS~1.3 draft 21 release candidate, and use the TAMARIN prover to verify the claimed TLS~1.3 security requirements, as laid out in draft 21 of the specification. In particular, our model covers all handshake modes of TLS 1.3. Our analysis reveals an unexpected behaviour, which we expect will inhibit strong authentication guarantees in some implementations of the protocol. In contrast to previous models, we provide a novel way of making the relation between the TLS specification and our model explicit: we provide a fully annotated version of the specification that clarifies what protocol elements we modelled, and precisely how we modelled these elements. We anticipate this model artifact to be of great benefit to the academic community and the TLS Working Group alike.",

        "abstract": "The recently proposed file-injection type attacks are highlighting the importance of forward security in dynamic searchable symmetric encryption (DSSE). Forward security enables to thwart those attacks by hiding the information about the newly added files matching a previous search query. However, there are still only a few DSSE schemes that provide forward security, and they have factors that hinder efficiency. In particular, all of these schemes do not support actual data deletion, which increments both storage space and computational complexity. In this paper, we design and implement a forward secure DSSE scheme with optimal search and update complexity, for both computation and communication point of view. As a starting point, we propose a new, simple, theoretical data structure, called dual dictionary that can take advantage of both the inverted and the forward indexes at the same time. This data structure allows to delete data explicitly and in real time, which greatly improves efficiency compared to previous works. In addition, our scheme provides forward security by encrypting the newly added data with fresh keys not related with the previous search tokens. We implemented our scheme for Enron email and Wikipedia datasets and measured its performance. The comparison with Sophos shows that our scheme is very efficient in practice, for both searches and updates in dynamic environments.",

        "abstract": "As a critical feature for enhancing user experience, cross-app URL invocation has been reported to cause unauthorized execution of app components. Although protection has already been put in place, little has been done to understand the security risks of navigating an app's WebView through an URL, a legitimate need for displaying the app's UI during cross-app interactions. In our research, we found that the current design of such cross-WebView navigation actually opens the door to a cross-app remote infection, allowing a remote adversary to spread malicious web content across different apps' WebView instances and acquire stealthy and persistent control of these apps. This new threat, dubbed Cross-App WebView Infection (XAWI), enables a series of multi-app, colluding attacks never thought before, with significant real world impacts. Particularly, we found that the remote adversary can collectively utilize multiple infected apps' individual capabilities to escalate his privileges on a mobile device or orchestrate a highly realistic remote Phishing attack (e.g., running a malicious script in Chrome to stealthily change Twitter's WebView to fake Twitter's own login UI). We show that the adversary can easily find such attack \"building blocks\" (popular apps whose WebViews can be redirected by another app) through an automatic fuzz, and discovered about 7.4% of the most popular apps subject to the XAWI attacks, including Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and others. Our study reveals the contention between the demand for convenient cross-WebView communication and the need for security control on the channel, and makes the first step toward building OS-level protection to safeguard this fast-growing technology.",

        "abstract": "Speech recognition (SR) systems such as Siri or Google Now have become an increasingly popular human-computer interaction method, and have turned various systems into voice controllable systems (VCS). Prior work on attacking VCS shows that the hidden voice commands that are incomprehensible to people can control the systems. Hidden voice commands, though \"hidden\", are nonetheless audible. In this work, we design a totally inaudible attack, DolphinAttack, that modulates voice commands on ultrasonic carriers (e.g., f > 20 kHz) to achieve inaudibility. By leveraging the nonlinearity of the microphone circuits, the modulated low-frequency audio commands can be successfully demodulated, recovered, and more importantly interpreted by the speech recognition systems. We validated DolphinAttack on popular speech recognition systems, including Siri, Google Now, Samsung S Voice, Huawei HiVoice, Cortana and Alexa. By injecting a sequence of inaudible voice commands, we show a few proof-of-concept attacks, which include activating Siri to initiate a FaceTime call on iPhone, activating Google Now to switch the phone to the airplane mode, and even manipulating the navigation system in an Audi automobile. We propose hardware and software defense solutions, and suggest to re-design voice controllable systems to be resilient to inaudible voice command attacks.",

        "title": "Workshop on Multimedia Privacy and Security",
        "abstract": "This workshop addresses the technical challenges arising from our current interconnected society. Multitudes of devices and people can be connected to each other by intelligent algorithms, apps, social networks, and the infrastructure set by Internet of Things (IoT). As more people and their devices are connected without much restriction, the issues of security, privacy, and trust remain a challenge. Multimedia in IoT services should provide a robust and resilient security platforms and solutions against any unauthorized access. Recent literature shows increased concerns about hacking, security breaches, data manipulation, social engineering, and new attack methods. Malware can be hidden within multimedia files and visiting infected websites can trigger its download to victims' machines. There are a multitude of techniques to steal personal information and other sensitive media for unauthorized dissemination; imposters/identity thefts are common in social networks. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of resilient security and privacy solutions, methods such as new standards, advance cryptography, improved algorithms for intrusion detection, personalized privacy, and isolation of questionable or malicious files can be used independently or all together to minimize the threats. Multimedia has expanded beyond the scope its original definition. With the rise of social media, large quantities of multimedia (e.g., pictures, videos, data, analytics and personal information) can be created in a short period of time. When all these data are stored in a cloud environment, many people can connect to these services for viewing, sharing, commenting, and storing information. IoT represents a collection of devices, platforms, and software that allow people to store and share data in the cloud and also connects different types of clouds altogether. Hence, multimedia in the IoT serves a significant purpose as many people's updates, status, locations, and live actions can be seen, disseminated, tracked, commented on, and monitored in near real time. IoT opens up many possibilities since more people can broadcast themselves and allow their networks to view and share in their lives. There are also increased fraudulent activities, cybercrimes, unauthorized access, malicious attacks, phishing, and impersonating/stealing identities. This presents challenges for existing areas such as access control, authentication, data leakage, permission, social engineering, denial of service, and identity management for the attackers to impose identity, steal information, and manipulate data in the IoT environment. Challenges also include new problems such as large scale attacks and prevention, the strength of security protection (e.g., common encryption algorithms), hiding malware with multimedia, location-based privacy with high accuracy and anonymity, underground criminal networks, and hidden security breaches. Our workshopl, The 1st International Workshop on Multimedia Privacy and Security (MPS), as part of CCS 2017, focuses on these concerns, specific to the IoT ecosystem. We solicited submissions on new and innovative methods, techniques, and proofs of concepts supported by strong theory/algorithms and simulation/experiments to submit papers for this workshop. We accepted 5 submissions, and organized the workshop around talks for these publications with a keynote from Dr. Jeremy Epstein of the NSF and a panel discussion.",

        "abstract": "We present Clio, an information flow control (IFC) system that transparently incorporates cryptography to enforce confidentiality and integrity policies on untrusted storage. Clio insulates developers from explicitly manipulating keys and cryptographic primitives by leveraging the policy language of the IFC system to automatically use the appropriate keys and correct cryptographic operations. We prove that Clio is secure with a novel proof technique that is based on a proof style from cryptography together with standard programming languages results. We present a prototype Clio implementation and a case study that demonstrates Clio's practicality.",

        "abstract": "The power capacity of multi-tenant data centers is typically oversubscribed in order to increase the utilization of expensive power infrastructure. This practice can create dangerous situations and compromise data center availability if the designed power capacity is exceeded. This paper demonstrates that current safeguards are vulnerable to well-timed power attacks launched by malicious tenants (i.e., attackers). Further, we demonstrate that there is a physical side channel --- a thermal side channel due to hot air recirculation --- that contains information about the benign tenants' runtime power usage and can enable a malicious tenant to time power attacks effectively. In particular, we design a state-augmented Kalman filter to extract this information from the side channel and guide an attacker to use its maximum power at moments that coincide with the benign tenants' high power demand, thus overloading the shared power capacity. Our experimental results show that an attacker can capture 54% of all attack opportunities, significantly compromising the data center availability. Finally, we discuss a set of possible defense strategies to safeguard the data center infrastructure against power attacks.",

Bellare, Paterson, and Rogaway provided at CRYPTO '14 a formal security model to capture this kind of attacks and constructed practically implementable ASAs against a large class of symmetric encryption schemes. At CCS'15, Ateniese, Magri, and Venturi extended this model to allow the attackers to work in a fully-adaptive and continuous fashion and proposed subversion attacks against digital signature schemes. Both papers also showed the impossibility of ASAs in cases where the cryptographic tools are deterministic. Also at CCS'15, Bellare, Jaeger, and Kane strengthened the original model and proposed a universal ASA against sufficiently random encryption schemes. In this paper we analyze ASAs from the perspective of steganography - the well known concept of hiding the presence of secret messages in legal communications. While a close connection between ASAs and steganography is known, this lacks a rigorous treatment. We consider the common computational model for secret-key steganography and prove that successful ASAs correspond to secure stegosystems on certain channels and vice versa. This formal proof allows us to conclude that ASAs are stegosystems and to \"rediscover\" several results concerning ASAs known in the steganographic literature.",

        "title": "FreeGuard: A Faster Secure Heap Allocator",
        "abstract": "In spite of years of improvements to software security, heap-related attacks still remain a severe threat. One reason is that many existing memory allocators fall short in a variety of aspects. For instance, performance-oriented allocators are designed with very limited countermeasures against attacks, but secure allocators generally suffer from significant performance overhead, e.g., running up to 10x slower. This paper, therefore, introduces FreeGuard, a secure memory allocator that prevents or reduces a wide range of heap-related security attacks, such as heap overflows, heap over-reads, use-after-frees, as well as double and invalid frees. FreeGuard has similar performance to the default Linux allocator, with less than 2% overhead on average, but provides significant improvement to security guarantees.",

        "abstract": "Side-channel risks of Intel SGX have recently attracted great attention. Under the spotlight is the newly discovered page-fault attack, in which an OS-level adversary induces page faults to observe the page-level access patterns of a protected process running in an SGX enclave. With almost all proposed defense focusing on this attack, little is known about whether such efforts indeed raise the bar for the adversary, whether a simple variation of the attack renders all protection ineffective, not to mention an in-depth understanding of other attack surfaces in the SGX system. In the paper, we report the first step toward systematic analyses of side-channel threats that SGX faces, focusing on the risks associated with its memory management. Our research identifies 8 potential attack vectors, ranging from TLB to DRAM modules. More importantly, we highlight the common misunderstandings about SGX memory side channels, demonstrating that high frequent AEXs can be avoided when recovering EdDSA secret key through a new page channel and fine-grained monitoring of enclave programs (at the level of 64B) can be done through combining both cache and cross-enclave DRAM channels. Our findings reveal the gap between the ongoing security research on SGX and its side-channel weaknesses, redefine the side-channel threat model for secure enclaves, and can provoke a discussion on when to use such a system and how to use it securely.",

        "title": "AUTHSCOPE: Towards Automatic Discovery of Vulnerable Authorizations in Online Services",
        "abstract": "When accessing online private resources (e.g., user profiles, photos, shopping carts) from a client (e.g., a desktop web-browser or a mobile app), the service providers must implement proper access control, which typically involves both authentication and authorization. However, not all of the service providers follow the best practice, resulting in various access control vulnerabilities. To understand such a threat in a large scale, and identify the vulnerable access control implementations in online services, this paper introduces AuthScope, a tool that is able to automatically execute a mobile app and pinpoint the vulnerable access control implementations, particularly the vulnerable authorizations, in the corresponding online service. The key idea is to use differential traffic analysis to recognize the protocol fields and then automatically substitute the fields and observe the server response. One of the key challenges for a large scale study lies in how to obtain the post-authentication request-and-response messages for a given app. We have thus developed a targeted dynamic activity explorer to perform an in-context analysis and drive the app execution to automatically log in the service. We have tested AuthScope with 4,838 popular mobile apps from Google Play, and identified 597 0-day vulnerable authorizations that map to 306 apps.",

        "title": "Quantifying the Pressure of Legal Risks on Third-party Vulnerability Research",
        "abstract": "Product vendors and vulnerability researchers work with the same underlying artifacts, but can be motivated by goals that are distinct and, at times, disjoint. This potential for conflict, coupled with the legal instruments available to product vendors (e.g., EULAs, DMCA, CFAA, etc.) drive a broad concern that there are \"chilling effects\" that dissuade vulnerability researchers from vigorously evaluating product security. Indeed, there are well-known examples of legal action taken against individual researchers. However, these are inherently anecdotal in nature and skeptics of the chilling-effects hypothesis argue that there is no systematic evidence to justify such concerns. This paper is motivated by precisely this tussle. We present some of the first work to address this issue on a quantitative and empirical footing, illuminating the sentiments of both product vendors and vulnerability researchers. First, we canvas a range of product companies for explicit permission to conduct security assessments and thus characterize the degree to which the broad software vendor community is supportive of vulnerability research activities and how this varies based on the nature of the researcher. Second, we conduct an online sentiment survey of vulnerability researchers to understand the extent to which they have abstract concerns or concrete experience with legal threats and the extent to which this mindset shapes their choices.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning has shown impressive performance on hard perceptual problems. However, researchers found deep learning systems to be vulnerable to small, specially crafted perturbations that are imperceptible to humans. Such perturbations cause deep learning systems to mis-classify adversarial examples, with potentially disastrous consequences where safety or security is crucial. Prior defenses against adversarial examples either targeted specific attacks or were shown to be ineffective. We propose MagNet, a framework for defending neural network classifiers against adversarial examples. MagNet neither modifies the protected classifier nor requires knowledge of the process for generating adversarial examples. MagNet includes one or more separate detector networks and a reformer network. The detector networks learn to differentiate between normal and adversarial examples by approximating the manifold of normal examples. Since they assume no specific process for generating adversarial examples, they generalize well. The reformer network moves adversarial examples towards the manifold of normal examples, which is effective for correctly classifying adversarial examples with small perturbation. We discuss the intrinsic difficulties in defending against whitebox attack and propose a mechanism to defend against graybox attack. Inspired by the use of randomness in cryptography, we use diversity to strengthen MagNet. We show empirically that MagNet is effective against the most advanced state-of-the-art attacks in blackbox and graybox scenarios without sacrificing false positive rate on normal examples.",

        "abstract": "Time-based one-time password (TOTP) systems in use today require storing secrets on both the client and the server. As a result, an attack on the server can expose all second factors for all users in the system. We present T/Key, a time-based one-time password system that requires no secrets on the server. Our work modernizes the classic S/Key system and addresses the challenges in making such a system secure and practical. At the heart of our construction is a new lower bound analyzing the hardness of inverting hash chains composed of independent random functions, which formalizes the security of this widely used primitive. Additionally, we develop a near-optimal algorithm for quickly generating the required elements in a hash chain with little memory on the client. We report on our implementation of T/Key as an Android application. T/Key can be used as a replacement for current TOTP systems, and it remains secure in the event of a server-side compromise. The cost, as with S/Key, is that one-time passwords are longer than the standard six characters used in TOTP.",

        "title": "Mass Discovery of Android Traffic Imprints through Instantiated Partial Execution",
        "abstract": "Monitoring network behaviors of mobile applications, controlling their resource access and detecting potentially harmful apps are becoming increasingly important for the security protection within today's organizational, ISP and carriers. For this purpose, apps need to be identified from their communication, based upon their individual traffic signatures (called imprints in our research). Creating imprints for a large number of apps is nontrivial, due to the challenges in comprehensively analyzing their network activities at a large scale, for millions of apps on today's rapidly-growing app marketplaces. Prior research relies on automatic exploration of an app's user interfaces (UIs) to trigger its network activities, which is less likely to scale given the cost of the operation (at least 5 minutes per app) and its effectiveness (limited coverage of an app's behaviors). In this paper, we present Tiger (Traffic Imprint Generator), a novel technique that makes comprehensive app imprint generation possible in a massive scale. At the center of Tiger is a unique instantiated slicing technique, which aggressively prunes the program slice extracted from the app's network-related code by evaluating each variable's impact on possible network invariants, and removing those unlikely to contribute through assigning them concrete values. In this way, Tiger avoids exploring a large number of program paths unrelated to the app's identifiable traffic, thereby reducing the cost of the code analysis by more than one order of magnitude, in comparison with the conventional slicing and execution approach. Our experiments show that Tiger is capable of recovering an app's full network activities within 18 seconds, achieving over 98% coverage of its identifiable packets and 0.742% false detection rate on app identification. Further running the technique on over 200,000 real-world Android apps (including 78.23% potentially harmful apps) leads to the discovery of surprising new types of traffic invariants, including fake device information, hardcoded time values, session IDs and credentials, as well as complicated trigger conditions for an app's network activities, such as human involvement, Intent trigger and server-side instructions. Our findings demonstrate that many network activities cannot easily be invoked through automatic UI exploration and code-analysis based approaches present a promising alternative.",

        "abstract": "Using dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption, a user with limited storage resources can securely outsource a database to an untrusted server, in such a way that the database can still be searched and updated efficiently. For these schemes, it would be desirable that updates do not reveal any information a priori about the modifications they carry out, and that deleted results remain inaccessible to the server a posteriori. If the first property, called forward privacy, has been the main motivation of recent works, the second one, backward privacy, has been overlooked. In this paper, we study for the first time the notion of backward privacy for searchable encryption. After giving formal definitions for different flavors of backward privacy, we present several schemes achieving both forward and backward privacy, with various efficiency trade-offs. Our constructions crucially rely on primitives such as constrained pseudo-random functions and puncturable encryption schemes. Using these advanced cryptographic primitives allows for a fine-grained control of the power of the adversary, preventing her from evaluating functions on selected inputs, or decrypting specific ciphertexts. In turn, this high degree of control allows our SSE constructions to achieve the stronger forms of privacy outlined above. As an example, we present a framework to construct forward-private schemes from range-constrained pseudo-random functions. Finally, we provide experimental results for implementations of our schemes, and study their practical efficiency.",

        "abstract": "We continue the study of Homomorphic Secret Sharing (HSS), recently introduced by Boyle et al. (Crypto 2016, Eurocrypt 2017). A (2-party) HSS scheme splits an input x into shares (x0,x1) such that (1) each share computationally hides x, and (2) there exists an efficient homomorphic evaluation algorithm $\\Eval$ such that for any function (or \"program\") from a given class it holds that Eval(x0,P)+Eval(x1,P)=P(x). Boyle et al. show how to construct an HSS scheme for branching programs, with an inverse polynomial error, using discrete-log type assumptions such as DDH. We make two types of contributions. Optimizations. We introduce new optimizations that speed up the previous optimized implementation of Boyle et al. by more than a factor of 30, significantly reduce the share size, and reduce the rate of leakage induced by selective failure. Applications. Our optimizations are motivated by the observation that there are natural application scenarios in which HSS is useful even when applied to simple computations on short inputs. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of our HSS implementation in the context of such applications.",

        "abstract": "Towards advancing the use of big keys as a practical defense against key exfiltration, this paper provides efficiency improvements for cryptographic schemes in the bounded retrieval model (BRM). We identify probe complexity (the number of scheme accesses to the slow storage medium storing the big key) as the dominant cost. Our main technical contribution is what we call the large-alphabet subkey prediction lemma. It gives good bounds on the predictability under leakage of a random sequence of blocks of the big key, as a function of the block size. We use it to significantly reduce the probe complexity required to attain a given level of security. Together with other techniques, this yields security-preserving performance improvements for BRM symmetric encryption schemes and BRM public-key identification schemes.",

        "title": "The Waterfall of Liberty: Decoy Routing Circumvention that Resists Routing Attacks",
        "abstract": "Decoy routing is an emerging approach for censorship circumvention in which circumvention is implemented with help from a number of volunteer Internet autonomous systems, called decoy ASes. Recent studies on decoy routing consider all decoy routing systems to be susceptible to a fundamental attack -- regardless of their specific designs--in which the censors re-route traffic around decoy ASes, thereby preventing censored users from using such systems. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for decoy routing that, by design, is significantly stronger to rerouting attacks compared to all previous designs. Unlike previous designs, our new architecture operates decoy routers only on the downstream traffic of the censored users; therefore we call it downstream-only decoy routing. As we demonstrate through Internet-scale BGP simulations, downstream-only decoy routing offers significantly stronger resistance to rerouting attacks, which is intuitively because a (censoring) ISP has much less control on the downstream BGP routes of its traffic. Designing a downstream-only decoy routing system is a challenging engineering problem since decoy routers do not intercept the upstream traffic of censored users. We design the first downstream-only decoy routing system, called Waterfall, by devising unique covert communication mechanisms. We also use various techniques to make our Waterfall implementation resistant to traffic analysis attacks. We believe that downstream-only decoy routing is a significant step towards making decoy routing systems practical. This is because a downstream-only decoy routing system can be deployed using a significantly smaller number of volunteer ASes, given a target resistance to rerouting attacks. For instance, we show that a Waterfall implementation with only a single decoy AS is as resistant to routing attacks (against China) as a traditional decoy system (e.g., Telex) with 53 decoy ASes.",

        "title": "May the Fourth Be With You: A Microarchitectural Side Channel Attack on Several Real-World Applications of Curve25519",
        "abstract": "In recent years, applications increasingly adopt security primitives designed with better countermeasures against side channel attacks. A concrete example is Libgcrypt's implementation of ECDH encryption with Curve25519. The implementation employs the Montgomery ladder scalar-by-point multiplication, uses the unified, branchless Montgomery double-and-add formula and implements a constant-time argument swap within the ladder. However, Libgcrypt's field arithmetic operations are not implemented in a constant-time side-channel-resistant fashion. Based on the secure design of Curve25519, users of the curve are advised that there is no need to perform validation of input points. In this work we demonstrate that when this recommendation is followed, the mathematical structure of Curve25519 facilitates the exploitation of side-channel weaknesses. We demonstrate the effect of this vulnerability on three software applications---encrypted git, email and messaging---that use Libgcrypt. In each case, we show how to craft malicious OpenPGP files that use the Curve25519 point of order 4 as a chosen ciphertext to the ECDH encryption scheme. We find that the resulting interactions of the point at infinity, order-2, and order-4 elements in the Montgomery ladder scalar-by-point multiplication routine create side channel leakage that allows us to recover the private key in as few as 11 attempts to access such malicious files.",

        "abstract": "Domain squatting is a common adversarial practice where attackers register domain names that are purposefully similar to popular domains. In this work, we study a specific type of domain squatting called \"combosquatting,\" in which attackers register domains that combine a popular trademark with one or more phrases (e.g., betterfacebook[.]com, youtube-live[.]com). We perform the first large-scale, empirical study of combosquatting by analyzing more than 468 billion DNS records - collected from passive and active DNS data sources over almost six years. We find that almost 60% of abusive combosquatting domains live for more than 1,000 days, and even worse, we observe increased activity associated with combosquatting year over year. Moreover, we show that combosquatting is used to perform a spectrum of different types of abuse including phishing, social engineering, affiliate abuse, trademark abuse, and even advanced persistent threats. Our results suggest that combosquatting is a real problem that requires increased scrutiny by the security community.",

        "abstract": "Time and again, attribute-based encryption has been shown to be the natural cryptographic tool for building various types of conditional access systems with far-reaching applications, but the deployment of such systems has been very slow. A central issue is the lack of an encryption scheme that can operate on sensitive data very efficiently and, at the same time, provides features that are important in practice. This paper proposes the first fully secure ciphertext-policy and key-policy ABE schemes based on a standard assumption on Type-III pairing groups, which do not put any restriction on policy type or attributes. We implement our schemes along with several other prominent ones using the Charm library, and demonstrate that they perform better on almost all parameters of interest.",

        "abstract": "Kernel vulnerabilities are critical in security because they naturally allow attackers to gain unprivileged root access. Although there has been much research on finding kernel vulnerabilities from source code, there are relatively few research on kernel fuzzing, which is a practical bug finding technique that does not require any source code. Existing kernel fuzzing techniques involve feeding in random input values to kernel API functions. However, such a simple approach does not reveal latent bugs deep in the kernel code, because many API functions are dependent on each other, and they can quickly reject arbitrary parameter values based on their calling context. In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzing technique for commodity OS kernels that leverages inferred dependence model between API function calls to discover deep kernel bugs. We implement our technique on a fuzzing system, called IMF. IMF has already found 32 previously unknown kernel vulnerabilities on the latest macOS version 10.12.3 (16D32) at the time of this writing.",

        "abstract": "The functionality and security of all domain names are contingent upon their nameservers. When these nameservers, or requests to them, are compromised, all domains that rely on them are affected. In this paper, we study the exploitation of configuration issues (typosquatting and outdated WHOIS records) and hardware errors (bitsquatting) to seize control over nameservers' requests to hijack domains. We perform a large-scale analysis of 10,000 popular nameserver domains, in which we map out existing abuse and vulnerable entities. We confirm the capabilities of these attacks through real-world measurements. Overall, we find that over 12,000 domains are susceptible to near-immediate compromise, while 52.8M domains are being targeted by nameserver bitsquatters that respond with rogue IP addresses. Additionally, we determine that 1.28M domains are at risk of a denial-of-service attack by relying on an outdated nameserver.",

        "abstract": "Timing attacks have been a continuous threat to users' privacy in modern browsers. To mitigate such attacks, existing approaches, such as Tor Browser and Fermata, add jitters to the browser clock so that an attacker cannot accurately measure an event. However, such defenses only raise the bar for an attacker but do not fundamentally mitigate timing attacks, i.e., it just takes longer than previous to launch a timing attack. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called deterministic browser, which can provably prevent timing attacks in modern browsers. Borrowing from Physics, we introduce several concepts, such as an observer and a reference frame. Specifically, a snippet of JavaScript, i.e., an observer in JavaScript reference frame, will always obtain the same, fixed timing information so that timing attacks are prevented; at contrast, a user, i.e., an oracle observer, will perceive the JavaScript differently and do not experience the performance slowdown. We have implemented a prototype called DeterFox and our evaluation shows that the prototype can defend against browser-related timing attacks.",

        "title": "New Techniques for Structural Batch Verification in Bilinear Groups with Applications to Groth-Sahai Proofs",
        "abstract": "Bilinear groups form the algebraic setting for a multitude of important cryptographic protocols including anonymous credentials, e-cash, e-voting, e-coupon, and loyalty systems. It is typical of such crypto protocols that participating parties need to repeatedly verify that certain equations over bilinear groups are satisfied, e.g., to check that computed signatures are valid, commitments can be opened, or non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs verify correctly. Depending on the form and number of equations this part can quickly become a performance bottleneck due to the costly evaluation of the bilinear map. To ease this burden on the verifier, batch verification techniques have been proposed that allow to combine and check multiple equations probabilistically using less operations than checking each equation individually. In this work, we revisit the batch verification problem and existing standard techniques. We introduce a new technique which, in contrast to previous work, enables us to fully exploit the structure of certain systems of equations. Equations of the appropriate form naturally appear in many protocols, e.g., due to the use of Groth-Sahai proofs. The beauty of our technique is that the underlying idea is pretty simple: we observe that many systems of equations can alternatively be viewed as a single equation of products of polynomials for which probabilistic polynomial identity testing following Schwartz-Zippel can be applied. Comparisons show that our approach can lead to significant improvements in terms of the number of pairing evaluations. Indeed, for the BeleniosRF voting system presented at CCS 2016, we can reduce the number of pairings (required for ballot verification) from 4k+140, as originally reported by Chaidos et al., to k+7. As our implementation and benchmarks demonstrate, this may reduce the verification runtime to only 5% to 13% of the original runtime.",

        "abstract": "Functional encryption (FE) is an extremely powerful cryptographic mechanism that lets an authorized entity compute on encrypted data, and learn the results in the clear. However, all current cryptographic instantiations for general FE are too impractical to be implemented. We construct IRON, a provably secure, and practical FE system using Intel's recent Software Guard Extensions (SGX). We show that IRON can be applied to complex functionalities, and even for simple functions, outperforms the best known cryptographic schemes. We argue security by modeling FE in the context of hardware elements, and prove that IRON satisfies the security model.",

The research papers accepted addressed a wide variety of technical questions in the cyber domain and the maturity of the work spanned the range of initial ideas and proofs of concept to mature work that is ready for operational implementation. Papers were evaluated for the reproducibility of the work as represented by the documentation of methods and testing environments.",

        "abstract": "We present a new paradigm for multi-party private set intersection (PSI) that allows $n$ parties to compute the intersection of their datasets without revealing any additional information. We explore a variety of instantiations of this paradigm. Our protocols avoid computationally expensive public-key operations and are secure in the presence of any number of semi-honest participants (i.e., without an honest majority). We demonstrate the practicality of our protocols with an implementation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a multi-party PSI protocol. For 5 parties with data-sets of 220 items each, our protocol requires only 72 seconds. In an optimization achieving a slightly weaker variant of security (augmented semi-honest model), the same task requires only 22 seconds. The technical core of our protocol is oblivious evaluation of a programmable pseudorandom function (OPPRF), which we instantiate in three different ways. We believe our new OPPRF abstraction and constructions may be of independent interest.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of running a long-term on-demand service for executing actively-secure computations. We examined state-of-the-art tools and implementations for actively-secure computation and identified a set of key features indispensable to offer meaningful service like this. Since no satisfactory tools exist for the purpose, we developed Pool, a new tool for building and executing actively-secure computation protocols at extreme scales with nearly zero offline delay. With Pool, we are able to obliviously execute, for the first time, reactive computations like ORAM in the malicious threat model. Many technical benefits of Pool can be attributed to the concept of pool-based cut-and-choose. We show with experiments that this idea has significantly improved the scalability and usability of JIMU, a state-of-the-art LEGO protocol.",

        "abstract": "We implemented (a simplified version of) the branching-program obfuscator due to Gentry et al. (GGH15), which is itself a variation of the first obfuscation candidate by Garg et al. (GGHRSW13). To keep within the realm of feasibility, we had to give up on some aspects of the construction, specifically the \"multiplicative bundling\" factors that protect against mixed-input attacks. Hence our implementation can only support read-once branching programs. To be able to handle anything more than just toy problems, we developed a host of algorithmic and code-level optimizations. These include new variants of discrete Gaussian sampler and lattice trapdoor sampler, efficient matrix-manipulation routines, and many tradeoffs. We expect that these optimizations will find other uses in lattice-based cryptography beyond just obfuscation. Our implementation is the first obfuscation attempt using the GGH15 graded encoding scheme, offering performance advantages over other graded encoding methods when obfuscating finite-state machines with many states. In out most demanding setting, we were able to obfuscate programs with input length of 20 nibbles (80 bits) and over 100 states, which seems out of reach for prior implementations. Although further optimizations are surely possible, we do not expect any implementation of current schemes to be able to handle much larger parameters.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a cryptographic protocol for efficiently aggregating a count of unique items across a set of data parties privately - that is, without exposing any information other than the count. Our protocol allows for more secure and useful statistics gathering in privacy-preserving distributed systems such as anonymity networks; for example, it allows operators of anonymity networks such as Tor to securely answer the questions: how many unique users are using the distributed service? and how many hidden services are being accessed?. We formally prove the correctness and security of our protocol in the Universal Composability framework against an active adversary that compromises all but one of the aggregation parties. We also show that the protocol provides security against adaptive corruption of the data parties, which prevents them from being victims of targeted compromise. To ensure safe measurements, we also show how the output can satisfy differential privacy. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of the private set-union cardinality protocol (PSC) and use it to demonstrate that PSC operates with low computational overhead and reasonable bandwidth. In particular, for reasonable deployment sizes, the protocol run at timescales smaller than the typical measurement period would be and thus is suitable for distributed measurement.",

        "title": "POSTER: Watch Out Your Smart Watch When Paired",
        "abstract": "We coin a new term called \\textit{data transfusion} as a phenomenon that a user experiences when pairing a wearable device with the host device. A large amount of data stored in the host device (e.g., a smartphone) is forcibly copied to the wearable device (e.g., a smart watch) due to pairing while the wearable device is usually less attended. To the best of knowledge, there is no previous work that manipulates how sensitive data is transfused even without user's consent and how users perceive and behave regarding such a phenomenon for smart watches. We tackle this problem by conducting an experimental study of data extraction from commodity devices, such as in Android Wear, watchOS, and Tizen platforms, and a following survey study with 205 smart watch users, in two folds. The experimental studies have shown that a large amount of sensitive data was transfused, but there was not enough user notification. The survey results have shown that users have lower perception on smart watches for security and privacy than smartphones, but they tend to set the same passcode on both devices when needed. Based on the results, we perform risk assessment and discuss possible mitigation that involves volatile transfusion.",

        "title": "POSTER: Semi-supervised Classification for Dynamic Android Malware Detection",
        "abstract": "Manually labeling the large number of samples of Android APKs into benign or different malicious families requires tremendous human effort, while it is comparably easy and cheap to obtain a large amount of unlabeled APKs from various sources. Moreover, the fast-paced evolution of Android malware continuously generates derivative and new malware families. These families often contain new signatures, which can escape detection that uses static analysis. These practical challenges can also cause classical supervised machine learning algorithms to degrade in performance. We propose a framework that uses model-based semi-supervised (MBSS) classification scheme built using dynamic Android API call logs. The semi-supervised approach efficiently uses the labeled and unlabeled APKs to estimate a finite mixture model of Gaussian distributions via conditional expectation-maximization and efficiently detects malware during out-of-sample testing. We compare MBSS with the popular malware detection classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Under the ideal classification setting, MBSS has competitive performance with 98% accuracy and very low false positive rate for in-sample classification. For out-of-sample testing, the out-of-sample test data exhibit similar behavior of retrieving phone information and sending to the network, compared with in-sample training set. When this similarity is strong, MBSS and SVM with linear kernel maintain 90% detection rate while kNN and LDA suffer great performance degradation. When this similarity is slightly weaker, all classifiers degrade in performance, but MBSS still performs significantly better than other classifiers.",

        "abstract": "We propose a simple and efficient framework for obtaining efficient constant-round protocols for maliciously secure two-party computation. Our framework uses a function-independent preprocessing phase to generate authenticated information for the two parties; this information is then used to construct a single \"authenticated\" garbled circuit which is transmitted and evaluated. We also show how to efficiently instantiate the preprocessing phase with a new, highly optimized version of the TinyOT protocol by Nielsen et al. Our protocol outperforms existing work in both the single-execution and amortized settings, with or without preprocessing: In the single-execution setting, our protocol evaluates an AES circuit with malicious security in 37 ms with an online time of 1 ms. Previous work with the best overall time requires 62 ms (with 14 ms online time); previous work with the best online time (also 1 ms) requires 124 ms overall. If we amortize over 1024 executions, each AES computation requires just 6.7 ms with roughly the same online time as above. The best previous work in the amortized setting has roughly the same total time but does not support function-independent preprocessing. Our work shows that the performance penalty for maliciously secure two-party computation (as compared to semi-honest security) is much smaller than previously believed.",

However, while security researchers often utilize such techniques to address problems and AI/ML researchers develop techniques for Big Data analytics applications, neither community devotes much attention to the other. Within security research, AI/ML components are usually regarded as black-box solvers. Conversely, the learning community seldom considers the security/privacy implications entailed in the application of their algorithms when they are designing them. While these two communities generally focus on different directions, where these two fields do meet, interesting problems appear. Researchers working in this intersection have raised many novel questions for both communities and created a new branch of research known as secure learning. The AISec workshop has become the primary venue for this unique fusion of research.",

        "abstract": "Existing Greybox Fuzzers (GF) cannot be effectively directed, for instance, towards problematic changes or patches, towards critical system calls or dangerous locations, or towards functions in the stack-trace of a reported vulnerability that we wish to reproduce. In this paper, we introduce Directed Greybox Fuzzing (DGF) which generates inputs with the objective of reaching a given set of target program locations efficiently. We develop and evaluate a simulated annealing-based power schedule that gradually assigns more energy to seeds that are closer to the target locations while reducing energy for seeds that are further away. Experiments with our implementation AFLGo demonstrate that DGF outperforms both directed symbolic-execution-based whitebox fuzzing and undirected greybox fuzzing. We show applications of DGF to patch testing and crash reproduction, and discuss the integration of AFLGo into Google's continuous fuzzing platform OSS-Fuzz. Due to its directedness, AFLGo could find 39 bugs in several well-fuzzed, security-critical projects like LibXML2. 17 CVEs were assigned.",

        "abstract": "Trustworthy operation of industrial control systems depends on secure and real-time code execution on the embedded programmable logic controllers (PLCs). The controllers monitor and control the critical infrastructures, such as electric power grids and healthcare platforms, and continuously report back the system status to human operators. We present Zeus, a contactless embedded controller security monitor to ensure its execution control flow integrity. Zeus leverages the electromagnetic emission by the PLC circuitry during the execution of the controller programs. Zeus's contactless execution tracking enables non-intrusive monitoring of security-critical controllers with tight real-time constraints. Those devices often cannot tolerate the cost and performance overhead that comes with additional traditional hardware or software monitoring modules. Furthermore, Zeus provides an air-gap between the monitor (trusted computing base) and the target (potentially compromised) PLC. This eliminates the possibility of the monitor infection by the same attack vectors. Zeus monitors for control flow integrity of the PLC program execution. Zeus monitors the communications between the human machine interface and the PLC, and captures the control logic binary uploads to the PLC. Zeus exercises its feasible execution paths, and fingerprints their emissions using an external electromagnetic sensor. Zeus trains a neural network for legitimate PLC executions, and uses it at runtime to identify the control flow based on PLC's electromagnetic emissions. We implemented Zeus on a commercial Allen Bradley PLC, which is widely used in industry, and evaluated it on real-world control program executions. Zeus was able to distinguish between different legitimate and malicious executions with 98.9% accuracy and with zero overhead on PLC execution by design.",

        "title": "SlowFuzz: Automated Domain-Independent Detection of Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerabilities",
        "abstract": "Algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities occur when the worst-case time/space complexity of an application is significantly higher than the respective average case for particular user-controlled inputs. When such conditions are met, an attacker can launch Denial-of-Service attacks against a vulnerable application by providing inputs that trigger the worst-case behavior. Such attacks have been known to have serious effects on production systems, take down entire websites, or lead to bypasses of Web Application Firewalls. Unfortunately, existing detection mechanisms for algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities are domain-specific and often require significant manual effort. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate SlowFuzz, a domain-independent framework for automatically finding algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities. SlowFuzz automatically finds inputs that trigger worst-case algorithmic behavior in the tested binary. SlowFuzz uses resource-usage-guided evolutionary search techniques to automatically find inputs that maximize computational resource utilization for a given application. We demonstrate that SlowFuzz successfully generates inputs that match the theoretical worst-case performance for several well-known algorithms. SlowFuzz was also able to generate a large number of inputs that trigger different algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities in real-world applications, including various zip parsers used in antivirus software, regular expression libraries used in Web Application Firewalls, as well as hash table implementations used in Web applications. In particular, SlowFuzz generated inputs that achieve 300-times slowdown in the decompression routine of the bzip utility, discovered regular expressions that exhibit matching times exponential in the input size, and also managed to automatically produce inputs that trigger a high number of collisions in PHP's default hashtable implementation.",

        "abstract": "Existing probabilistic privacy enforcement approaches permit the execution of a program that processes sensitive data only if the information it leaks is within the bounds specified by a given policy. Thus, to extract any information, users must manually design a program that satisfies the policy. In this work, we present a novel synthesis approach that automatically transforms a program into one that complies with a given policy. Our approach consists of two ingredients. First, we phrase the problem of determining the amount of leaked information as Bayesian inference, which enables us to leverage existing probabilistic programming engines. Second, we present two synthesis procedures that add uncertainty to the program's outputs as a way of reducing the amount of leaked information: an optimal one based on SMT solving and a greedy one with quadratic running time. We implemented and evaluated our approach on 10 representative programs from multiple application domains. We show that our system can successfully synthesize a permissive enforcement mechanism for all examples.",

        "title": "Be Selfish and Avoid Dilemmas: Fork After Withholding (FAW) Attacks on Bitcoin",
        "abstract": "In the Bitcoin system, participants are rewarded for solving cryptographic puzzles. In order to receive more consistent rewards over time, some participants organize mining pools and split the rewards from the pool in proportion to each participant's contribution. However, several attacks threaten the ability to participate in pools. The block withholding (BWH) attack makes the pool reward system unfair by letting malicious participants receive unearned wages while only pretending to contribute work. When two pools launch BWH attacks against each other, they encounter the miner's dilemma: in a Nash equilibrium, the revenue of both pools is diminished. In another attack called selfish mining, an attacker can unfairly earn extra rewards by deliberately generating forks. In this paper, we propose a novel attack called a fork after withholding (FAW) attack. FAW is not just another attack. The reward for an FAW attacker is always equal to or greater than that for a BWH attacker, and it is usable up to four times more often per pool than in BWH attack. When considering multiple pools --- the current state of the Bitcoin network -- the extra reward for an FAW attack is about 56% more than that for a BWH attack. Furthermore, when two pools execute FAW attacks on each other, the miner's dilemma may not hold: under certain circumstances, the larger pool can consistently win. More importantly, an FAW attack, while using intentional forks, does not suffer from practicality issues, unlike selfish mining. We also discuss partial countermeasures against the FAW attack, but finding a cheap and efficient countermeasure remains an open problem. As a result, we expect to see FAW attacks among mining pools.",

        "abstract": "Write-Only Oblivious RAM (WoORAM) protocols provide privacy by encrypting the contents of data and also hiding the pattern of write operations over that data. WoORAMs provide better privacy than plain encryption and better performance than more general ORAM schemes (which hide both writing and reading access patterns), and the write-oblivious setting has been applied to important applications of cloud storage synchronization and encrypted hidden volumes. In this paper, we introduce an entirely new technique for Write-Only ORAM, called DetWoORAM. Unlike previous solutions, DetWoORAM uses a deterministic, sequential writing pattern without the need for any \"stashing\" of blocks in local state when writes fail. Our protocol, while conceptually simple, provides substantial improvement over prior solutions, both asymptotically and experimentally. In particular, under typical settings the DetWoORAM writes only 2 blocks (sequentially) to backend memory for each block written to the device, which is optimal. We have implemented our solution using the BUSE (block device in user-space) module and tested DetWoORAM against both an encryption only baseline of dm-crypt and prior, randomized WoORAM solutions, measuring only a 3x-14x slowdown compared to an encryption-only baseline and around 6x-19x speedup compared to prior work.",

        "title": "PtrSplit: Supporting General Pointers in Automatic Program Partitioning",
        "abstract": "Partitioning a security-sensitive application into least-privileged components and putting each into a separate protection domain have long been a goal of security practitioners and researchers. However, a stumbling block to automatically partitioning C/C++ applications is the presence of pointers in these applications. Pointers make calculating data dependence, a key step in program partitioning, difficult and hard to scale; furthermore, C/C++ pointers do not carry bounds information, making it impossible to automatically marshall and unmarshall pointer data when they are sent across the boundary of partitions. In this paper, we propose a set of techniques for supporting general pointers in automatic program partitioning. Our system, called PtrSplit, constructs a Program Dependence Graph (PDG) for tracking data and control dependencies in the input program and employs a parameter-tree approach for representing data of pointer types; this approach is modular and avoids global pointer analysis. Furthermore, it performs selective pointer bounds tracking to enable automatic marshalling/unmarshalling of pointer data, even when there is circularity and arbitrary aliasing. As a result, PtrSplit can automatically generate executable partitions for C applications that contain arbitrary pointers.",

        "title": "FirmUSB: Vetting USB Device Firmware using Domain Informed Symbolic Execution",
        "abstract": "The USB protocol has become ubiquitous, supporting devices from high-powered computing devices to small embedded devices and control systems. USB's greatest feature, its openness and expandability, is also its weakness, and attacks such as BadUSB exploit the unconstrained functionality afforded to these devices as a vector for compromise. Fundamentally, it is virtually impossible to know whether a USB device is benign or malicious. This work introduces FirmUSB, a USB-specific firmware analysis framework that uses domain knowledge of the USB protocol to examine firmware images and determine the activity that they can produce. Embedded USB devices use microcontrollers that have not been well studied by the binary analysis community, and our work demonstrates how lifters into popular intermediate representations for analysis can be built, as well as the challenges of doing so. We develop targeting algorithms and use domain knowledge to speed up these processes by a factor of 7 compared to unconstrained fully symbolic execution. We also successfully find malicious activity in embedded 8051 firmwares without the use of source code. Finally, we provide insights into the challenges of symbolic analysis on embedded architectures and provide guidance on improving tools to better handle this important class of devices.",

        "abstract": "The semiconductor industry is fully globalized and integrated circuits (ICs) are commonly defined, designed and fabricated in different premises across the world. This reduces production costs, but also exposes ICs to supply chain attacks, where insiders introduce malicious circuitry into the final products. Additionally, despite extensive post-fabrication testing, it is not uncommon for ICs with subtle fabrication errors to make it into production systems. While many systems may be able to tolerate a few byzantine components, this is not the case for cryptographic hardware, storing and computing on confidential data. For this reason, many error and backdoor detection techniques have been proposed over the years. So far all attempts have been either quickly circumvented, or come with unrealistically high manufacturing costs and complexity. This paper proposes Myst, a practical high-assurance architecture, that uses commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, and provides strong security guarantees, even in the presence of multiple malicious or faulty components. The key idea is to combine protective-redundancy with modern threshold cryptographic techniques to build a system tolerant to hardware trojans and errors. To evaluate our design, we build a Hardware Security Module that provides the highest level of assurance possible with COTS components. Specifically, we employ more than a hundred COTS secure cryptocoprocessors, verified to FIPS140-2 Level 4 tamper-resistance standards, and use them to realize high-confidentiality random number generation, key derivation, public key decryption and signing. Our experiments show a reasonable computational overhead (less than 1% for both Decryption and Signing) and an exponential increase in backdoor-tolerance as more ICs are added.",

        "title": "POSTER: Covert Channel Based on the Sequential Analysis in Android Systems",
        "abstract": "Due to the wide spread of android smartphones, different types of attacks have emerged against android systems and accordingly many researches have been accomplished in the android security. In particular, a variety of covert channels have been recently developed in android systems. They are usually built up by utilizing physical media and distinct characteristics of systems in the literature. To the best of our information, however, we do not find out any research work establishing covert channels in android systems on basis of the sequential analysis, which is a kind of statistical decision theory. This is mainly because the sequential analysis has been conventionally treated as defense technique in terms of security. In contrast to this common application of the sequential analysis, we discover a new covert channel based on the sequential analysis in android systems. The key idea of newly devised covert channel is to harness the sequential analysis in order to encode (resp. decode) private information bits to (resp. from) multiple sequences of randomly selected data. Through simulation, we demonstrate that our developed covert channel works efficiently and thus it could be substantial threat to android systems.",

        "title": "Web Tracking Technologies and Protection Mechanisms",
        "abstract": "Billions of users browse the Web on a daily basis, leaving their digital traces on millions of websites. Every such visit, every mouse move or button click may trigger a wide variety of hidden data exchanges across multiple tracking companies. As a result, these companies collect a vast amount of user's data, preferences and habits, that are extremely useful for online advertisers and profitable for data brokers, however very worrisome for the privacy of the users. In this \\emph{3-hours tutorial} we will cover the vide variety of Web tracking technologies, ranging from simple cookies to advanced cross-device fingerprinting. We will describe the main mechanisms behind web tracking and what users can do to protect themselves. Moreover, we will discuss solutions Web developers can use to automatically eliminate tracking from the third-party content they include in their applications. This tutorial will be of interest to a \\emph{general audience} of computer scientists, and \\emph{we do not require any specific prerequisite knowledge} for attendees. We will cover the following tracking mechanisms: \\begin{itemize} \\item third-party cookie tracking, and other stateful tracking techniques that enables tracking across multiple websites, \\item cookie respawning that is used to re-create deleted user cookies, \\item cookie synching that allows trackers and ad agencies to synchronise user IDs across different companies, \\item browser fingerprinting, including Canvas, WebRTC and AudioContext fingerprinting \\item cross-browser device fingerprinting, allowing trackers to recognise users across several devices. \\end{itemize} We will then demonstrate prevalence of such techniques on the Web, based on previous research. We will present the advertisement ecosystem and explain how Web technologies are used in advertisement, in particular in Real-Time-Bidding (RTB). We will explain how cookie synching is used in RTB and present recent analysis on how much a user's tracking data is worth. We will discuss the mechanisms the website owners use to automatically interact with the ad agencies, and explain its consequences on user's security and privacy. To help users protect themselves from Web tracking, we will give an overview of existing solutions. We'll start with the browser settings, and show that basic third-party cookie tracking is still possible even in the private browser mode of most common Web browsers. We then present privacy-protecting browser extensions and compare how efficient they are in protection from Web tracking. Then, we'll present possible protection mechanisms based on browser randomisation to protect from advanced fingerprinting techniques. Finally, we will present solutions for Web developers, who want to include third-party content in their websites, but would like to automatically remove any tracking of their users. In particular, we will discuss simple solutions that exist today for social plugins integration, and propose more advanced server-side based solutions that are a result of our own research.",

        "abstract": "Tor is a commonly used anonymous network that provides the hidden services. As the number of hidden services using Tor's anonymous network has been steadily increasing every year, so does the number of services that abuse Tor's anonymity. The existing research on the Tor is mainly focused on Tor's security loopholes and anonymity. As a result, how to collect and analyze the contents of Tor's hidden services is not yet in full swing. In addition, due to the slow access speed of the Tor browser, it is difficult to observe the dynamics of the hidden services. In this work, we present a tool that can monitor the status of hidden services for the analysis of authentic hidden service contents, and have automated our tool with the virtualization software, Docker, to improve the crawling performance. From August 12, 2017 to August 20, 2017, we collected a total of 9,176 sites and analyzed contents for 100 pages.",

        "abstract": "The recent unprecedented delegation of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) has exacerbated an existing, but fallow, problem called name collisions. One concrete exploit of such problem was discovered recently, which targets internal namespaces and enables Man in the Middle (MitM) attacks against end-user devices from anywhere on the Internet. Analysis of the underlying problem shows that it is not specific to any single service protocol, but little attention has been paid to understand the vulnerability status and the defense solution space at the service level. In this paper, we perform the first systematic study of the robustness of internal network services under name collision attacks. We first perform a measure study and uncover a wide spectrum of services affected by the name collision problem. We then collect their client implementations and systematically analyze their vulnerability status under name collision attacks using dynamic analysis. Out of the 48 identified exposed services, we find that nearly all (45) of them expose vulnerabilities in popular clients. To demonstrate the severity, we construct exploits and find a set of new name collision attacks with severe security implications including MitM attacks, internal or personal document leakage, malicious code injection, and credential theft. We analyze the causes, and find that the name collision problem broadly breaks common security assumptions made in today's service client software. Leveraging the insights from our analysis, we propose multiple service software level solutions, which enables the victim services to actively defend against name collision attacks.",

        "abstract": "Cache side channels are a type of attack vectors through which an adversary infers secret information of a running program by observing its use of CPU caches or other caching hardware. The study of cache side channels, particularly access-driven cache side channels, is gaining traction among security researchers in recent years. A large volume of papers on cache side-channel attacks or defenses is being published in both security and computer architecture conferences each year. However, due to the diversity of the research goals, methods, and perspectives, it becomes much harder for researchers new to this field to keep track of the frontiers of this research topic. As such, in this tutorial, we will provide a high-level overview of the studies of cache side channels to help other security researchers to comprehend the state of the art of this research area, and to identify research problems that have not been addressed by the community. We also hope to bridge the gaps between the security community and the computer architecture community on this specific research topic by summarizing research papers from both sides.",

        "title": "Most Websites Don't Need to Vibrate: A Cost-Benefit Approach to Improving Browser Security",
        "abstract": "Modern web browsers have accrued an incredibly broad set of features since being invented for hypermedia dissemination in 1990. Many of these features benefit users by enabling new types of web applications. However, some features also bring risk to users' privacy and security, whether through implementation error, unexpected composition, or unintended use. Currently there is no general methodology for weighing these costs and benefits. Restricting access to only the features which are necessary for delivering desired functionality on a given website would allow users to enforce the principle of lease privilege on use of the myriad APIs present in the modern web browser. However, security benefits gained by increasing restrictions must be balanced against the risk of breaking existing websites. This work addresses this problem with a methodology for weighing the costs and benefits of giving websites default access to each browser feature. We model the benefit as the number of websites that require the feature for some user-visible benefit, and the cost as the number of CVEs, lines of code, and academic attacks related to the functionality. We then apply this methodology to 74 Web API standards implemented in modern browsers. We find that allowing websites default access to large parts of the Web API poses significant security and privacy risks, with little corresponding benefit. We also introduce a configurable browser extension that allows users to selectively restrict access to low-benefit, high-risk features on a per site basis. We evaluated our extension with two hardened browser configurations, and found that blocking 15 of the 74 standards avoids 52.0% of code paths related to previous CVEs, and 50.0% of implementation code identified by our metric, without affecting the functionality of 94.7% of measured websites.",

        "title": "The TypTop System: Personalized Typo-Tolerant Password Checking",
        "abstract": "Password checking systems traditionally allow login only if the correct password is submitted. Recent work on typo-tolerant password checking suggests that usability can be improved, with negligible security loss, by allowing a small number of typographical errors. Existing systems, however, can only correct a handful of errors, such as accidentally leaving caps lock on or incorrect capitalization of the first letter in a password. This leaves out numerous kinds of typos made by users, such as transposition errors, substitutions, or capitalization errors elsewhere in a password. Some users therefore receive no benefit from existing typo-tolerance mechanisms. We introduce personalized typo-tolerant password checking. In our approach, the authentication system learns over time the typos made by a specific user. In experiments using Mechanical Turk, we show that 45% of users would benefit from personalization. Therefore, we design a system, called TypTop, that securely implements personalized typo-tolerance. Underlying TypTop is a new stateful password-based encryption scheme that can be used to store recent failed login attempts. Our formal analysis shows that security in the face of an attacker that obtains the state of the system reduces to the difficulty of a brute-force dictionary attack against the real password. We implement TypTop for Linux and Mac OS login and report on a proof-of-concept deployment.",

        "title": "Generating Synthetic Decentralized Social Graphs with Local Differential Privacy",
        "abstract": "A large amount of valuable information resides in decentralized social graphs, where no entity has access to the complete graph structure. Instead, each user maintains locally a limited view of the graph. For example, in a phone network, each user keeps a contact list locally in her phone, and does not have access to other users' contacts. The contact lists of all users form an implicit social graph that could be very useful to study the interaction patterns among different populations. However, due to privacy concerns, one could not simply collect the unfettered local views from users and reconstruct a decentralized social network. In this paper, we investigate techniques to ensure local differential privacy of individuals while collecting structural information and generating representative synthetic social graphs. We show that existing local differential privacy and synthetic graph generation techniques are insufficient for preserving important graph properties, due to excessive noise injection, inability to retain important graph structure, or both. Motivated by this, we propose LDPGen, a novel multi-phase technique that incrementally clusters users based on their connections to different partitions of the whole population. Every time a user reports information, LDPGen carefully injects noise to ensure local differential privacy.We derive optimal parameters in this process to cluster structurally-similar users together. Once a good clustering of users is obtained, LDPGen adapts existing social graph generation models to construct a synthetic social graph. We conduct comprehensive experiments over four real datasets to evaluate the quality of the obtained synthetic graphs, using a variety of metrics, including (i) important graph structural measures; (ii) quality of community discovery; and (iii) applicability in social recommendation. Our experiments show that the proposed technique produces high-quality synthetic graphs that well represent the original decentralized social graphs, and significantly outperform those from baseline approaches.",

        "title": "Evading Classifiers by Morphing in the Dark",
        "abstract": "Learning-based systems have been shown to be vulnerable to evasion through adversarial data manipulation. These attacks have been studied under assumptions that the adversary has certain knowledge of either the target model internals, its training dataset or at least classification scores it assigns to input samples. In this paper, we investigate a much more constrained and realistic attack scenario wherein the target classifier is minimally exposed to the adversary, revealing only its final classification decision (e.g., reject or accept an input sample). Moreover, the adversary can only manipulate malicious samples using a blackbox morpher. That is, the adversary has to evade the targeted classifier by morphing malicious samples \"in the dark\". We present a scoring mechanism that can assign a real-value score which reflects evasion progress to each sample based on the limited information available. Leveraging on such scoring mechanism, we propose an evasion method -- EvadeHC? and evaluate it against two PDF malware detectors, namely PDFRate and Hidost. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed evasion attacks are effective, attaining 100% evasion rate on the evaluation dataset. Interestingly, EvadeHC outperforms the known classifier evasion techniques that operate based on classification scores output by the classifiers. Although our evaluations are conducted on PDF malware classifiers, the proposed approaches are domain agnostic and are of wider application to other learning-based systems.",

        "title": "The Dynamics of Innocent Flesh on the Bone: Code Reuse Ten Years Later",
        "abstract": "In 2007, Shacham published a seminal paper on Return-Oriented Programming (ROP), the first systematic formulation of code reuse. The paper has been highly influential, profoundly shaping the way we still think about code reuse today: an attacker analyzes the \"geometry\" of victim binary code to locate gadgets and chains these to craft an exploit. This model has spurred much research, with a rapid progression of increasingly sophisticated code reuse attacks and defenses over time. After ten years, the common perception is that state-of-the-art code reuse defenses are effective in significantly raising the bar and making attacks exceedingly hard. In this paper, we challenge this perception and show that an attacker going beyond \"geometry\" (static analysis) and considering the \"dynamics\" (dynamic analysis) of a victim program can easily find function call gadgets even in the presence of state-of-the-art code-reuse defenses. To support our claims, we present Newton, a run-time gadget-discovery framework based on constraint-driven dynamic taint analysis. Newton can model a broad range of defenses by mapping their properties into simple, stackable, reusable constraints, and automatically generate gadgets that comply with these constraints. Using Newton, we systematically map and compare state-of-the-art defenses, demonstrating that even simple interactions with popular server programs are adequate for finding gadgets for all state-of-the-art code-reuse defenses. We conclude with an nginx case study, which shows that a Newton-enabled attacker can craft attacks which comply with the restrictions of advanced defenses, such as CPI and context-sensitive CFI.",

        "abstract": "HACL* is a verified portable C cryptographic library that implements modern cryptographic primitives such as the ChaCha20 and Salsa20 encryption algorithms, Poly1305 and HMAC message authentication, SHA-256 and SHA-512 hash functions, the Curve25519 elliptic curve, and Ed25519 signatures. HACL* is written in the F* programming language and then compiled to readable C code. The F* source code for each cryptographic primitive is verified for memory safety, mitigations against timing side-channels, and functional correctness with respect to a succinct high-level specification of the primitive derived from its published standard. The translation from F* to C preserves these properties and the generated C code can itself be compiled via the CompCert verified C compiler or mainstream compilers like GCC or CLANG. When compiled with GCC on 64-bit platforms, our primitives are as fast as the fastest pure C implementations in OpenSSL and libsodium, significantly faster than the reference C code in TweetNaCl, and between 1.1x-5.7x slower than the fastest hand-optimized vectorized assembly code in SUPERCOP. HACL* implements the NaCl cryptographic API and can be used as a drop-in replacement for NaCl libraries like libsodium and TweetNaCl. HACL* provides the cryptographic components for a new mandatory ciphersuite in TLS 1.3 and is being developed as the main cryptographic provider for the miTLS verified implementation. Primitives from HACL* are also being integrated within Mozilla's NSS cryptographic library. Our results show that writing fast, verified, and usable C cryptographic libraries is now practical.",

        "title": "Post-Quantum Zero-Knowledge and Signatures from Symmetric-Key Primitives",
        "abstract": "We propose a new class of post-quantum digital signature schemes that: (a) derive their security entirely from the security of symmetric-key primitives, believed to be quantum-secure, and (b) have extremely small keypairs, and, (c) are highly parameterizable. In our signature constructions, the public key is an image y=f(x) of a one-way function f and secret key x. A signature is a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of x, that incorporates a message to be signed. For this proof, we leverage recent progress of Giacomelli et al. (USENIX'16) in constructing an efficient \u03a3-protocol for statements over general circuits. We improve this \u03a3-protocol to reduce proof sizes by a factor of two, at no additional computational cost. While this is of independent interest as it yields more compact proofs for any circuit, it also decreases our signature sizes. We consider two possibilities to make the proof non-interactive: the Fiat-Shamir transform and Unruh's transform (EUROCRYPT'12, '15,'16). The former has smaller signatures, while the latter has a security analysis in the quantum-accessible random oracle model. By customizing Unruh's transform to our application, the overhead is reduced to 1.6x when compared to the Fiat-Shamir transform, which does not have a rigorous post-quantum security analysis. We implement and benchmark both approaches and explore the possible choice of f, taking advantage of the recent trend to strive for practical symmetric ciphers with a particularly low number of multiplications and end up using Low MC (EUROCRYPT'15).",

        "title": "POISED: Spotting Twitter Spam Off the Beaten Paths",
        "abstract": "Cybercriminals have found in online social networks a propitious medium to spread spam and malicious content. Existing techniques for detecting spam include predicting the trustworthiness of accounts and analyzing the content of these messages. However, advanced attackers can still successfully evade these defenses. Online social networks bring people who have personal connections or share common interests to form communities. In this paper, we first show that users within a networked community share some topics of interest. Moreover, content shared on these social network tend to propagate according to the interests of people. Dissemination paths may emerge where some communities post similar messages, based on the interests of those communities. Spam and other malicious content, on the other hand, follow different spreading patterns. In this paper, we follow this insight and present POISED, a system that leverages the differences in propagation between benign and malicious messages on social networks to identify spam and other unwanted content. We test our system on a dataset of 1.3M tweets collected from 64K users, and we show that our approach is effective in detecting malicious messages, reaching 91% precision and 93% recall. We also show that POISED's detection is more comprehensive than previous systems, by comparing it to three state-of-the-art spam detection systems that have been proposed by the research community in the past. POISED significantly outperforms each of these systems. Moreover, through simulations, we show how POISED is effective in the early detection of spam messages and how it is resilient against two well-known adversarial machine learning attacks.",

        "title": "No-Match Attacks and Robust Partnering Definitions: Defining Trivial Attacks for Security Protocols is Not Trivial",
        "abstract": "An essential cornerstone of the definition of security for key exchange protocols is the notion of partnering. The de-facto standard definition of partnering is that of (partial) matching conversations (MC), which essentially states that two processes are partnered if every message sent by the first is actually received by the second and vice versa. We show that proving security under MC-based definitions is error-prone. To this end, we introduce no-match attacks, a new class of attacks that renders many existing security proofs invalid. We show that no-match attacks are often hard to avoid in MC-based security definitions without a) modifications of the original protocol or b) resorting to the use of cryptographic primitives with special properties. Finally, we show several ways to thwart no-match attacks. Most notably and as one of our major contributions, we provide a conceptually new definition of partnering that circumvents the problems of a MC-based partnering notion while preserving all its advantages. Our new notion of partnering not only makes security definitions for key exchange model practice much more closely. In contrast to many other security notions of key exchange it also adheres to the high standards of good cryptographic definitions: it is general, supports cryptographic intuition, allows for efficient falsification, and provides a fundamental composition property that MC-based notions lack.",

        "title": "5Gen-C: Multi-input Functional Encryption and Program Obfuscation for Arithmetic Circuits",
        "abstract": "Program obfuscation is a powerful security primitive with many applications. White-box cryptography studies a particular subset of program obfuscation targeting keyed pseudorandom functions (PRFs), a core component of systems such as mobile payment and digital rights management. Although the white-box obfuscators currently used in practice do not come with security proofs and are thus routinely broken, recent years have seen an explosion of cryptographic techniques for obfuscation, with the goal of avoiding this build-and-break cycle. In this work, we explore in detail cryptographic program obfuscation and the related primitive of multi-input functional encryption (MIFE). In particular, we extend the 5Gen framework (CCS 2016) to support circuit-based MIFE and program obfuscation, implementing both existing and new constructions. We then evaluate and compare the efficiency of these constructions in the context of PRF obfuscation. As part of this work we (1) introduce a novel instantiation of MIFE that works directly on functions represented as arithmetic circuits, (2) use a known transformation from MIFE to obfuscation to give us an obfuscator that performs better than all prior constructions, and (3) develop a compiler for generating circuits optimized for our schemes. Finally, we provide detailed experiments, demonstrating, among other things, the ability to obfuscate a PRF with a 64-bit key and 12 bits of input (containing 62k gates) in under 4 hours, with evaluation taking around 1 hour. This is by far the most complex function obfuscated to date.",

        "title": "POSTER: Is Active Electromagnetic Side-channel Attack Practical?",
        "abstract": "Radio-frequency (RF) retroreflector attack (RFRA) is an {\\em active} electromagnetic side-channel attack that aims to leak the target's internal signals by irradiating the targeted device with a radio wave, where an attacker has embedded a malicious circuit (RF retroreflector) in the device in advance. As the retroreflector consists of small and cheap electrical elements such as a field-effect transistor (FET) chip and a wire that can work as a dipole antenna, the reflector can be embedded into various kinds of electric devices that carry unencrypted, sensitive information; e.g., keyboard, display monitor, microphone, speaker, USB, and so on. Only a few studies have addressed the basic mechanism of RFRA and demonstrated the success of the attack. The conditions for a successful attack have not been adequately explored before, and therefore, assessing the feasibility of the attack remains an open issue. In the present study, we aim to investigate empirically the conditions for a successful RFRA through field experiments. Understanding attack limitations should help to develop effective countermeasures against it. In particular, with regard to the conditions for a successful attack, we studied the distance between the attacker and the target, and the target signal frequencies. Through the extensive experiments using off-the-shelf hardware including software-defined radio (SDR) equipment, we revealed that the required conditions for a successful attack are (1) up to a 10-Mbps of target signal and (2) up to a distance of 10 meters. These results demonstrate the importance of the RFRA threat in the real world.",

        "abstract": "Much of recent research on mobile security has focused on malicious applications. Although mobile devices have powerful browsers that are commonly used by users and are vulnerable to at least as many attacks as their desktop counterparts, mobile web security has not received the attention that it deserves from the community. In particular, there is no longitudinal study that investigates the evolution of mobile browser vulnerabilities over the diverse set of browsers that are available out there. In this paper, we undertake the first such study, focusing on UI vulnerabilities among mobile browsers. We investigate and quantify vulnerabilities to 27 UI-related attacks---compiled from previous work and augmented with new variations of our own---across 128 browser families and 2,324 individual browser versions spanning a period of more than 5 years. In the process, we collect an extensive dataset of browser versions, old and new, from multiple sources. We also design and implement a browser-agnostic testing framework, called Hindsight, to automatically expose browsers to attacks and evaluate their vulnerabilities. We use Hindsight to conduct the tens of thousands of individual attacks that were needed for this study. We discover that 98.6% of the tested browsers are vulnerable to at least one of our attacks and that the average mobile web browser is becoming less secure with each passing year. Overall, our findings support the conclusion that mobile web security has been ignored by the community and must receive more attention.",

        "abstract": "Cybercrime markets support the development and diffusion of new attack technologies, vulnerability exploits, and malware. Whereas the revenue streams of cyber attackers have been studied multiple times in the literature, no quantitative account currently exists on the economics of attack acquisition and deployment. Yet, this understanding is critical to characterize the production of (traded) exploits, the economy that drives it, and its effects on the overall attack scenario. In this paper we provide an empirical investigation of the economics of vulnerability exploitation, and the effects of market factors on likelihood of exploit. Our data is collected first-handedly from a prominent Russian cybercrime market where the trading of the most active attack tools reported by the security industry happens. Our findings reveal that exploits in the underground are priced similarly or above vulnerabilities in legitimate bug-hunting programs, and that the refresh cycle of exploits is slower than currently often assumed. On the other hand, cybercriminals are becoming faster at introducing selected vulnerabilities, and the market is in clear expansion both in terms of players, traded exploits, and exploit pricing. We then evaluate the effects of these market variables on likelihood of attack realization, and find strong evidence of the correlation between market activity and exploit deployment. We discuss implications on vulnerability metrics, economics, and exploit measurement.",

        "abstract": "Notable recent security incidents have generated intense interest in adversaries which attempt to subvert---perhaps covertly---crypto\\-graphic algorithms. In this paper we develop (IND-CPA) Semantically Secure encryption in this challenging setting. This fundamental encryption primitive has been previously studied in the \"kleptographic setting,\" though existing results must relax the model by introducing trusted components or otherwise constraining the subversion power of the adversary: designing a Public Key System that is kletographically semantically secure (with minimal trust) has remained elusive to date. In this work, we finally achieve such systems, even when all relevant cryptographic algorithms are subject to adversarial (kleptographic) subversion. To this end we exploit novel inter-component randomized cryptographic checking techniques (with an offline checking component), combined with common and simple software engineering modular programming techniques (applied to the system's black box specification level). Moreover, our methodology yields a strong generic technique for the preservation of any semantically secure cryptosystem when incorporated into the strong kleptographic adversary setting.",

        "abstract": "In the last years we have witnessed the appearance of a variety of strategies to design optimal location privacy-preserving mechanisms, in terms of maximizing the adversary's expected error with respect to the users' whereabouts. In this work, we take a closer look at the defenses created by these strategies and show that, even though they are indeed optimal in terms of adversary's correctness, not all of them offer the same protection when looking at other dimensions of privacy. To avoid \"bad\" choices, we argue that the search for optimal mechanisms must be guided by complementary criteria. We provide two example auxiliary metrics that help in this regard: the conditional entropy, that captures an information-theoretic aspect of the problem; and the worst-case quality loss, that ensures that the output of the mechanism always provides a minimum utility to the users. We describe a new mechanism that maximizes the conditional entropy and is optimal in terms of average adversary error, and compare its performance with previously proposed optimal mechanisms using two real datasets. Our empirical results confirm that no mechanism fares well on every privacy criteria simultaneously, making apparent the need for considering multiple privacy dimensions to have a good understanding of the privacy protection a mechanism provides.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this work is to enable user authentication via finger inputs on ubiquitous surfaces leveraging low-cost physical vibration. We propose VibWrite that extends finger-input authentication beyond touch screens to any solid surface for smart access systems (e.g., access to apartments, vehicles or smart appliances). It integrates passcode, behavioral and physiological characteristics, and surface dependency together to provide a low-cost, tangible and enhanced security solution. VibWrite builds upon a touch sensing technique with vibration signals that can operate on surfaces constructed from a broad range of materials. It is significantly different from traditional password-based approaches, which only authenticate the password itself rather than the legitimate user, and the behavioral biometrics-based solutions, which usually involve specific or expensive hardware (e.g., touch screen or fingerprint reader), incurring privacy concerns and suffering from smudge attacks. VibWrite is based on new algorithms to discriminate fine-grained finger inputs and supports three independent passcode secrets including PIN number, lock pattern, and simple gestures by extracting unique features in the frequency domain to capture both behavioral and physiological characteristics such as contacting area, touching force, and etc. VibWrite is implemented using a single pair of low-cost vibration motor and receiver that can be easily attached to any surface (e.g., a door panel, a desk or an appliance). Our extensive experiments demonstrate that VibWrite can authenticate users with high accuracy (e.g., over 95% within two trials), low false positive rate (e.g., less 3%) and is robust to various types of attacks.",

        "title": "FlashGuard: Leveraging Intrinsic Flash Properties to Defend Against Encryption Ransomware",
        "abstract": "Encryption ransomware is a malicious software that stealthily encrypts user files and demands a ransom to provide access to these files. Several prior studies have developed systems to detect ransomware by monitoring the activities that typically occur during a ransomware attack. Unfortunately, by the time the ransomware is detected, some files already undergo encryption and the user is still required to pay a ransom to access those files. Furthermore, ransomware variants can obtain kernel privilege, which allows them to terminate software-based defense systems, such as anti-virus. While periodic backups have been explored as a means to mitigate ransomware, such backups incur storage overheads and are still vulnerable as ransomware can obtain kernel privilege to stop or destroy backups. Ideally, we would like to defend against ransomware without relying on software-based solutions and without incurring the storage overheads of backups. To that end, this paper proposes FlashGuard, a ransomware tolerant Solid State Drive (SSD) which has a firmware-level recovery system that allows quick and effective recovery from encryption ransomware without relying on explicit backups. FlashGuard leverages the observation that the existing SSD already performs out-of-place writes in order to mitigate the long erase latency of flash memories. Therefore, when a page is updated or deleted, the older copy of that page is anyway present in the SSD. FlashGuard slightly modifies the garbage collection mechanism of the SSD to retain the copies of the data encrypted by ransomware and ensure effective data recovery. Our experiments with 1,447 manually labeled ransomware samples show that FlashGuard can efficiently restore files encrypted by ransomware. In addition, we demonstrate that FlashGuard has a negligible impact on the performance and lifetime of the SSD.",

        "title": "SemFuzz: Semantics-based Automatic Generation of Proof-of-Concept Exploits",
        "abstract": "Patches and related information about software vulnerabilities are often made available to the public, aiming to facilitate timely fixes. Unfortunately, the slow paces of system updates (30 days on average) often present to the attackers enough time to recover hidden bugs for attacking the unpatched systems. Making things worse is the potential to automatically generate exploits on input-validation flaws through reverse-engineering patches, even though such vulnerabilities are relatively rare (e.g., 5% among all Linux kernel vulnerabilities in last few years). Less understood, however, are the implications of other bug-related information (e.g., bug descriptions in CVE), particularly whether utilization of such information can facilitate exploit generation, even on other vulnerability types that have never been automatically attacked. In this paper, we seek to use such information to generate proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits for the vulnerability types never automatically attacked. Unlike an input validation flaw that is often patched by adding missing sanitization checks, fixing other vulnerability types is more complicated, usually involving replacement of the whole chunk of code. Without understanding of the code changed, automatic exploit becomes less likely. To address this challenge, we present SemFuzz, a novel technique leveraging vulnerability-related text (e.g., CVE reports and Linux git logs) to guide automatic generation of PoC exploits. Such an end-to-end approach is made possible by natural-language processing (NLP) based information extraction and a semantics-based fuzzing process guided by such information. Running over 112 Linux kernel flaws reported in the past five years, SemFuzz successfully triggered 18 of them, and further discovered one zero-day and one undisclosed vulnerabilities. These flaws include use-after-free, memory corruption, information leak, etc., indicating that more complicated flaws can also be automatically attacked. This finding calls into question the way vulnerability-related information is shared today.",

        "abstract": "As the extension of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks to application layer in recent years, researchers pay much interest in these new variants due to a low-volume and intermittent pattern with a higher level of stealthiness, invaliding the state-of-the-art DDoS detection/defense mechanisms. We describe a new type of low-volume application layer DDoS attack--Tail Attacks on Web Applications. Such attack exploits a newly identified system vulnerability of n-tier web applications (millibottlenecks with sub-second duration and resource contention with strong dependencies among distributed nodes) with the goal of causing the long-tail latency problem of the target web application (e.g., 95th percentile response time > 1 second) and damaging the long-term business of the service provider, while all the system resources are far from saturation, making it difficult to trace the cause of performance degradation. We present a modified queueing network model to analyze the impact of our attacks in n-tier architecture systems, and numerically solve the optimal attack parameters. We adopt a feedback control-theoretic (e.g., Kalman filter) framework that allows attackers to fit the dynamics of background requests or system state by dynamically adjusting attack parameters. To evaluate the practicality of such attacks, we conduct extensive validation through not only analytical, numerical, and simulation results but also real cloud production setting experiments via a representative benchmark website equipped with state-of-the-art DDoS defense tools. We further proposed a solution to detect and defense the proposed attacks, involving three stages: fine-grained monitoring, identifying bursts, and blocking bots.",

        "abstract": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities are a severe class of web vulnerabilities that have received only marginal attention from the research and security testing communities. While much effort has been spent on countermeasures and detection of XSS and SQLi, to date, the detection of CSRF vulnerabilities is still performed predominantly manually. In this paper, we present Deemon, to the best of our knowledge the first automated security testing framework to discover CSRF vulnerabilities. Our approach is based on a new modeling paradigm which captures multiple aspects of web applications, including execution traces, data flows, and architecture tiers in a unified, comprehensive property graph. We present the paradigm and show how a concrete model can be built automatically using dynamic traces.Then, using graph traversals, we mine for potentially vulnerable operations. Using the information captured in the model, our approach then automatically creates and conducts security tests, to practically validate the found CSRF issues. We evaluate the effectiveness of Deemon with 10 popular open source web applications. Our experiments uncovered 14 previously unknown CSRF vulnerabilities that can be exploited, for instance, to take over user accounts or entire websites.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to formalizing and enforcing a class of use privacy properties in data-driven systems. In contrast to prior work, we focus on use restrictions on proxies (i.e. strong predictors) of protected information types. Our definition relates proxy use to intermediate computations that occur in a program, and identify two essential properties that characterize this behavior: 1) its result is strongly associated with the protected information type in question, and 2) it is likely to causally affect the final output of the program. For a specific instantiation of this definition, we present a program analysis technique that detects instances of proxy use in a model, and provides a witness that identifies which parts of the corresponding program exhibit the behavior. Recognizing that not all instances of proxy use of a protected information type are inappropriate, we make use of a normative judgment oracle that makes this inappropriateness determination for a given witness. Our repair algorithm uses the witness of an inappropriate proxy use to transform the model into one that provably does not exhibit proxy use, while avoiding changes that unduly affect classification accuracy. Using a corpus of social datasets, our evaluation shows that these algorithms are able to detect proxy use instances that would be difficult to find using existing techniques, and subsequently remove them while maintaining acceptable classification performance.",

        "abstract": "Domain names have been exploited for illicit online activities for decades. In the past, miscreants mostly registered new domains for their attacks. However, the domains registered for malicious purposes can be deterred by existing reputation and blacklisting systems. In response to the arms race, miscreants have recently adopted a new strategy, called domain shadowing, to build their attack infrastructures. Specifically, instead of registering new domains, miscreants are beginning to compromise legitimate ones and spawn malicious subdomains under them. This has rendered almost all existing countermeasures ineffective and fragile because subdomains inherit the trust of their apex domains, and attackers can virtually spawn an infinite number of shadowed domains. In this paper, we conduct the first study to understand and detect this emerging threat. Bootstrapped with a set of manually confirmed shadowed domains, we identify a set of novel features that uniquely characterize domain shadowing by analyzing the deviation from their apex domains and the correlation among different apex domains. Building upon these features, we train a classifier and apply it to detect shadowed domains on the daily feeds of VirusTotal, a large open security scanning service. Our study highlights domain shadowing as an increasingly rampant threat. Moreover, while previously confirmed domain shadowing campaigns are exclusively involved in exploit kits, we reveal that they are also widely exploited for phishing attacks. Finally, we observe that instead of algorithmically generating subdomain names, several domain shadowing cases exploit the wildcard DNS records.",

        "abstract": "We provide efficient constructions for trace-and-revoke systems with public traceability in the black-box confirmation model. Our constructions achieve adaptive security, are based on standard assumptions and achieve significant efficiency gains compared to previous constructions. Our constructions rely on a generic transformation from inner product functional encryption (IPFE) schemes to trace-and-revoke systems. Our transformation requires the underlying IPFE scheme to only satisfy a very weak notion of security -- the attacker may only request a bounded number of random keys -- in contrast to the standard notion of security where she may request an unbounded number of arbitrarily chosen keys. We exploit the much weaker security model to provide a new construction for bounded collusion and random key IPFE from the learning with errors assumption (LWE), which enjoys improved efficiency compared to the scheme of Agrawal et al. [CRYPTO'16]. Together with IPFE schemes from Agrawal et al., we obtain trace and revoke from LWE, Decision Diffie Hellman and Decision Composite Residuosity.",

        "abstract": "Many P2P applications are emerging that use Tor to ensure anonymity of their users. Each user in such an application creates an onion service so that the user can receive requests from other users. Such large-scale use of onion services leak a lot of sensitive information to guards in Tor. The cause of these leaks is diversity in guards' resources and the guard selection algorithm in Tor that is designed to use guards' resources efficiently. We describe a preliminary approach for selecting guards which reduces the amount of sensitive information leaked to guards while using guards' resources with same efficiency. Experiments in the context of a P2P publish/subscribe application shows that the approach reduces information leaked to guards by 25%.",

        "abstract": "The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine is the largest modern web archive, preserving web content since 1996. We discover and analyze several vulnerabilities in how the Wayback Machine archives data, and then leverage these vulnerabilities to create what are to our knowledge the first attacks against a user's view of the archived web. Our vulnerabilities are enabled by the unique interaction between the Wayback Machine's archives, other websites, and a user's browser, and attackers do not need to compromise the archives in order to compromise users' views of a stored page. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks through proof-of-concept implementations. Then, we conduct a measurement study to quantify the prevalence of vulnerabilities in the archive. Finally, we explore defenses which might be deployed by archives, website publishers, and the users of archives, and present the prototype of a defense for clients of the Wayback Machine, ArchiveWatcher.",

        "abstract": "The current evolution of the cyber-threat ecosystem shows that no system can be considered invulnerable. It is therefore important to quantify the risk level within a system and devise risk prediction methods such that proactive measures can be taken to reduce the damage of cyber attacks. We present RiskTeller, a system that analyzes binary file appearance logs of machines to predict which machines are at risk of infection months in advance. Risk prediction models are built by creating, for each machine, a comprehensive profile capturing its usage patterns, and then associating each profile to a risk level through both fully and semi-supervised learning methods. We evaluate RiskTeller on a year-long dataset containing information about all the binaries appearing on machines of 18 enterprises. We show that RiskTeller can use the machine profile computed for a given machine to predict subsequent infections with the highest prediction precision achieved to date.",

        "title": "STACCO: Differentially Analyzing Side-Channel Traces for Detecting SSL/TLS Vulnerabilities in Secure Enclaves",
        "abstract": "Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX) offers software applications a shielded execution environment, dubbed enclave, to protect their confidentiality and integrity from malicious operating systems. As processors with this extended feature become commercially available, many new software applications are developed to enrich to the SGX-enabled ecosystem. One important primitive for these applications is a secure communication channel between the enclave and a remote trusted party. The SSL/TLS protocol, which is the de facto standard for protecting transport-layer network communications, has been broadly regarded a natural choice for such purposes. However, in this paper, we show that the marriage between SGX and SSL may not be smooth sailing. Particularly, we consider a category of side-channel attacks against SSL/TLS implementations in secure enclaves, which we call the control-flow inference attacks. In these attacks, the malicious operating system kernel may perform a powerful man-in-the-kernel attack to collect execution traces of the enclave programs at the page level, the cacheline level, or the branch level, while positioning itself in the middle of the two communicating parties. At the center of our work is a differential analysis framework, dubbed Stacco, to dynamically analyze the SSL/TLS implementations and detect vulnerabilities-discernible execution traces-that can be exploited as decryption oracles. Surprisingly, in spite of the prevailing constant-time programming paradigm adopted by many cryptographic libraries, we found exploitable vulnerabilities in the latest versions of all the SSL/TLS libraries we have examined. To validate the detected vulnerabilities, we developed a man-in-the-kernel adversary to demonstrate Bleichenbacher attacks against the latest OpenSSL library running in the SGX enclave (with the help of Graphene) and completely broke the PreMasterSecret encrypted by a 4096-bit RSA public key with only 57286 queries. We also conducted CBC padding oracle attacks against the latest GnuTLS running in Graphene-SGX and an open-source SGX implementation of mbedTLS (i.e., mbedTLS-SGX) that runs directly inside the enclave, and showed that it only needs 48388 and 25717 queries, respectively, to break one block of AES ciphertext. Empirical evaluation suggests these man-in-the-kernel attacks can be completed within 1 or 2 hours. Our results reveal the insufficient understanding of side-channel security in SGX settings, and our study will provoke discussions on the secure implementation and adoption of SSL/TLS in secure enclaves.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies a privacy threat induced by the collection and monitoring of a user's touch gestures on touchscreen devices. The threat is a new form of persistent tracking which we refer to as \"touch-based tracking\". It goes beyond tracking of virtual identities and has the potential for cross-device tracking as well as identifying multiple users using the same device. To demonstrate the likelihood of touch-based tracking, we propose an information theoretic method that quantifies the amount of information revealed by individual features of gestures, samples of gestures as well as samples of gesture combinations, when modelled as feature vectors. We have also developed a purpose-built app, named \"TouchTrack\" that collects data from users and informs them on how unique they are when interacting with their touch devices. Our results from 89 different users indicate that writing samples and left swipes can reveal 73.7% and 68.6% of user information, respectively. Combining different combinations of gestures results in higher uniqueness, with the combination of keystrokes, swipes and writing revealing up to 98.5% of information about users. We correctly re-identify returning users with a success rate of more than 90%.",

        "title": "Why Do Developers Get Password Storage Wrong?: A Qualitative Usability Study",
        "abstract": "Passwords are still a mainstay of various security systems, as well as the cause of many usability issues. For end-users, many of these issues have been studied extensively, highlighting problems and informing design decisions for better policies and motivating research into alternatives. However, end-users are not the only ones who have usability problems with passwords! Developers who are tasked with writing the code by which passwords are stored must do so securely. Yet history has shown that this complex task often fails due to human error with catastrophic results. While an end-user who selects a bad password can have dire consequences, the consequences of a developer who forgets to hash and salt a password database can lead to far larger problems. In this paper we present a first qualitative usability study with 20 computer science students to discover how developers deal with password storage and to inform research into aiding developers in the creation of secure password systems.",

        "title": "Malicious-Secure Private Set Intersection via Dual Execution",
        "abstract": "Private set intersection (PSI) allows two parties, who each hold a set of items, to compute the intersection of those sets without revealing anything about other items. Recent advances in PSI have significantly improved its performance for the case of semi-honest security, making semi-honest PSI a practical alternative to insecure methods for computing intersections. However, the semi-honest security model is not always a good fit for real-world problems. In this work we introduce a new PSI protocol that is secure in the presence of malicious adversaries. Our protocol is based entirely on fast symmetric-key primitives and inherits important techniques from state-of-the-art protocols in the semi-honest setting. Our novel technique to strengthen the protocol for malicious adversaries is inspired by the dual execution technique of Mohassel & Franklin (PKC 2006). Our protocol is optimized for the random-oracle model, but can also be realized (with a performance penalty) in the standard model. We demonstrate our protocol's practicality with a prototype implementation. To securely compute the intersection of two sets of size 220 requires only 13 seconds with our protocol, which is ~12x faster than the previous best malicious-secure protocol (Rindal & Rosulek, Eurocrypt 2017), and only 3x slower than the best semi-honest protocol (Kolesnikov et al., CCS 2016).",

        "title": "Hearing Your Voice is Not Enough: An Articulatory Gesture Based Liveness Detection for Voice Authentication",
        "abstract": "Voice biometrics is drawing increasing attention as it is a promising alternative to legacy passwords for mobile authentication. Recently, a growing body of work shows that voice biometrics is vulnerable to spoofing through replay attacks, where an adversary tries to spoof voice authentication systems by using a pre-recorded voice sample collected from a genuine user. In this work, we propose VoiceGesture, a liveness detection system for replay attack detection on smartphones. It detects a live user by leveraging both the unique articulatory gesture of the user when speaking a passphrase and the mobile audio hardware advances. Specifically, our system re-uses the smartphone as a Doppler radar, which transmits a high frequency acoustic sound from the built-in speaker and listens to the reflections at the microphone when a user speaks a passphrase. The signal reflections due to user's articulatory gesture result in Doppler shifts, which are then analyzed for live user detection. VoiceGesture is practical as it requires neither cumbersome operations nor additional hardware but a speaker and a microphone that are commonly available on smartphones. Our experimental evaluation with 21 participants and different types of phones shows that it achieves over 99% detection accuracy at around 1% Equal Error Rate (EER). Results also show that it is robust to different phone placements and is able to work with different sampling frequencies.",

        "abstract": "Security protocol verification using commonly-used model-checkers or symbolic protocol verifiers has several intrinsic limitations. Spin suffers the state explosion problem; Proverif may report false attacks. An alternative approach is to use Coq. However, the effort required to verify protocols in Coq is high for two main reasons: correct protocol and property specification is a non-trivial task, and security proofs lack automation. This work claims that (1) using Coq for verification of cryptographic protocols can sometimes yield better results than Spin and Proverif, and (2) the verification process in Coq can be greatly alleviated if specification and proof engineering techniques are applied. Our approach is evaluated by verifying several representative case studies. Preliminary results are encouraging, we were able to verify two protocols that give imprecise results in Spin and Proverif, respectively. Further, we have automated proofs of secrecy and authentication for an important class of protocols.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a PU learning (Positive and Unlabeled learning) based system for potential URL attack detection. Previous machine learning based solutions for this task mainly formalize it as a supervised learning problem. However, in some scenarios, the data obtained always contains only a handful of known attack URLs, along with a large number of unlabeled instances, making the supervised learning paradigms infeasible. In this work, we formalize this setting as a PU learning problem, and solve it by combining two different strategies (two-stage strategy and cost-sensitive strategy). Experimental results show that the developed system can effectively find potential URL attacks. This system can either be deployed as an assistance for existing system or be employed to help cyber-security engineers to effectively discover potential attack mode so that they can improve the existing system with significantly less efforts.",

        "abstract": "Mature push button tools have emerged for checking trace properties (e.g. secrecy or authentication) of security protocols. The case of indistinguishability-based privacy properties (e.g. ballot privacy or anonymity) is more complex and constitutes an active research topic with several recent propositions of techniques and tools. We explore a novel approach based on type systems and provide a (sound) type system for proving equivalence of protocols, for a bounded or an unbounded number of sessions. The resulting prototype implementation has been tested on various protocols of the literature. It provides a significant speed-up (by orders of magnitude) compared to tools for a bounded number of sessions and complements in terms of expressiveness other state-of-the-art tools, such as ProVerif and Tamarin: e.g., we show that our analysis technique is the first one to handle a faithful encoding of the Helios e-voting protocol in the context of an untrusted ballot box.",

Besides mainstream research in hardware security, it also covers new, alternative or emerging application scenarios, such as the internet of things, nuclear weapons inspections, satellite security, or consumer and supply chain security. It also puts some focus on special purpose hardware and novel methodological solutions, such as particularly lightweight, small, low-cost, and energy-efficient devices, or even non-electronic security systems. Finally, ASHES welcomes any theoretical works that systematize and structure the area, and so-called \"Wild-and-Crazy\" papers that describe and distribute seminal ideas at an early conceptual stage to the community.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present the first longitudinal measurement study of the underground ecosystem fueling credential theft and assess the risk it poses to millions of users. Over the course of March, 2016--March, 2017, we identify 788,000 potential victims of off-the-shelf keyloggers; 12.4 million potential victims of phishing kits; and 1.9 billion usernames and passwords exposed via data breaches and traded on blackmarket forums. Using this dataset, we explore to what degree the stolen passwords---which originate from thousands of online services---enable an attacker to obtain a victim's valid email credentials---and thus complete control of their online identity due to transitive trust. Drawing upon Google as a case study, we find 7--25% of exposed passwords match a victim's Google account. For these accounts, we show how hardening authentication mechanisms to include additional risk signals such as a user's historical geolocations and device profiles helps to mitigate the risk of hijacking. Beyond these risk metrics, we delve into the global reach of the miscreants involved in credential theft and the blackhat tools they rely on. We observe a remarkable lack of external pressure on bad actors, with phishing kit playbooks and keylogger capabilities remaining largely unchanged since the mid-2000s.",

        "abstract": "Welcome to the 24th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security! \n \nSince 1993, CCS has been the ACM's flagship conference for research in all aspects of computing and communications security and privacy. This year's conference attracted a record number of 836 reviewed research paper submissions, of which a record number of 151 papers were selected for presentation at the conference and inclusion in the proceedings. \n \nThe papers were reviewed by a Program Committee of 146 leading researchers from academic, government, and industry from around the world. Reviewing was done in three rounds, with every paper being reviewed by two PC members in the first round, and additional reviews being assigned in later rounds depending on the initial reviews. Authors had an opportunity to respond to reviews received in the first two rounds. We used a subset of PC members, designated as the Discussion Committee, to help ensure that reviewers reconsidered their reviews in light of the author responses and to facilitate substantive discussions among the reviewers. Papers were discussed extensively on-line in the final weeks of the review process, and late reviews were requested from both PC members and external reviewers when additional expertise or perspective was needed to reach a decision. We are extremely grateful to the PC members for all their hard work in the review process, and to the external reviewers that contributed to selecting the papers for CCS. \n \nBefore starting the review process, of the 842 submissions the PC chairs removed six papers that clearly violated submission requirements or were duplicates, leaving 836 papers to review. In general, we were lenient on the requirements, only excluding papers that appeared to deliberately disregard the submission requirements. Instead of excluding papers which carelessly deanonymized the authors, or which abused appendices in the opinion of the chairs, we redacted (by modifying the submitted PDF) the offending content and allowed the papers to be reviewed, and offered to make redacted content in appendices available to reviewers upon request. \n \nOur review process involved three phases. In the first phase, each paper was assigned two reviewers. Following last year's practice, we adopted the Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS) for making most of the review assignments, which were then adjusted based on technical preferences declared by reviewers. Each reviewer had about 3 weeks to complete reviews for around 12 papers. Based on the results of these reviews, an additional reviewer was assigned to every paper that had at least one positive-leaning review. Papers where both initial reviews were negative, but with low confidence or significant positive aspects, were also assigned additional reviews. At the conclusion of the second reviewing round, authors had an opportunity to see the initial reviews and to submit a short rebuttal. To ensure that all the authors' responses were considered seriously by the reviewers, the Discussion Committee members worked closely with the reviewers to make sure that they considered and responded to the authors' rebuttals. When reviewers could not reach an agreement, or additional expertise was needed, we solicited additional reviews. The on-line discussion period was vibrant and substantive, and at the end of this process the 151 papers you find here were selected for CCS 2017.",

The analysis identifies the caches and the IP addresses used by the DNS platform, fingerprints the DNS software on the caches, and evaluates vulnerabilities allowing injection of spoofed records into the caches. DNS X-Ray is the first tool to perform an extensive analysis of the caching component on the DNS platforms. In addition, DNS X-Ray also provides statistics from previous invocations, enabling networks to check which for popular DNS software on the caches, the number of caches typically used on DNS platforms and more. We set up DNS X-Ray online, it can be accessed via a website http://www.dns.xray.sit.fraunhofer.de.",

        "abstract": "The use and prevalence of cloud and large-scale computing infrastructures is increasing. They are projected to be a dominant trend in computing for the foreseeable future: major cloud operators are now estimated to house millions of machines each and to host substantial (and growing) fractions of corporate and government IT and web infrastructure. CCSW is a forum for bringing together researchers and practitioners to discuss the challenges and implications of current and future trends to the security of cloud operators, tenants, and the larger Internet community. Of special interest are the security challenges from the integration of cloud infrastructures with IoT and mobile application deployments. CCSW welcomes submissions on new threats, countermeasures, and opportunities brought about by the move to cloud computing, with a preference for unconventional approaches, as well as measurement studies and case studies that shed light on the security implications of cloud infrastructure and use cases.",

        "abstract": "Cut-and-choose (CC) is the standard approach to making Yao's garbled circuit two-party computation (2PC) protocol secure against malicious adversaries. Traditional cut-and-choose operates at the level of entire circuits, whereas the LEGO paradigm (Nielsen & Orlandi, TCC 2009) achieves asymptotic improvements by performing cut-and-choose at the level of individual gates. In this work we propose a unified approach called DUPLO that spans the entire continuum between these two extremes. The cut-and-choose step in our protocol operates on the level of arbitrary circuit \"components,\" which can range in size from a single gate to the entire circuit itself. With this entire continuum of parameter values at our disposal, we find that the best way to scale 2PC to computations of realistic size is to use CC components of intermediate size, and not at the extremes. On computations requiring several millions of gates or more, our more general approach to CC gives between 4-7x improvement over existing approaches. In addition to our technical contributions of modifying and optimizing previous protocol techniques to work with general CC components, we also provide an extension of the recent Frigate circuit compiler (Mood et al, Euro S&P 2016) to effectively express any C-style program in terms of components which can be processed efficiently using our protocol.",

        "abstract": "The CyberW workshop is motivated by the significant gender imbalance in all security conferences, in terms of the number of publishing authors, PC members, organizers, and attendees. What causes this gender imbalance remains unclear. However, multiple research studies have shown that a diverse group is more creative, diligent, and productive than a homogeneous group. Achieving cyber security requires a diverse group. To maintain a sustainable and creative workforce, substantial efforts need to be made by the security community to broaden the participation from underrepresented groups in cyber security research conferences. We hope this workshop can attract all underrepresented cybersecurity professionals, students, and researchers to attend top security and privacy conferences, engage in cutting-edge security and privacy research, excel in cyber security professions, and ultimately take on leadership positions.",

        "abstract": "Third-party libraries are commonly used by app developers for alleviating the development efforts and for monetizing their apps. On Android, the host app and its third-party libraries reside in the same sandbox and share all privileges awarded to the host app by the user, putting the users' privacy at risk of intrusions by third-party libraries. In this paper, we introduce a new privilege separation approach for third-party libraries on stock Android. Our solution partitions Android applications at compile-time into isolated, privilege-separated compartments for the host app and the included third-party libraries. A particular benefit of our approach is that it leverages compiler-based instrumentation available on stock Android versions and thus abstains from modification of the SDK, the app bytecode, or the device firmware. A particular challenge for separating libraries from their host apps is the reconstruction of the communication channels and the preservation of visual fidelity between the now separated app and its libraries. We solve this challenge through new IPC-based protocols to synchronize layout and lifecycle management between different sandboxes. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our solution by applying it to real world apps from the Google Play Store that contain advertisements.",

        "abstract": "Individuals are continually observed by an ever-increasing number of sensors that make up the Internet of Things. The resulting streams of data, which are analyzed in real time, can reveal sensitive personal information about individuals. Hence, there is an urgent need for stream processing solutions that can analyze these data in real time with provable guarantees of privacy and low error. We present PeGaSus, a new algorithm for differentially private stream processing. Unlike prior work that has focused on answering individual queries over streams, our algorithm is the first that can simultaneously support a variety of stream processing tasks -- counts, sliding windows, event monitoring -- over multiple resolutions of the stream. PeGaSus uses a Perturber to release noisy counts, a data-adaptive Perturber to identify stable uniform regions in the stream, and a query specific Smoother, which combines the outputs of the Perturber and Grouper to answer queries with low error. In a comprehensive study using a WiFi access point dataset, we empirically show that PeGaSus can answer continuous queries with lower error than the previous state-of-the-art algorithms, even those specialized to particular query types.",

        "abstract": "Medical institutions must comply with various federal and state policies when they share sensitive medical data with others. Traditionally, such sharing is performed by sanitizing the identifying information from individual records. However, such sanitization removes the ability to later link the records belonging to the same patient across multiple institutions which is essential for medical cohort discovery. Currently, human honest brokers assume stewardship of non sanitized data and manually facilitate such cohort discovery. However, this is slow and prone to error, not to mention that any compromise of the honest broker breaks the system. In this work, we describe PriReMat, a toolset that we have developed for privacy preserving record linkage. The underlying protocol is based on strong security primitives that we had presented earlier. This work describes the distributed implementation over untrusted machines and networks.",

        "abstract": "With millions of apps available to users, the mobile app market is rapidly becoming very crowded. Given the intense competition, the time to market is a critical factor for the success and profitability of an app. In order to shorten the development cycle, developers often focus their efforts on the unique features and workflows of their apps and rely on third-party Open Source Software (OSS) for the common features. Unfortunately, despite their benefits, careless use of OSS can introduce significant legal and security risks, which if ignored can not only jeopardize security and privacy of end users, but can also cause app developers high financial loss. However, tracking OSS components, their versions, and interdependencies can be very tedious and error-prone, particularly if an OSS is imported with little to no knowledge of its provenance. We therefore propose OSSPolice, a scalable and fully-automated tool for mobile app developers to quickly analyze their apps and identify free software license violations as well as usage of known vulnerable versions of OSS. OSSPolice introduces a novel hierarchical indexing scheme to achieve both high scalability and accuracy, and is capable of efficiently comparing similarities of app binaries against a database of hundreds of thousands of OSS sources (billions of lines of code). We populated OSSPolice with 60K C/C++ and 77K Java OSS sources and analyzed 1.6M free Google Play Store apps. Our results show that 1) over 40K apps potentially violate GPL/AGPL licensing terms, and 2) over 100K of apps use known vulnerable versions of OSS. Further analysis shows that developers violate GPL/AGPL licensing terms due to lack of alternatives, and use vulnerable versions of OSS despite efforts from companies like Google to improve app security. OSSPolice is available on GitHub.",

        "title": "Side-Channel Attacks on BLISS Lattice-Based Signatures: Exploiting Branch Tracing against strongSwan and Electromagnetic Emanations in Microcontrollers",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the security of the BLISS lattice-based signature scheme, one of the most promising candidates for postquantum-secure signatures, against side-channel attacks. Several works have been devoted to its efficient implementation on various platforms, from desktop CPUs to microcontrollers and FPGAs, and more recent papers have also considered its security against certain types of physical attacks, notably fault injection and cache attacks. We turn to more traditional side-channel analysis, and describe several attacks that can yield a full key recovery. We first identify a serious source of leakage in the rejection sampling algorithm used during signature generation. Existing implementations of that rejection sampling step, which is essential for security, actually leak the \"relative norm\" of the secret key. We show how an extension of an algorithm due to Howgrave-Graham and Szydlo can be used to recover the key from that relative norm, at least when the absolute norm is easy to factor (which happens for a significant fraction of secret keys). We describe how this leakage can be exploited in practice both on an embedded device (an 8-bit AVR microcontroller) using electromagnetic analysis (EMA), and a desktop computer (recent Intel CPU running Linux) using branch tracing. The latter attack has been mounted against the open source VPN software strongSwan. We also show that other parts of the BLISS signing algorithm can leak secrets not just for a subset of secret keys, but for 100% of them. The BLISS Gaussian sampling algorithm in strongSwan is intrinsically variable time. This would be hard to exploit using a noisy source of leakage like EMA, but branch tracing allows to recover the entire randomness and hence the key: we show that a single execution of the strongSwan signature algorithm is actually sufficient for full key recovery. We also describe a more traditional side-channel attack on the sparse polynomial multiplications carried out in BLISS: classically, multiplications can be attacked using DPA; however, our target 8-bit AVR target implementation uses repeated shifted additions instead. Surprisingly, we manage to obtain a full key recovery in that setting using integer linear programming from a single EMA trace.",

        "abstract": "Voice assistants like Siri enable us to control IoT devices conveniently with voice commands, however, they also provide new attack opportunities for adversaries. Previous papers attack voice assistants with obfuscated voice commands by leveraging the gap between speech recognition system and human voice perception. The limitation is that these obfuscated commands are audible and thus conspicuous to device owners. In this poster, we propose a novel mechanism to directly attack the microphone used for sensing voice data with inaudible voice commands. We show that the adversary can exploit the microphone's non-linearity and play well-designed inaudible ultrasounds to cause the microphone to record normal voice commands, and thus control the victim device inconspicuously. We demonstrate via end-to-end real-world experiments that our inaudible voice commands can attack an Android phone and an Amazon Echo device with high success rates at a range of 2-3 meters.",

        "title": "Vulnerable Implicit Service: A Revisit",
        "abstract": "The services in Android applications can be invoked either explicitly or implicitly before Android 5.0. However, since the implicit service invocations suffer service hijacking attacks and thus lead to sensitive information leakage, they have been forbidden since Android 5.0. Thereafter since the Android system will simply throw an exception and crash the application that still invokes services implicitly, it was expected that application developers will be forced to convert the implicit service invocations to explicit ones by specifying the package name of the service to be called. In this paper, we revisit the service invocations by analyzing two sets of the same 1390 applications downloaded from Google Play Store before and after the the implicit service forbidden policy is enforced. We develop a static analysis framework called ISA to perform our study. Our analysis results show that the forbidden policy effectively reduces the number of vulnerable service invocations from 643 to 112, namely, 82.58% reduction. However, after a detailed analysis of the remaining 112 vulnerable invocations, we discover that the forbidden policy fails to resolve the service hijacking attacks. Among the 1390 applications downloaded in May 2017, we find 36 popular applications still vulnerable to service hijacking attacks, which can lead to the loss of user bank account and VPN login credentials, etc. Moreover, we find that the forbidden policy introduces a new type of denial of service attacks. Finally, we discuss the root challenges on resolving service hijacking attacks and propose countermeasures to help mitigate the service hijacking attacks.",

        "title": "Rise of the HaCRS: Augmenting Autonomous Cyber Reasoning Systems with Human Assistance",
        "abstract": "Software permeates every aspect of our world, from our homes to the infrastructure that provides mission-critical services. As the size and complexity of software systems increase, the number and sophistication of software security flaws increase as well. The analysis of these flaws began as a manual approach, but it soon became apparent that a manual approach alone cannot scale, and that tools were necessary to assist human experts in this task, resulting in a number of techniques and approaches that automated certain aspects of the vulnerability analysis process. Recently, DARPA carried out the Cyber Grand Challenge, a competition among autonomous vulnerability analysis systems designed to push the tool-assisted human-centered paradigm into the territory of complete automation, with the hope that, by removing the human factor, the analysis would be able to scale to new heights. However, when the autonomous systems were pitted against human experts it became clear that certain tasks, albeit simple, could not be carried out by an autonomous system, as they require an understanding of the logic of the application under analysis. Based on this observation, we propose a shift in the vulnerability analysis paradigm, from tool-assisted human-centered to human-assisted tool-centered. In this paradigm, the automated system orchestrates the vulnerability analysis process, and leverages humans (with different levels of expertise) to perform well-defined sub-tasks, whose results are integrated in the analysis. As a result, it is possible to scale the analysis to a larger number of programs, and, at the same time, optimize the use of expensive human resources. In this paper, we detail our design for a human-assisted automated vulnerability analysis system, describe its implementation atop an open-sourced autonomous vulnerability analysis system that participated in the Cyber Grand Challenge, and evaluate and discuss the significant improvements that non-expert human assistance can offer to automated analysis approaches.",

        "title": "SGX-BigMatrix: A Practical Encrypted Data Analytic Framework With Trusted Processors",
        "abstract": "Recently, using secure processors for trusted computing in cloud has attracted a lot of attention. Over the past few years, efficient and secure data analytic tools (e.g., map-reduce framework, machine learning models, and SQL querying) that can be executed over encrypted data using the trusted hardware have been developed. However, these prior efforts do not provide a simple, secure and high level language based framework that is suitable for enabling generic data analytics for non-security experts who do not have concepts such as \"oblivious execution\". In this paper, we thus provide such a framework that allows data scientists to perform the data analytic tasks with secure processors using a Python/Matlab-like high level language. Our framework automatically compiles programs written in our language to optimal execution code by managing issues such as optimal data block sizes for I/O, vectorized computations to simplify much of the data processing, and optimal ordering of operations for certain tasks. Furthermore, many language constructs such as if-statements are removed so that a non-expert user is less likely to create a piece of code that may reveal sensitive information while allowing oblivious data processing (i.e., hiding access patterns). Using these design choices, we provide guarantees for efficient and secure data analytics. We show that our framework can be used to run the existing big data benchmark queries over encrypted data using the Intel SGX efficiently. Our empirical results indicate that our proposed framework is orders of magnitude faster than the general oblivious execution alternatives.",

        "title": "RAIN: Refinable Attack Investigation with On-demand Inter-Process Information Flow Tracking",
        "abstract": "As modern attacks become more stealthy and persistent, detecting or preventing them at their early stages becomes virtually impossible. Instead, an attack investigation or provenance system aims to continuously monitor and log interesting system events with minimal overhead. Later, if the system observes any anomalous behavior, it analyzes the log to identify who initiated the attack and which resources were affected by the attack and then assess and recover from any damage incurred. However, because of a fundamental tradeoff between log granularity and system performance, existing systems typically record system-call events without detailed program-level activities (e.g., memory operation) required for accurately reconstructing attack causality or demand that every monitored program be instrumented to provide program-level information. To address this issue, we propose RAIN, a Refinable Attack INvestigation system based on a record-replay technology that records system-call events during runtime and performs instruction-level dynamic information flow tracking (DIFT) during on-demand process replay. Instead of replaying every process with DIFT, RAIN conducts system-call-level reachability analysis to filter out unrelated processes and to minimize the number of processes to be replayed, making inter-process DIFT feasible. Evaluation results show that RAIN effectively prunes out unrelated processes and determines attack causality with negligible false positive rates. In addition, the runtime overhead of RAIN is similar to existing system-call level provenance systems and its analysis overhead is much smaller than full-system DIFT.",

        "title": "CCCP: Closed Caption Crypto Phones to Resist MITM Attacks, Human Errors and Click-Through",
        "abstract": "Crypto Phones aim to establish end-to-end secure voice (and text) communications based on human-centric (usually) short checksum validation. They require end users to perform: (1) checksum comparison to detect traditional data-based man-in-the-middle (data MITM) attacks, and, optionally, (2) speaker verification to detect sophisticated voice-based man-in-the-middle (voice MITM) attacks. However, research shows that both tasks are prone to human errors making Crypto Phones highly vulnerable to MITM attacks, especially to data MITM given the prominence of these attacks. Further, human errors under benign settings undermine usability since legitimate calls would often need to be rejected. We introduce Closed Captioning Crypto Phones (CCCP), that remove the human user from the loop of checksum comparison by utilizing speech transcription. CCCP simply requires the user to announce the checksum to the other party--the system automatically transcribes the spoken checksum and performs the comparison. Automating checksum comparisons offers many key advantages over traditional designs: (1) the chances of data MITM due to human errors and \"click-through\" could be highly reduced (even eliminated); (2) longer checksums can be utilized, which increases the protocol security against data MITM; (3) users' cognitive burden is reduced due to the need to perform only a single task, thereby lowering the potential of human errors. As a main component of CCCP, we first design and implement an automated checksum comparison tool based on standard Speech to Text engines. To evaluate the security and usability benefits of CCCP, we then design and conduct an online user study that mimics a realistic VoIP scenario, and collect and transcribe a comprehensive data set spoken by a wide variety of speakers in real-life conditions. Our study results demonstrate that, by using our automated checksum comparison, CCCP can completely resist data MITM, while significantly reducing human errors in the benign case compared to the traditional approach. They also show that CCCP may help reduce the likelihood of voice MITM. Finally, we discuss how CCCP can be improved by designing specialized transcribers and carefully selected checksum dictionaries, and how it can be integrated with existing Crypto Phones to bolster their security and usability.",

        "abstract": "As organizations struggle with processing vast amounts of information, outsourcing sensitive data to third parties becomes a necessity. To protect the data, various cryptographic techniques are used in outsourced database systems to ensure data privacy, while allowing efficient querying. A rich collection of attacks on such systems has emerged. Even with strong cryptography, just communication volume or access pattern is enough for an adversary to succeed. In this work we present a model for differentially private outsourced database system and a concrete construction, \u03b5psolute, that provably conceals the aforementioned leakages, while remaining efficient and scalable. In our solution, differential privacy is preserved at the record level even against an untrusted server that controls data and queries. \u03b5psolute combines Oblivious RAM and differentially private sanitizers to create a generic and efficient construction. We go further and present a set of improvements to bring the solution to efficiency and practicality necessary for real-world adoption. We describe the way to parallelize the operations, minimize the amount of noise, and reduce the number of network requests, while preserving the privacy guarantees. We have run an extensive set of experiments, dozens of servers processing up to 10 million records, and compiled a detailed result analysis proving the efficiency and scalability of our solution. While providing strong security and privacy guarantees we are less than an order of magnitude slower than range query execution of a non-secure plain-text optimized RDBMS like MySQL and PostgreSQL.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel class of attacks against capacitive touchscreens, which are common in devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. The attack we named TOUCHFLOOD aims to scatter touch events, alternating the selection of buttons on a screen. The key idea of TOUCHFLOOD is to intentionally cause a malfunction by injecting intentional noise signals from an external source. This paper describes the attack as well as the experimental results that clarify the conditions for successful attacks. The demo videos of the experiments using a smartphone are available at https://goo.gl/56G79e.",

        "title": "On the Power of Optical Contactless Probing: Attacking Bitstream Encryption of FPGAs",
        "abstract": "Modern Integrated Circuits (ICs) employ several classes of countermeasures to mitigate physical attacks. Recently, a powerful semi-invasive attack relying on optical contactless probing has been introduced, which can assist the attacker in circumventing the integrated countermeasures and probe the secret data on a chip. This attack can be mounted using IC debug tools from the backside of the chip. The first published attack based on this technique was conducted against a proof-of-concept hardware implementation on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Therefore, the success of optical probing techniques against a real commercial device without any knowledge of the hardware implementation is still questionable. The aim of this work is to assess the threat of optical contactless probing in a real attack scenario. To this end, we conduct an optical probing attack against the bitstream encryption feature of a common FPGA. We demonstrate that the adversary is able to extract the plaintext data containing sensitive design information and intellectual property (IP). In contrast to previous optical attacks from the IC backside, our attack does not require any device preparation or silicon polishing, which makes it a non-invasive attack. Additionally, we debunk the myth that small technology sizes are unsusceptible to optical attacks, as we use an optical resolution of about 1 um to successfully attack a 28 nm device. Based on our time measurements, an attacker needs less than 10 working days to conduct the optical analysis and reverse-engineer the security-related parts of the hardware. Finally, we propose and discuss potential countermeasures, which could make the attack more challenging.",

        "title": "Fast Private Set Intersection from Homomorphic Encryption",
        "abstract": "Private Set Intersection (PSI) is a cryptographic technique that allows two parties to compute the intersection of their sets without revealing anything except the intersection. We use fully homomorphic encryption to construct a fast PSI protocol with a small communication overhead that works particularly well when one of the two sets is much smaller than the other, and is secure against semi-honest adversaries. The most computationally efficient PSI protocols have been constructed using tools such as hash functions and oblivious transfer, but a potential limitation with these approaches is the communication complexity, which scales linearly with the size of the larger set. This is of particular concern when performing PSI between a constrained device (cellphone) holding a small set, and a large service provider (e.g. WhatsApp), such as in the Private Contact Discovery application. Our protocol has communication complexity linear in the size of the smaller set, and logarithmic in the larger set. More precisely, if the set sizes are Ny < Nx, we achieve a communication overhead of O(Ny log Nx). Our running-time-optimized benchmarks show that it takes 36 seconds of online-computation, 71 seconds of non-interactive (receiver-independent) pre-processing, and only 12.5MB of round trip communication to intersect five thousand 32-bit strings with 16 million 32-bit strings. Compared to prior works, this is roughly a 38--115x reduction in communication with minimal difference in computational overhead.",

        "abstract": "This tutorial will present a systematic overview of {\\em kleptography}: stealing information subliminally from black-box cryptographic implementations; and {\\em cliptography}: defending mechanisms that clip the power of kleptographic attacks via specification re-designs (without altering the underlying algorithms). Despite the laudatory history of development of modern cryptography, applying cryptographic tools to reliably provide security and privacy in practice is notoriously difficult. One fundamental practical challenge, guaranteeing security and privacy without explicit trust in the algorithms and implementations that underlie basic security infrastructure, remains. While the dangers of entertaining adversarial implementation of cryptographic primitives seem obvious, the ramifications of such attacks are surprisingly dire: it turns out that -- in wide generality -- adversarial implementations of cryptographic (both deterministic and randomized) algorithms may leak private information while producing output that is statistically indistinguishable from that of a faithful implementation. Such attacks were formally studied in Kleptography. Snowden revelations has shown us how security and privacy can be lost at a very large scale even when traditional cryptography seems to be used to protect Internet communication, when Kleptography was not taken into consideration. We will first explain how the above-mentioned Kleptographic attacks can be carried out in various settings. We will then introduce several simple but rigorous immunizing strategies that were inspired by folklore practical wisdoms to protect different algorithms from implementation subversion. Those strategies can be applied to ensure security of most of the fundamental cryptographic primitives such as PRG, digital signatures, public key encryptions against kleptographic attacks when they are implemented accordingly. Our new design principles may suggest new standardization methods that help reducing the threats of subverted implementation. We also hope our tutorial to stimulate a community-wise efforts to further tackle the fundamental challenge mentioned at the beginning.",

        "abstract": "Device drivers are an essential part in modern Unix-like systems to handle operations on physical devices, from hard disks and printers to digital cameras and Bluetooth speakers. The surge of new hardware, particularly on mobile devices, introduces an explosive growth of device drivers in system kernels. Many such drivers are provided by third-party developers, which are susceptible to security vulnerabilities and lack proper vetting. Unfortunately, the complex input data structures for device drivers render traditional analysis tools, such as fuzz testing, less effective, and so far, research on kernel driver security is comparatively sparse. In this paper, we present DIFUZE, an interface-aware fuzzing tool to automatically generate valid inputs and trigger the execution of the kernel drivers. We leverage static analysis to compose correctly-structured input in the userspace to explore kernel drivers. DIFUZE is fully automatic, ranging from identifying driver handlers, to mapping to device file names, to constructing complex argument instances. We evaluate our approach on seven modern Android smartphones. The results show that DIFUZE can effectively identify kernel driver bugs, and reports 32 previously unknown vulnerabilities, including flaws that lead to arbitrary code execution.",

        "abstract": "The development of positioning technologies has resulted in an increasing amount of mobility data being available. While bringing a lot of convenience to people's life, such availability also raises serious concerns about privacy. In this paper, we concentrate on one of the most sensitive information that can be inferred from mobility data, namely social relationships. We propose a novel social relation inference attack that relies on an advanced feature learning technique to automatically summarize users' mobility features. Compared to existing approaches, our attack is able to predict any two individuals' social relation, and it does not require the adversary to have any prior knowledge on existing social relations. These advantages significantly increase the applicability of our attack and the scope of the privacy assessment. Extensive experiments conducted on a large dataset demonstrate that our inference attack is effective, and achieves between 13% to 20% improvement over the best state-of-the-art scheme. We propose three defense mechanisms -- hiding, replacement and generalization -- and evaluate their effectiveness for mitigating the social link privacy risks stemming from mobility data sharing. Our experimental results show that both hiding and replacement mechanisms outperform generalization. Moreover, hiding and replacement achieve a comparable trade-off between utility and privacy, the former preserving better utility and the latter providing better privacy.",

        "title": "Neural Network-based Graph Embedding for Cross-Platform Binary Code Similarity Detection",
        "abstract": "The problem of cross-platform binary code similarity detection aims at detecting whether two binary functions coming from different platforms are similar or not. It has many security applications, including plagiarism detection, malware detection, vulnerability search, etc. Existing approaches rely on approximate graph-matching algorithms, which are inevitably slow and sometimes inaccurate, and hard to adapt to a new task. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a novel neural network-based approach to compute the embedding, i.e., a numeric vector, based on the control flow graph of each binary function, then the similarity detection can be done efficiently by measuring the distance between the embeddings for two functions. We implement a prototype called Gemini. Our extensive evaluation shows that Gemini outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by large margins with respect to similarity detection accuracy. Further, Gemini can speed up prior art's embedding generation time by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude and reduce the required training time from more than 1 week down to 30 minutes to 10 hours. Our real world case studies demonstrate that Gemini can identify significantly more vulnerable firmware images than the state-of-the-art, i.e., Genius. Our research showcases a successful application of deep learning on computer security problems.",

        "abstract": "Bitcoin owes its success to the fact that transactions are transparently recorded in the blockchain, a global public ledger that removes the need for trusted parties. Unfortunately, recording every transaction in the blockchain causes privacy, latency, and scalability issues. Building on recent proposals for \"micropayment channels\" --- two party associations that use the ledger only for dispute resolution --- we introduce techniques for constructing anonymous payment channels. Our proposals allow for secure, instantaneous and private payments that substantially reduce the storage burden on the payment network. Specifically, we introduce three channel proposals, including a technique that allows payments via untrusted intermediaries. We build a concrete implementation of our scheme and show that it can be deployed via a soft fork to existing anonymous currencies such as ZCash.",

        "title": "Viden: Attacker Identification on In-Vehicle Networks",
        "abstract": "Various defense schemes --- which determine the presence of an attack on the in-vehicle network --- have recently been proposed. However, they fail to identify which Electronic Control Unit (ECU) actually mounted the attack. Clearly, pinpointing the attacker ECU is essential for fast/efficient forensic, isolation, security patch, etc. To meet this need, we propose a novel scheme, called Viden (Voltage-based attacker identification), which can identify the attacker ECU by measuring and utilizing voltages on the in-vehicle network. The first phase of Viden, called ACK learning, determines whether or not the measured voltage signals really originate from the genuine message transmitter. Viden then exploits the voltage measurements to construct and update the transmitter ECUs' voltage profiles as their fingerprints. It finally uses the voltage profiles to identify the attacker ECU. Since Viden adapts its profiles to changes inside/outside of the vehicle, it can pinpoint the attacker ECU under various conditions. Moreover, its efficiency and design-compliance with modern in-vehicle network implementations make Viden practical and easily deployable. Our extensive experimental evaluations on both a CAN bus prototype and two real vehicles have shown that Viden can accurately fingerprint ECUs based solely on voltage measurements and thus identify the attacker ECU with a low false identification rate of 0.2%.",

        "abstract": "Anomaly detection is a critical step towards building a secure and trustworthy system. The primary purpose of a system log is to record system states and significant events at various critical points to help debug system failures and perform root cause analysis. Such log data is universally available in nearly all computer systems. Log data is an important and valuable resource for understanding system status and performance issues; therefore, the various system logs are naturally excellent source of information for online monitoring and anomaly detection. We propose DeepLog, a deep neural network model utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to model a system log as a natural language sequence. This allows DeepLog to automatically learn log patterns from normal execution, and detect anomalies when log patterns deviate from the model trained from log data under normal execution. In addition, we demonstrate how to incrementally update the DeepLog model in an online fashion so that it can adapt to new log patterns over time. Furthermore, DeepLog constructs workflows from the underlying system log so that once an anomaly is detected, users can diagnose the detected anomaly and perform root cause analysis effectively. Extensive experimental evaluations over large log data have shown that DeepLog has outperformed other existing log-based anomaly detection methods based on traditional data mining methodologies.",

The question we ask is, what property X of h guarantees collision resistance (CR) of H? The classical answer is that X itself be CR. We show that weaker conditions X, in particular forms of what we call constrained-CR, suffice. This reduces demands on compression functions, to the benefit of security, and also, forensically, explains why collision-finding attacks on compression functions have not, historically, lead to immediate breaks of the corresponding hash functions. We obtain our results via a definitional framework called RS security, and a parameterized treatment of MD, that also serve to unify prior work and variants of the transform.",
