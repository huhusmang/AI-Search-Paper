        "title": "GAZEploit: Remote Keystroke Inference Attack by Gaze Estimation from Avatar Views in VR/MR Devices",
        "abstract": "The advent and growing popularity of Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR) solutions have revolutionized the way we interact with digital platforms. The cutting-edge gaze-controlled typing methods, now prevalent in high-end models of these devices, e.g., Apple Vision Pro, have not only improved user experience but also mitigated traditional keystroke inference attacks that relied on hand gestures, head movements and acoustic side-channels. However, this advancement has paradoxically given birth to a new, potentially more insidious cyber threat, GAZEploit. In this paper, we unveil GAZEploit, a novel eye-tracking based attack specifically designed to exploit these eye-tracking information by leveraging the common use of virtual appearances in VR applications. This widespread usage significantly enhances the practicality and feasibility of our attack compared to existing methods. GAZEploit takes advantage of this vulnerability to remotely extract gaze estimations and steal sensitive keystroke information across various typing scenarios-including messages, passwords, URLs, emails, and passcodes. Our research, involving 30 participants, achieved over 80% accuracy in keystroke inference. Alarmingly, our study also identified over 15 top-rated apps in the Apple Store as vulnerable to the GAZEploit attack, emphasizing the urgent need for bolstered security measures for this state-of-the-art VR/MR text entry method.",

        "abstract": "The standard definition of differential privacy (DP) ensures that a mechanism's output distribution on adjacent datasets is indistinguishable. However, real-world implementations of DP can, and often do, reveal information through their runtime distributions, making them susceptible to timing attacks. In this work, we establish a general framework for ensuring differential privacy in the presence of timing side channels. We define a new notion of timing privacy, which captures programs that remain differentially private to an adversary that observes the program's runtime in addition to the output. Our framework enables chaining together component programs that are timing-stable followed by a random delay to obtain DP programs that achieve timing privacy. Importantly, our definitions allow for measuring timing privacy and output privacy using different privacy measures. We illustrate how to instantiate our framework by giving programs for standard DP computations in the RAM and Word RAM models of computation. Furthermore, we show how our framework can be realized in code through a natural extension of the OpenDP Programming Framework.",

        "title": "Metric Differential Privacy at the User-Level via the Earth-Mover's Distance",
        "abstract": "Metric differential privacy (DP) provides heterogeneous privacy guarantees based on a distance between the pair of inputs. It is a widely popular notion of privacy since it captures the natural privacy semantics for many applications (such as, for location data) and results in better utility than standard DP. However, prior work in metric DP has primarily focused on the item-level setting where every user only reports a single data item. A more realistic setting is that of user-level DP where each user contributes multiple items and privacy is then desired at the granularity of the user's entire contribution. In this paper, we initiate the study of one natural definition of metric DP at the user-level. Specifically, we use the earth-mover's distance ($d_\\textsf{EM}$) as our metric to obtain a notion of privacy as it captures both the magnitude and spatial aspects of changes in a user's data. We make three main technical contributions. First, we design two novel mechanisms under $d_\\textsf{EM}$-DP to answer linear queries and item-wise queries. Specifically, our analysis for the latter involves a generalization of the privacy amplification by shuffling result which may be of independent interest. Second, we provide a black-box reduction from the general unbounded to bounded $d_\\textsf{EM}$-DP (size of the dataset is fixed and public) with a novel sampling based mechanism. Third, we show that our proposed mechanisms can provably provide improved utility over user-level DP, for certain types of linear queries and frequency estimation.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) empowered by deep neural networks (DNNs) are bringing transformative changes to our society. However, they are generally susceptible to adversarial attacks, especially physically realizable perturbations that can mislead perception and cause catastrophic outcomes. While existing defenses have shown success, there remains a pressing need for improved robustness while maintaining efficiency to meet real-time system operations. To tackle these challenges, we introduce PhySense, a complementary solution that leverages multi-faceted reasoning for misclassification detection and correction. This defense is built on physical characteristics, including static and dynamic object attributes and their interrelations. To effectively integrate these diverse sources, we develop a system based on the conditional random field that models objects and relationships as a spatial-temporal graph for holistic reasoning on the perceived scene. To ensure the defense does not violate the timing requirement of the real-time cyber-physical control loop, we profile the run-time characteristics of the workloads to parallelize and pipeline the execution of the defense implementation. The efficacy of PhySense is experimentally validated through simulations of datasets and real-world driving tests. It also demonstrates resiliency against adaptive attacks, and the potential of applying underlying principles to other modalities beyond vision.",

        "title": "PowerPeeler: A Precise and General Dynamic Deobfuscation Method for PowerShell Scripts",
        "abstract": "PowerShell is a powerful and versatile task automation tool. Unfortunately, it is also widely abused by cyber attackers. To bypass malware detection and hinder threat analysis, attackers often employ diverse techniques to obfuscate malicious PowerShell scripts. Existing deobfuscation tools suffer from the limitation of static analysis, which fails to simulate the real deobfuscation process accurately. In this paper, we propose PowerPeeler. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first dynamic PowerShell script deobfuscation approach at the instruction level. It utilizes expression-related Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) nodes to identify potential obfuscated script pieces. Then, PowerPeeler correlates the AST nodes with their corresponding instructions and monitors the script's entire execution process. Subsequently, PowerPeeler dynamically tracks the execution of these instructions and records their execution results. Finally, PowerPeeler stringifies these results to replace the corresponding obfuscated script pieces and reconstruct the deobfuscated script. To evaluate the effectiveness of PowerPeeler, we collect 1,736,669 real-world malicious PowerShell samples with diversity obfuscation methods. We compare PowerPeeler with five state-of-the-art deobfuscation tools and GPT-4. The evaluation results demonstrate that PowerPeeler can effectively handle all well-known obfuscation methods. Additionally, the deobfuscation correctness rate of PowerPeeler reaches 95%, significantly surpassing that of other tools. PowerPeeler not only recovers the highest amount of sensitive data but also maintains a semantic consistency over 97%, which is also the best. Moreover, PowerPeeler effectively obtains the largest quantity of valid deobfuscated results within a limited time frame. Furthermore, PowerPeeler is extendable and can be used as a helpful tool for other cyber security solutions.",

        "abstract": "The education technology (EdTech) landscape is expanding rapidly in higher education institutes (HEIs). This growth brings enormous complexity. Protecting the extensive data collected by these tools is crucial for HEIs as data breaches and misuses can have dire security and privacy consequences on the data subjects, particularly students, who are often compelled to use these tools. This urges an in-depth understanding of HEI and EdTech vendor dynamics, which is largely understudied. To address this gap, we conducted a semi-structured interview study with 13 participants who are in EdTech leadership roles at seven HEIs. Our study uncovers the EdTech acquisition process in the HEI context, the consideration of security and privacy issues throughout that process, the pain points of HEI personnel in establishing adequate protection mechanisms in service contracts, and their struggle in holding vendors accountable due to a lack of visibility into their system and power-asymmetry, among other reasons. We discuss certain observations about the status quo and conclude with recommendations for HEIs, researchers, and regulatory bodies to improve the situation.",

        "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have revolutionized 3D computer vision and graphics, facilitating novel view synthesis and influencing sectors like extended reality and e-commerce. However, NeRF's dependence on extensive data collection, including sensitive scene image data, introduces significant privacy risks when users upload this data for model training. To address this concern, we first propose SplitNeRF, a training framework that incorporates split learning (SL) techniques to enable privacy-preserving collaborative model training between clients and servers without sharing local data. Despite its benefits, we identify vulnerabilities in SplitNeRF by developing two attack methods, Surrogate Model Attack and Scene-aided Surrogate Model Attack, which exploit the shared gradient data and a few leaked scene images to reconstruct private scene information. To counter these threats, we introduce $S^2$NeRF, secure SplitNeRF that integrates effective defense mechanisms. By introducing decaying noise related to the gradient norm into the shared gradient information, $S^2$NeRF preserves privacy while maintaining a high utility of the NeRF model. Our extensive evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of $S^2$NeRF against privacy breaches, confirming its viability for secure NeRF training in sensitive applications.",

        "abstract": "Popular Chinese Input Method Editor (IME) keyboards almost universally feature \u201ccloud-based\u201d features that improve character prediction when typing. Handling such sensitive data (i.e., keystrokes) in transit demands security in transit. In this work, we perform a comprehensive security measurement of the Chinese IME keyboard ecosystem, investigating the network security of keystrokes sent in transit by popular Chinese IME keyboards from nine vendors. We studied the three most popular third-party keyboards, comprising 95.9% of the third-party keyboard market share in China, as well as the default Chinese IME keyboards pre-installed on six popular Android mobile device manufacturers in China. We found that the vast majority of IME keyboards utilize proprietary, non-TLS network encryption protocols. Our measurement revealed critical vulnerabilities in these encryption protocols from eight out of the nine vendors in which network attackers could completely reveal the contents of users\u2019 keystrokes in transit. We estimate that up to one billion users were affected by these vulnerabilities. Finally, we provide recommendations to various stakeholders to limit the harm from this existing set of vulnerabilities, as well as to prevent future vulnerabilities of this kind.",

PG is flexible and extensible, supporting a variety of fusion algorithms and application scenarios. On the theoretical side, PG develops and unifies techniques from dependable distributed systems and modern cryptography. PG can provably protect the privacy of individual sensor inputs and fusion results. In contrast to prior works, PG can provably defend against pollution attacks and guarantee output delivery, even in the presence of malicious sensors that may lie about their inputs, contribute ill-formed inputs, and provide no inputs at all to sway the final result, and in the presence of malicious servers serving as aggregators. On the practical side, we implement PG in the client-server-sensor setting. Moreover, we deploy PG in a cloud-based system",

        "title": "Phantom: Untargeted Poisoning Attacks on Semi-Supervised Learning (Full Version)",
        "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can handle increasingly complex tasks, albeit they require rapidly expanding training datasets. Collecting data from platforms with user-generated content, such as social networks, has significantly eased the acquisition of large datasets for training DNNs. Despite these advancements, the manual labeling process remains a substantial challenge in terms of both time and cost. In response, Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) approaches have emerged, where only a small fraction of the dataset needs to be labeled, leaving the majority unlabeled. However, leveraging data from untrusted sources like social networks also creates new security risks, as potential attackers can easily inject manipulated samples. Previous research on the security of SSL primarily focused on injecting backdoors into trained models, while less attention was given to the more challenging untargeted poisoning attacks. In this paper, we introduce Phantom, the first untargeted poisoning attack in SSL that disrupts the training process by injecting a small number of manipulated images into the unlabeled dataset. Unlike existing attacks, our approach only requires adding few manipulated samples, such as posting images on social networks, without the need to control the victim. Phantom causes SSL algorithms to overlook the actual images' pixels and to rely only on maliciously crafted patterns that \\ourname superimposed on the real images. We show Phantom's effectiveness for 6 different datasets and 3 real-world social-media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest). Already small fractions of manipulated samples (e.g., 5\\%) reduce the accuracy of the resulting model by 10\\%, with higher percentages leading to a performance comparable to a naive classifier. Our findings demonstrate the threat of poisoning user-generated content platforms, rendering them unsuitable for SSL in specific tasks.",

        "title": "Whipping the Multivariate-based MAYO Signature Scheme using Hardware Platforms",
        "abstract": "NIST issued a new call in 2023 to diversify the portfolio of quantum-resistant digital signature schemes since the current portfolio relies on lattice problems. The MAYO scheme, which builds on the Un-balanced Oil and Vinegar (UOV) problem, is a promising candidate for this new call. MAYO introduces emulsifier maps and a novel \u2018whipping\u2019 technique to significantly reduce the key sizes compared to previous UOV schemes. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the implementation aspects of MAYO and proposes several optimization techniques that we use to implement a high-speed hardware accelerator. The first optimization technique is the partial unrolling of the emulsification process to increase parallelization. The second proposed optimization is a novel memory structure enabling the parallelization of significant bottlenecks in the MAYO scheme. In addition to this, we present a flexible transposing technique for the data format used in MAYO that can be expanded to other UOV-based schemes. We use these techniques to design the first high-speed ASIC and FPGA accelerator that supports all operations of the MAYO scheme for different NIST security levels. Compared with state-of-the-art, like HaMAYO [23] and UOV [7], our FPGA design shows a performance benefit of up to three orders of magnitude in both latency and area-time-product. Furthermore, we lower the BRAM consumption by up to 2 . 8 \u00d7 compared to these FPGA implementations. Compared to high-end CPU implementations, our ASIC design allows between 2 . 81 \u00d7 and 60 . 14 \u00d7 higher throughputs. This increases the number of signing operations per second from 483 to 13424, thereby fostering performant deployment of the MAYO scheme in time-critical applications.",

        "abstract": "This work presents Unbundle-Rewrite-Rebundle (URR), a system for detecting privacy-harming portions of bundled JavaScript code and rewriting that code at runtime to remove the privacy-harming behavior without breaking the surrounding code or overall application. URR is a novel solution to the problem of JavaScript bundles, where websites pre-compile multiple code units into a single file, making it impossible for content filters and ad-blockers to differentiate between desired and unwanted resources. Where traditional content filtering tools rely on URLs, URR analyzes the code at the AST level, and replaces harmful AST sub-trees with privacy-and-functionality maintaining alternatives. We present an open-sourced implementation of URR as a Firefox extension and evaluate it against JavaScript bundles generated by the most popular bundling system (Webpack) deployed on the Tranco 10k. We evaluate URR by precision (1.00), recall (0.95), and speed (0.43s per script) when detecting and rewriting three representative privacy-harming libraries often included in JavaScript bundles, and find URR to be an effective approach to a large-and-growing blind spot unaddressed by current privacy tools.",

        "abstract": "The security landscape of software systems has witnessed considerable advancements through dynamic testing methodologies, especially fuzzing. Traditionally, fuzzing involves a sequential, cyclic process where software is tested to identify crashes. These crashes are then triaged and patched, leading to subsequent cycles that uncover further vulnerabilities. While effective, this method is not efficient as each cycle potentially reveals new issues previously obscured by earlier crashes, thus resulting in vulnerabilities being discovered sequentially. In this paper, we present a solution to identify occluded future vulnerabilities \u2014 vulnerabilities that are hard or impossible to trigger due to current vulnerabilities occluding the triggering path. We introduce robust fuzzing, a novel technique that enables fuzzers probe beyond the immediate crash location and uncover new vulnerabilities or variants of known ones. We implemented robust fuzzing in FlakJack, a pioneering fuzzing add-on that leverages binary patching to proactively identify occluded future vulnerabilities hidden behind current crashes. By enabling fuzzers to bypass immediate crash points and delve deeper into the software, FlakJack not only accelerates the vulnerability discovery process but also significantly enhances the efficacy of software testing.

        "abstract": "Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) are a critical building block for hybrid encryption and modern security protocols, notably in the post-quantum setting. Given the asymmetric public key of a recipient, the primitive establishes a shared secret key between sender and recipient. In recent years, a large number of abstract designs and concrete implementations of KEMs have been proposed, e.g., in the context of the NIST process for post-quantum primitives. In this work, we (i) establish stronger security notions for KEMs, and (ii) develop a symbolic analysis method to analyze security protocols that use KEMs. First, we generalize existing security notions for KEMs in the computational setting, introduce several stronger security notions and prove their relations. Our new properties formalize in which sense outputs of the KEM uniquely determine, i.e., bind , other values. Our new binding properties can be used, e.g., to prove the absence of attacks that were not captured by prior security notions, such as re-encapsulation attacks. Second, we develop a family of fine-grained symbolic models that correspond to our hierarchy of computational security notions, and are suitable for the automated analysis of KEM-based security protocols. We encode our models as a library in the framework of the Tamarin prover. Given a KEM-based protocol, our approach can automatically derive the minimal binding properties required from the KEM; or, if also given a concrete KEM, can analyze if the protocol meets its security goals. In case studies, Tamarin automatically discovers, e.g., that the key exchange protocol proposed in the original Kyber paper [12] requires stronger properties from the KEM than were proven in [12].",

        "title": "Fisher Information guided Purification against Backdoor Attacks",
        "abstract": "Studies on backdoor attacks in recent years suggest that an adversary can compromise the integrity of a deep neural network (DNN) by manipulating a small set of training samples. Our analysis shows that such manipulation can make the backdoor model converge to a bad local minima, i.e., sharper minima as compared to a benign model. Intuitively, the backdoor can be purified by re-optimizing the model to smoother minima. However, a na\\\"ive adoption of any optimization targeting smoother minima can lead to sub-optimal purification techniques hampering the clean test accuracy. Hence, to effectively obtain such re-optimization, inspired by our novel perspective establishing the connection between backdoor removal and loss smoothness, we propose Fisher Information guided Purification (FIP), a novel backdoor purification framework. Proposed FIP consists of a couple of novel regularizers that aid the model in suppressing the backdoor effects and retaining the acquired knowledge of clean data distribution throughout the backdoor removal procedure through exploiting the knowledge of Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). In addition, we introduce an efficient variant of FIP, dubbed as Fast FIP, which reduces the number of tunable parameters significantly and obtains an impressive runtime gain of almost $5\\times$. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on a wide range of backdoor defense benchmarks: 5 different tasks -- Image Recognition, Object Detection, Video Action Recognition, 3D point Cloud, Language Generation; 11 different datasets including ImageNet, PASCAL VOC, UCF101; diverse model architectures spanning both CNN and vision transformer; 14 different backdoor attacks, e.g., Dynamic, WaNet, LIRA, ISSBA, etc.",

        "title": "Eclipse: Preventing Speculative Memory-error Abuse with Artificial Data Dependencies",
        "abstract": "Historically, researchers have treated memory safety-based and speculative execution attacks as two separate domains. Recent work has introduced Speculative Memory-error Abuse (SMA) attacks, which combine memory corruption vulnerabilities with Spectre-like primitives. Using SMA, an attacker can leak sensitive program information and defeat a wide variety of memory-corruption miti-gations, including (K)ASLR, software-based XOM, and even ARM PA, eventually carrying out an end-to-end (architecturally-visible) exploit. We present Eclipse : a novel protection scheme against SMA attacks. Eclipse works by propagating artificial data dependencies onto sensitive data, preventing the CPU from using attacker-controlled data during speculative execution. We demonstrate that Eclipse provides comprehensive protection against speculative-probing and PACMAN-style attacks, two prominent examples of SMA attacks that target both the x86(-64) and ARM architectures. We evaluate the performance of Eclipse on x86-64 and demonstrate that it introduces minimal overhead, compared to alternative hardening approaches, incurring \u2248 0%\u20139 . 5% slowdown on SPEC CPU 2017, up to 8 . 6% slowdown in real-world applications, and negligible overhead in the Linux kernel.",

        "title": "PeTAL: Ensuring Access Control Integrity against Data-only Attacks on Linux",
        "abstract": "Data-only attacks are emerging as a new threat to the security of modern operating systems. As a typical data-only attack, memory corruption attacks can compromise the integrity of kernel data, which effectively breaks the premises of access control systems. Unfortunately, the prevalence of memory corruption vulnerabilities allows attackers to exploit them and bypass access control mechanisms. Given the arbitrary memory access capability, attackers can overwrite access control policies or illegally access the kernel resources protected by the access control systems. This paper presents PeTAL, a practical access control integrity solution against data-only attacks on the ARM-based Linux kernel. PeTAL is designed to ensure access control integrity by providing policy integrity and complete enforcement of access control systems. PeTAL first identifies kernel data used as access control policies and kernel data protected by access control policies, based on the user interfaces of the Linux kernel. Then, PeTAL leverages the ARM Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) and Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) to comprehensively protect the integrity of the identified kernel data and pointers. We implemented the prototype of PeTAL and evaluated the performance and the security impact of PeTAL on real AArch64 hardware with PAC and MTE support. Our evaluation results show that PeTAL can effectively thwart memory-corruption-based attacks on access control systems with reasonable performance overheads at most 4% on average in user applications, demonstrating its efficient prospects for kernel security.",

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNN) are increasingly deployed in heterogeneous hardware, including high-performance devices like GPUs and low-power devices like mobile/IoT CPUs, FPGAs, and accelerators. In order to unlock the full performance potential of various hardware, deep learning (DL) compilers automatically optimize DNN inference computations and compile DNN models into DNN executables for efficient computations across hardware backends. As valuable intellectual properties, DNN architectures are one primary attack target. Since previous works already demonstrate the abuse of cache side channels to steal DNN architectures from DL frameworks (e.g., PyTorch and TensorFlow), we first study using those known side-channel attacks against DNN executables. We find that attacking DNN executables presents unique challenges, and existing works can hardly apply. Particularly, DNN executa-bles exhibit a standalone paradigm that largely reduces cache side channel attack surfaces. Meanwhile, cache side channels capture only limited behaviors of the whole DNN execution while facing daunting technical challenges (e.g., noise and low time resolution). However, we unveil a unique attack vector in DNN executables, such that the cache-aware optimizations, which are extensively employed by contemporary DL compilers to harvest the full potentials of hardware, would result in distinguishable DNN operator cache access patterns, making model architecture recovery possible. We propose DeepCache, an end-to-end side channel attack framework, to infer DNN model architectures from DNN executables. Deep-Cache leverages cache side channels as the attacking primitives and combines contrastive learning and anomaly detection to enable precise inference.

        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables clients to train a joint model without disclosing their local data. Instead, they share their local model updates with a central server that moderates the process and creates a joint model. However, FL is susceptible to a series of privacy attacks. Recently, the source inference attack (SIA) has been proposed where an honest-but-curious central server tries to identify exactly which client owns a specific data record. n this work, we propose a defense against SIAs by using a trusted shuffler, without compromising the accuracy of the joint model. We employ a combination of unary encoding with shuffling, which can effectively blend all clients' model updates, preventing the central server from inferring information about each client's model update separately. In order to address the increased communication cost of unary encoding we employ quantization. Our preliminary experiments show promising results; the proposed mechanism notably decreases the accuracy of SIAs without compromising the accuracy of the joint model.",

        "abstract": "We present an approach to lift position-independent x86-64 binaries to symbolized NASM. Symbolization is a decompilation step that enables binary patching: functions can be modified, and instructions can be interspersed. Moreover, it is the first abstraction step in a larger decompilation chain. The produced NASM is recom-pilable, and we extensively test the recompiled binaries to see if they exhibit the same behavior as the original ones. In addition to testing, the produced NASM is accompanied with a certificate, constructed in such a way that if all theorems in the certificate hold, symbolization has occurred correctly. The original and recom-piled binary are lifted again with a third-party decompiler (Ghidra). These representations, as well as the certificate, are loaded into the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover, where proof scripts ensure that correctness can be proven automatically. We have applied sym-bolization to various stripped binaries from various sources, from various compilers, and ranging over various optimization levels. We show how symbolization enables binary-level patching, by tackling challenges originating from industry.",

        "title": "TREC: APT Tactic / Technique Recognition via Few-Shot Provenance Subgraph Learning",
        "abstract": "APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) with the characteristics of persistence, stealth, and diversity is one of the greatest threats against cyber-infrastructure. As a countermeasure, existing studies leverage provenance graphs to capture the complex relations between system entities in a host for effective APT detection. In addition to detecting single attack events as most existing work does, understanding the tactics / techniques (e.g., Kill-Chain, ATT&CK) applied to organize and accomplish the APT attack campaign is more important for security operations. Existing studies try to manually design a set of rules to map low-level system events to high-level APT tactics / techniques. However, the rule based methods are coarse-grained and lack generalization ability, thus they can only recognize APT tactics and cannot identify fine-grained APT techniques and mutant APT attacks. In this paper, we propose TREC, the first attempt to recognize APT tactics / techniques from provenance graphs by exploiting deep learning techniques. To address the\"needle in a haystack\"problem, TREC segments small and compact subgraphs covering individual APT technique instances from a large provenance graph based on a malicious node detection model and a subgraph sampling algorithm. To address the\"training sample scarcity\"problem, TREC trains the APT tactic / technique recognition model in a few-shot learning manner by adopting a Siamese neural network. We evaluate TREC based on a customized dataset collected and made public by our team. The experiment results show that TREC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems in APT tactic recognition and TREC can also effectively identify APT techniques.",

        "abstract": "Home wireless mesh networks (WMNs) are increasingly gaining popularity for their superior extensibility and signal coverage compared to traditional single-AP wireless networks. In particular, there is a single gateway node and multiple extender nodes that cooperate to provide wireless coverage. We observe that there is no comprehensive research conducted on the security aspects of the control plane of such networks. For example, this decentralized architecture enables each extender node to independently authenticate wireless clients by synchronizing access control policies from the gateway node. However, this synchronization unexpectedly opens an attack surface which has not been scrutinized. In our research, we conduct an empirical study investigating devices and protocols of six popular home wireless mesh network vendors, focusing on the attack surface introduced by the access policy synchronization. Interestingly, we find that the exact protocols used to support such functionalities vary by vendors, despite the existence of the EasyMesh standard that vendors could opt-in. Furthermore, we find a number of serious security flaws, including but not limited to malicious clients retaining their network access indefinitely and direct compromises of gateway and extender nodes in some cases. These issues arise due to the lack of coordination across different layers of protocols that work together to support the control plane. We reported all of our findings to the affected vendors and they have acknowledged the issues and are working towards fixes (most of the vendors have released patches). Finally, we discuss trade-offs in different existing designs, suggest alternative solutions, and summarize lessons learned from the research.",

        "title": "zkLLM: Zero Knowledge Proofs for Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "The recent surge in artificial intelligence (AI), characterized by the prominence of large language models (LLMs), has ushered in fundamental transformations across the globe. However, alongside these advancements, concerns surrounding the legitimacy of LLMs have grown, posing legal challenges to their extensive applications. Compounding these concerns, the parameters of LLMs are often treated as intellectual property, restricting direct investigations. In this study, we address a fundamental challenge within the realm of AI legislation: the need to establish the authenticity of outputs generated by LLMs. To tackle this issue, we present zkLLM, which stands as the inaugural specialized zero-knowledge proof tailored for LLMs to the best of our knowledge. Addressing the persistent challenge of non-arithmetic operations in deep learning, we introduce tlookup, a parallelized lookup argument designed for non-arithmetic tensor operations in deep learning, offering a solution with no asymptotic overhead. Furthermore, leveraging the foundation of tlookup, we introduce zkAttn, a specialized zero-knowledge proof crafted for the attention mechanism, carefully balancing considerations of running time, memory usage, and accuracy. Empowered by our fully parallelized CUDA implementation, zkLLM emerges as a significant stride towards achieving efficient zero-knowledge verifiable computations over LLMs. Remarkably, for LLMs boasting 13 billion parameters, our approach enables the generation of a correctness proof for the entire inference process in under 15 minutes. The resulting proof, compactly sized at less than 200 kB, is designed to uphold the privacy of the model parameters, ensuring no inadvertent information leakage.",

        "title": "Precio: Private Aggregate Measurement via Oblivious Shuffling",
        "abstract": "We introduce Precio, a new secure aggregation method for computing layered histograms and sums over secret shared data in a client-server setting. Precio is motivated by ad conversion measurement scenarios, where online advertisers and ad networks want to measure the performance of ad campaigns without requiring privacy-invasive techniques, such as third-party cookies. Precio has linear (communication) complexity in the number of data points and guarantees differentially private outputs. We formally analyze its security and privacy and present a thorough performance evaluation. The protocol supports much larger domains than Prio. It supports much more flexible aggregates than the DPF-based solution and in some settings has up to four orders of magnitude better performance",

        "title": "CountDown: Refcount-guided Fuzzing for Exposing Temporal Memory Errors in Linux Kernel",
        "abstract": "Kernel use-after-free (UAF) bugs are severe threats to system security due to their complex root causes and high exploitability. We find that 36.1% of recent kernel UAF bugs are caused by improper uses of reference counters, dubbed refcount-related UAF bugs. Current kernel fuzzing tools based on code coverage can detect common memory errors, but none of them is aware of the root cause. As a consequence, they only trigger refcount-related UAF bugs passively and coincidentally, and may miss many deep hidden vulnerabilities. To actively trigger refcount-related UAF bugs, in this paper, we propose CountDown, a novel refcount-guided kernel fuzzer. CountDown collects diverse refcount operations from kernel executions and reshapes syscall relations based on commonly accessed refcounts. When generating user-space programs, CountDown prefers to combine syscalls that ever access the same refcounts, aiming to trigger complex refcount behaviors. It also injects refcount-decreasing and refcount-accessing syscalls to intentionally free the refcounted object and trigger invalid accesses through dangling pointers. We test CountDown on mainstream Linux kernels and compare it with popular fuzzers. On average, our tool can detect 66.1% more UAF bugs and 32.9% more KASAN reports than state-of-the-art tools. CountDown has found nine new kernel memory bugs, where two are fixed and one is confirmed.",

        "abstract": "Fully Encrypted Protocols (FEPs) have arisen in practice as a technique to avoid network censorship. Such protocols are designed to produce messages that appear completely random. This design hides communications metadata, such as version and length fields, and makes it difficult to even determine what protocol is being used. Moreover, these protocols frequently support padding to hide the length of protocol fields and the contained message. These techniques have relevance well beyond censorship circumvention, as protecting protocol metadata has security and privacy benefits for all Internet communications. The security of FEP designs depends on cryptographic assumptions, but neither security definitions nor proofs exist for them. We provide novel security definitions that capture the metadata-protection goals of FEPs. Our definitions are given in both the datastream and datagram settings, which model the ubiquitous TCP and UDP interfaces available to protocol designers. We prove relations among these new notions and existing security definitions. We further present new FEP constructions and prove their security. Finally, we survey existing FEP candidates and characterize the extent to which they satisfy FEP security. We identify novel ways in which these protocols are identifiable, including their responses to the introduction of data errors and the sizes of their smallest protocol messages.",

        "title": "zkLogin: Privacy-Preserving Blockchain Authentication with Existing Credentials",
        "abstract": "For many users, a private key based wallet serves as the primary entry point to blockchains. Commonly recommended wallet authentication methods, such as mnemonics or hardware wallets, can be cumbersome. This difficulty in user onboarding has significantly hindered the adoption of blockchain-based applications. We develop zkLogin, a novel technique that leverages identity tokens issued by popular platforms (any OpenID Connect enabled platform e.g., Google, Facebook, etc.) to authenticate transactions. At the heart of zkLogin lies a signature scheme allowing the signer to sign using their existing OpenID accounts and nothing else. This improves the user experience significantly as users do not need to remember a new secret and can reuse their existing accounts. zkLogin provides strong security and privacy guarantees. Unlike prior works, zkLogin's security relies solely on the underlying platform's authentication mechanism without the need for any additional trusted parties (e.g., trusted hardware or oracles). As the name suggests, zkLogin leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to ensure that the sensitive link between a user's off-chain and on-chain identities is hidden, even from the platform itself. zkLogin enables a number of important applications outside blockchains. It allows billions of users to produce \\textit{verifiable digital content leveraging their existing digital identities}, e.g., email address. For example, a journalist can use zkLogin to sign a news article with their email address, allowing verification of the article's authorship by any party. We have implemented and deployed zkLogin on the Sui blockchain as an additional alternative to traditional digital signature-based addresses.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, extensive research has been conducted on the vulnerability of ASR systems, revealing that black-box adversarial example attacks pose significant threats to real-world ASR systems. However, most existing black-box attacks rely on queries to the target ASRs, which is impractical when queries are not permitted. In this paper, we propose ZQ-Attack, a transfer-based adversarial attack on ASR systems in the zero-query black-box setting. Through a comprehensive review and categorization of modern ASR technologies, we first meticulously select surrogate ASRs of diverse types to generate adversarial examples. Following this, ZQ-Attack initializes the adversarial perturbation with a scaled target command audio, rendering it relatively imperceptible while maintaining effectiveness. Subsequently, to achieve high transferability of adversarial perturbations, we propose a sequential ensemble optimization algorithm, which iteratively optimizes the adversarial perturbation on each surrogate model, leveraging collaborative information from other models. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate ZQ-Attack. In the over-the-line setting, ZQ-Attack achieves a 100% success rate of attack (SRoA) with an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 21.91dB on 4 online speech recognition services, and attains an average SRoA of 100% and SNR of 19.67dB on 16 open-source ASRs. For commercial intelligent voice control devices, ZQ-Attack also achieves a 100% SRoA with an average SNR of 15.77dB in the over-the-air setting.",

        "abstract": "In distributed learning settings, models are iteratively updated with shared gradients computed from potentially sensitive user data. While previous work has studied various privacy risks of sharing gradients, our paper aims to provide a systematic approach to analyze private information leakage from gradients. We present a unified game-based framework that encompasses a broad range of attacks including attribute, property, distributional, and user disclosures. We investigate how different uncertainties of the adversary affect their inferential power via extensive experiments on five datasets across various data modalities. Our results demonstrate the inefficacy of solely relying on data aggregation to achieve privacy against inference attacks in distributed learning. We further evaluate five types of defenses, namely, gradient pruning, signed gradient descent, adversarial perturbations, variational information bottleneck, and differential privacy, under both static and adaptive adversary settings. We provide an information-theoretic view for analyzing the effectiveness of these defenses against inference from gradients. Finally, we introduce a method for auditing attribute inference privacy, improving the empirical estimation of worst-case privacy through crafting adversarial canary records.",

        "title": "Stealing Trust: Unraveling Blind Message Attacks in Web3 Authentication",
        "abstract": "As the field of Web3 continues its rapid expansion, the security of Web3 authentication, often the gateway to various Web3 applications, becomes increasingly crucial. Despite its widespread use as a login method by numerous Web3 applications, the security risks of Web3 authentication have not received much attention. This paper investigates the vulnerabilities in the Web3 authentication process and proposes a new type of attack, dubbed blind message attacks. In blind message attacks, attackers trick users into blindly signing messages from target applications by exploiting users' inability to verify the source of messages, thereby achieving unauthorized access to the target application. We have developed Web3AuthChecker, a dynamic detection tool that interacts with Web3 authentication-related APIs to identify vulnerabilities. Our evaluation of real-world Web3 applications shows that a staggering 75.8% (22/29) of Web3 authentication deployments are at risk of blind message attacks. In response to this alarming situation, we implemented Web3AuthGuard on the open-source wallet MetaMask to alert users of potential attacks. Our evaluation results show that Web3AuthGuard can successfully raise alerts in 80% of the tested Web3 authentications. We have responsibly reported our findings to vulnerable websites and have been assigned two CVE IDs.",

        "title": "Accurate and Efficient Recurring Vulnerability Detection for IoT Firmware",
        "abstract": "IoT firmware faces severe threats to security vulnerabilities. As an important method to detect vulnerabilities, recurring vulnerability detection has not been systematically studied in IoT firmware. In fact, existing methods would meet significant challenges from two aspects. First, firmware vulnerabilities are usually reported in texts without too much code-level information, e.g., security patches. Second, firmware images are released as binaries, making the analysis of known vulnerabilities and the detection of unknown vulnerabilities quite difficult. This paper presents FirmRec, the first recurring vulnerability detection approach for IoT firmware. FirmRec features several new techniques to enable accurate and efficient vulnerability detection. First, it proposes a new exploitation-based vulnerability signature representation for firmware, which does not use syntactic code features but the semantic features along the dynamic vulnerability exploitation procedure (thus is more resilient to binary code changes and fits the context of binary-only firmware). Second, given a vulnerability report, it designs concolic execution-based vulnerability signature extraction to understand the vulnerability exploitation procedure and generate an exploitation-based vulnerability signature. Third, based on known vulnerability signatures, it employs a two-stage pipeline to accurately and efficiently detect recurring vulnerabilities.",

        "abstract": "Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks can effectively identify the websites visited by Tor clients via analyzing encrypted traffic patterns. Existing attacks focus on identifying different websites, but their accuracy dramatically decreases when applied to identify fine-grained webpages, especially when distinguishing among different subpages of the same website. WebPage Fingerprinting (WPF) attacks face the challenges of highly similar traffic patterns and a much larger scale of webpages. Furthermore, clients often visit multiple webpages concurrently, increasing the difficulty of extracting the traffic patterns of each webpage from the obfuscated traffic. In this paper, we propose Oscar, a WPF attack based on multi-label metric learning that identifies different webpages from obfuscated traffic by transforming the feature space. Oscar can extract the subtle differences among various webpages, even those with similar traffic patterns. In particular, Oscar combines proxy-based and sample-based metric learning losses to extract webpage features from obfuscated traffic and identify multiple webpages. We prototype Oscar and evaluate its performance using traffic collected from 1,000 monitored webpages and over 9,000 unmonitored webpages in the real world. Oscar demonstrates an 88.6% improvement in the multi-label metric Recall@5 compared to the state-of-the-art attacks.",

        "title": "Strong Privacy-Preserving Universally Composable AKA Protocol with Seamless Handover Support for Mobile Virtual Network Operator",
        "abstract": "Consumers seeking a new mobile plan have many choices in the present mobile landscape. The Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) has recently gained considerable attention among these options. MVNOs offer various benefits, making them an appealing choice for a majority of consumers. These advantages encompass flexibility, access to cutting-edge technologies, enhanced coverage, superior customer service, and substantial cost savings. Even though MVNO offers several advantages, it also creates some security and privacy concerns for the customer simultaneously. For instance, in the existing solution, MVNO needs to hand over all the sensitive details, including the users' identities and master secret keys of their customers, to a mobile operator (MNO) to validate the customers while offering any services. This allows MNOs to have unrestricted access to the MVNO subscribers' location and mobile data, including voice calls, SMS, and Internet, which the MNOs frequently sell to third parties (e.g., advertisement companies and surveillance agencies) for more profit. Although critical for mass users, such privacy loss has been historically ignored due to the lack of practical and privacy-preserving solutions for registration and handover procedures in cellular networks. In this paper, we propose a universally composable authentication and handover scheme with strong user privacy support, where each MVNO user can validate a mobile operator (MNO) and vice-versa without compromising user anonymity and unlinkability support. Here, we anticipate that our proposed solution will most likely be deployed by the MVNO(s) to ensure enhanced privacy support to their customer(s).",

        "title": "Almost Instance-optimal Clipping for Summation Problems in the Shuffle Model of Differential Privacy",
        "abstract": "Differentially private mechanisms achieving worst-case optimal error bounds (e.g., the classical Laplace mechanism) are well-studied in the literature. However, when typical data are far from the worst case, \\emph{instance-specific} error bounds -- which depend on the largest value in the dataset -- are more meaningful. For example, consider the sum estimation problem, where each user has an integer $x_i$ from the domain $\\{0,1,\\dots,U\\}$ and we wish to estimate $\\sum_i x_i$. This has a worst-case optimal error of $O(U/\\varepsilon)$, while recent work has shown that the clipping mechanism can achieve an instance-optimal error of $O(\\max_i x_i \\cdot \\log\\log U /\\varepsilon)$. Under the shuffle model, known instance-optimal protocols are less communication-efficient. The clipping mechanism also works in the shuffle model, but requires two rounds: Round one finds the clipping threshold, and round two does the clipping and computes the noisy sum of the clipped data. In this paper, we show how these two seemingly sequential steps can be done simultaneously in one round using just $1+o(1)$ messages per user, while maintaining the instance-optimal error bound. We also extend our technique to the high-dimensional sum estimation problem and sparse vector aggregation (a.k.a. frequency estimation under user-level differential privacy).",

        "title": "Fast and Accurate Homomorphic Softmax Evaluation",
        "abstract": "Homomorphic encryption is one of the main solutions for building secure and privacy-preserving solutions for Machine Learning as a Service. This motivates the development of homomorphic algorithms for the main building blocks of AI, typically for the components of the various types of neural networks architectures. Among those components, we focus on the Softmax function, defined by $\\mathrm{SM}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\left(\\exp(x_i) / \\sum_{j=1}^n \\exp(x_j) \\right)_{1\\le i\\le n}$. This function is deemed to be one of the most difficult to evaluate homomorphically, because of its multivariate nature and of the very large range of values for $\\exp(x_i)$. The available homomorphic algorithms remain restricted, especially in large dimensions, while important applications such as Large Language Models (LLM) require computing Softmax over large dimensional vectors. In terms of multiplicative depth of the computation (a suitable measure of cost for homomorphic algorithms), our algorithm achieves $O(\\log n)$ complexity for a fixed range of inputs, where $n$ is the Softmax dimension. Our algorithm is especially adapted to the situation where we must compute many Softmax at the same time, for instance, in the LLM situation. In that case, assuming that all Softmax calls are packed into $m$ ciphtertexts, the asymptotic amortized multiplicative depth cost per ciphertext is, again over a fixed range, $O(1 + m/N)$ for $N$ the homomorphic ring degree. The main ingredient of our algorithms is a normalize-and-square strategy, which interlaces the exponential computation over a large range and normalization, decomposing both in stabler and cheaper smaller steps. Comparing ourselves to the state of the art, our experiments show, in practice, a good accuracy and a gain of a factor 2.5 to 8 compared to state of the art solutions.",

        "abstract": "Phishing on the web is a model of social engineering and an attack vector for getting access to sensitive and financial data of individuals and corporations. Phishing has been identified as one of the prime cyber threats in recent years. With the goal to effectively identify and mitigate phishing as early as possible, we present in this paper a longitudinal analysis of phishing attacks from the vantage point of three country-code top-level domain (ccTLD) registries that manage more than 8 million active domains \u2013 namely the Netherlands\u2019 .nl , Ireland\u2019s .ie , and Belgium\u2019s .be . We perform a longitudinal analysis on phishing attacks spanning up to 10 years, based on more than 28 thousand phishing domains. Our results show two major attack strategies: national companies and organizations are far more often impersonated using malicious registered domains under their country\u2019s own ccTLD, which enables better mimicry of the impersonated company. In stark contrast, international companies are impersonated using any domains that can be compromised, reducing overall mimicry but bearing no registration and financial costs. Although most research works focus on detecting new domain names, we show that 80% of phishing attacks in the studied ccTLDs employ compromised domain names. We find banks, financial institutions, and high-tech giant companies at the top of the most impersonated targets. We also show the impact of ccTLDs\u2019 registration and abuse handling policies on preventing and mitigating phishing attacks, and that mitigation is complex and performed at both web and DNS level at different intermediaries. Last, our results provide a unique opportunity for ccTLDs to compare and revisit their policies and impacts, with the goal of improving mitigation procedures.",

        "title": "Distributed Backdoor Attacks on Federated Graph Learning and Certified Defenses",
        "abstract": "Federated graph learning (FedGL) is an emerging federated learning (FL) framework that extends FL to learn graph data from diverse sources. FL for non-graph data has shown to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which inject a shared backdoor trigger into the training data such that the trained backdoored FL model can predict the testing data containing the trigger as the attacker desires. However, FedGL against backdoor attacks is largely unexplored, and no effective defense exists. In this paper, we aim to address such significant deficiency. First, we propose an effective, stealthy, and persistent backdoor attack on FedGL. Our attack uses a subgraph as the trigger and designs an adaptive trigger generator that can derive the effective trigger location and shape for each graph. Our attack shows that empirical defenses are hard to detect/remove our generated triggers. To mitigate it, we further develop a certified defense for any backdoored FedGL model against the trigger with any shape at any location. Our defense involves carefully dividing a testing graph into multiple subgraphs and designing a majority vote-based ensemble classifier on these subgraphs. We then derive the deterministic certified robustness based on the ensemble classifier and prove its tightness. We extensively evaluate our attack and defense on six graph datasets. Our attack results show our attack can obtain>90% backdoor accuracy in almost all datasets. Our defense results show, in certain cases, the certified accuracy for clean testing graphs against an arbitrary trigger with size 20 can be close to the normal accuracy under no attack, while there is a moderate gap in other cases. Moreover, the certified backdoor accuracy is always 0 for backdoored testing graphs generated by our attack, implying our defense can fully mitigate the attack.

        "abstract": "Mini-programs are lightweight apps running in super apps (such as WeChat, Baidu, Alipay, and TikTok), an emerging paradigm in the era of mobile computing. With the growing popularity of mini-programs, there is an increasing concern for their security and privacy. In essence, mini-programs are WebView-based apps. This means that they may be vulnerable to the same security risks associated with web apps. In this work, we discovered a new mini-program vulnerability called MiniCPRF (Cross-Page Request Forgery in Mini-Programs). The exploit of this vulnerability is easy, and the attack consequences are severe, leading to unauthorized operations, such as free shopping, and the exposure of confidential information, such as credit card numbers. The root causes of MiniCPRF can be attributed to multiple design flaws in both mini-programs and their super apps, including the insecure routing mechanism, lack of message integrity check, and plain-text storage. To evaluate the impacts of MiniCPRF, we designed an automated analysis framework called MiniCAT. It can automatically crawl mini-programs, perform static analysis on them",

        "abstract": "The emergence of decentralized finance has transformed asset trading on the blockchain, making traditional financial instruments more accessible while also introducing a series of exploitative economic practices known as Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). Concurrently, decentralized finance has embraced rollup-based Layer-2 solutions to facilitate asset trading at reduced transaction costs compared to Layer-1 solutions such as Ethereum. However, rollups lack a public mempool like Ethereum, making the extraction of MEV more challenging. In this paper, we investigate the prevalence and impact of MEV on Ethereum and prominent rollups such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync over a nearly three-year period. Our analysis encompasses various metrics including volume, profits, costs, competition, and response time to MEV opportunities. We discover that MEV is widespread on rollups, with trading volume comparable to Ethereum. We also find that, although MEV costs are lower on rollups, profits are also significantly lower compared to Ethereum. Additionally, we examine the prevalence of sandwich attacks on rollups. While our findings did not detect any sandwiching activity on popular rollups, we did identify the potential for cross-layer sandwich attacks facilitated by transactions that are sent across rollups and Ethereum. Consequently, we propose and evaluate the feasibility of three novel attacks that exploit cross-layer transactions, revealing that attackers could have already earned approximately 2 million USD through cross-layer sandwich attacks.",

        "abstract": "Given the societal impact of unsafe content generated by large language models (LLMs), ensuring that LLM services comply with safety standards is a crucial concern for LLM service providers. Common content moderation methods are limited by an effectiveness-and-efficiency dilemma, where simple models are fragile while sophisticated models consume excessive computational resources. In this paper, we reveal for the first time that effective and efficient content moderation can be achieved by extracting conceptual features from chat-oriented LLMs, despite their initial fine-tuning for conversation rather than content moderation. We propose a practical and unified content moderation framework for LLM services, named Legilimens, which features both effectiveness and efficiency. Our red-team model-based data augmentation enhances the robustness of Legilimens against state-of-the-art jailbreaking. Additionally, we develop a framework to theoretically analyze the cost-effectiveness of Legilimens compared to other methods. We have conducted extensive experiments on five host LLMs, seventeen datasets, and nine jailbreaking methods to verify the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of Legilimens against normal and adaptive adversaries. A comparison of Legilimens with both commercial and academic baselines demonstrates the superior performance of Legilimens. Furthermore, we confirm that Legilimens can be applied to few-shot scenarios and extended to multi-label classification tasks.",

Utility requirements for such queries necessitate the need for private mechanisms that guarantee a bound on the false negative and false positive errors. This paper formally defines complex decision support queries and their accuracy requirements, and provides algorithms that proportion the existing budget to optimally minimize privacy loss while supporting a bounded guarantee on the accuracy. Our experimental results on multiple real-life datasets show that our algorithms successfully maintain such utility guarantees, while also minimizing privacy loss.",

        "abstract": "Metaverses are virtual worlds where users can engage in social exchanges, collaborate, or play games. Their clients now are JavaScript programs that run inside modern web browsers. They implement functionalities typical of multiplayer video games, like 3D and physics engines, requiring them to maintain complex data structures of objects in the browser\u2019s memory. Unfortunately, these objects can be accessed and manipulated by malicious users, allowing them to learn about events beyond the ones rendered on screen or to hijack the physics of the metaverse to spy on other users. In this paper, we propose one of the first comprehensive security assessments for web clients of metaverse platforms. We begin with a survey and selection of three metaverse platforms and introduce a software-centric threat modeling approach designed to identify the security-relevant entities. Then, we propose a JavaScript global object snapshot diffing technique to identify in-memory objects correlated with the attribute and design 10 attacks, of which eight successfully executed against at least one of the metaverses, enabling a malicious user to perform audio/video surveillance or continuous user position tracking \u2014 to mention a few \u2014 who could exacerbate current threats posed by stalkers and online abusers. Finally, we discuss the implications of our attacks should the metaverse become a business tool and possible solutions.",

        "abstract": "The ongoing deprecation of third-party cookies by web browser vendors has sparked the proposal of alternative methods to support more privacy-preserving personalized advertising on web browsers and applications. The Topics API is being proposed by Google to provide third-parties with\"coarse-grained advertising topics that the page visitor might currently be interested in\". In this paper, we analyze the re-identification risks for individual Internet users and the utility provided to advertising companies by the Topics API, i.e. learning the most popular topics and distinguishing between real and random topics. We provide theoretical results dependent only on the API parameters that can be readily applied to evaluate the privacy and utility implications of future API updates, including novel general upper-bounds that account for adversaries with access to unknown, arbitrary side information, the value of the differential privacy parameter $\\epsilon$, and experimental results on real-world data that validate our theoretical model.",

        "title": "ProphetFuzz: Fully Automated Prediction and Fuzzing of High-Risk Option Combinations with Only Documentation via Large Language Model",
        "abstract": "Vulnerabilities related to option combinations pose a significant challenge in software security testing due to their vast search space. Previous research primarily addressed this challenge through mutation or filtering techniques, which inefficiently treated all option combinations as having equal potential for vulnerabilities, thus wasting considerable time on non-vulnerable targets and resulting in low testing efficiency. In this paper, we utilize carefully designed prompt engineering to drive the large language model (LLM) to predict high-risk option combinations (i.e., more likely to contain vulnerabilities) and perform fuzz testing automatically without human intervention. We developed a tool called ProphetFuzz and evaluated it on a dataset comprising 52 programs collected from three related studies. The entire experiment consumed 10.44 CPU years. ProphetFuzz successfully predicted 1748 high-risk option combinations at an average cost of only \\$8.69 per program. Results show that after 72 hours of fuzzing, ProphetFuzz discovered 364 unique vulnerabilities associated with 12.30\\% of the predicted high-risk option combinations, which was 32.85\\% higher than that found by state-of-the-art in the same timeframe. Additionally, using ProphetFuzz, we conducted persistent fuzzing on the latest versions of these programs, uncovering 140 vulnerabilities, with 93 confirmed by developers and 21 awarded CVE numbers.",

        "abstract": "The growing use of large language model (LLM)-based conversational agents to manage sensitive user data raises significant privacy concerns. While these agents excel at understanding and acting on context, this capability can be exploited by malicious actors. We introduce a novel threat model where adversarial third-party apps manipulate the context of interaction to trick LLM-based agents into revealing private information not relevant to the task at hand. Grounded in the framework of contextual integrity, we introduce AirGapAgent, a privacy-conscious agent designed to prevent unintended data leakage by restricting the agent's access to only the data necessary for a specific task. Extensive experiments using Gemini, GPT, and Mistral models as agents validate our approach's effectiveness in mitigating this form of context hijacking while maintaining core agent functionality. For example, we show that a single-query context hijacking attack on a Gemini Ultra agent reduces its ability to protect user data from 94% to 45%, while an AirGapAgent achieves 97% protection, rendering the same attack ineffective.",

We discuss the unique impact of this RCE on networks that use RPKI, illustrating that RCE vulnerabilities are especially severe in the context of RPKI. The design of RPKI makes RCE easy to exploit on a large scale, allows compromise of RPKI validation integrity, and enables a powerful vector for additional attacks on other critical components of the network, like the border routers. We analyze the vulnerability exposing to this RCE and identify indications that the discovered vulnerability could constitute an intentional backdoor to compromise systems running the software over a benign coding mistake. We disclosed the vulnerability, which has been assigned a CVE rated 9.8 critical (CVE-2024-45237).",

        "abstract": "Password masking, a practice where passwords are obscured during entry, is widely adopted for online authentication. However, its merits have been debated for over a decade, with questions about its security benefits and concerns about its usability impact. Yet to date, masking has received limited prior exploration. In this work, we empirically investigate the security and usability impact of password masking. We first assess the masking practices of popular browsers and websites, demonstrating masking\u2019s ubiquity as well as its design diversity. Guided by our real-world observations, we then conduct a mixed-method evaluation of masking for both mobile and PC devices, combining a survey of over 200 participants on their experiences with and perspectives on masking along with user experiments of 600 participants performing pass-word logins under varying masking conditions. Through our study, we uncover misconceptions about masking, masking\u2019s usability and security impact, and user preferences on masking\u2019s use and its design. Ultimately, our study establishes empirical grounding on how this popular technique manifests in practice, providing recommendations for its use moving forward.",

        "abstract": "While Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) have emerged as a prominent way for hardware-assisted confidential computing, their primary usage is not suitable for small, specialized, security-critical workloads, i.e., legacy VMs with their conventional OS distributions result in a large trusted computing base. In this paper, we present the Gramine-TDX OS kernel to execute slim, single-purpose, security-first, unmodified Linux workloads with a minimal attack surface. In comparison to a typical Linux kernel, Gramine-TDX\u2019s codebase is \u223c 50 \u00d7 less in binary size and has a significantly smaller attack surface, which makes it a perfect match for emerging cloud-native confidential-computing workloads. Our evaluation on 11 workloads indicates that Gramine-TDX has 1-25% average overhead for CPU-and memory-intensive applications. Performance on network-and FS-intensive applications can drop to 6% of the native application\u2019s, as Gramine-TDX prioritizes security over optimizations in virtual hardware communication. We build our prototype using Intel\u00aeTrust Domain Extensions (TDX).",

        "abstract": "We introduce the first candidate Lattice-based designated verifier (DV) zero knowledge sUccinct Non-interactive Argument (ZK-SNARG) protocol, named LUNA, with quasi-optimal proof length (quasi-linear in the security/privacy parameter). By simply relying on mildly stronger security assumptions, LUNA is also a candidate ZK-SNARK (i.e. argument of knowledge). LUNA achieves significant improvements in concrete proof sizes, reaching below 6 KB (compared to > 32 KB in prior work) for 128-bit security/privacy level. To achieve our quasi-optimal succinct LUNA, we give a new regularity result for \u2018private\u2019 re-randomization of Module LWE (MLWE) samples using discrete Gaussian randomization vectors, also known as a lattice-based leftover hash lemma with leakage, which applies with a discrete Gaussian re-randomization parameter that is polynomial in the statistical privacy parameter (avoiding exponential smudging), and hides the coset of the re-randomization vector support set. Along the way, we derive bounds on the smoothing parameter of the intersection of short integer solution (SIS), gadget, and Gaussian perp module lattices over the power of 2 cy-clotomic rings. We then introduce a new candidate linear-only homomorphic encryption scheme called Module Half-GSW (HGSW), and apply our regularity theorem to provide smudging-free circuit-private homomorphic linear operations for Module HGSW. Our implementation and experimental performance evaluation show that, for typical instance sizes, Module HGSW provides favourable performance for ZK-SNARG applications involving lightweight verifiers. It enables significantly (around 5 \u00d7 ) shorter proof lengths while speeding up CRS generation and encryption time by 4 \u2212 16 \u00d7 and speeding up decryption time by 4 . 3 \u00d7 , while incurring just 1 . 2 \u2212 2 \u00d7 time overhead in linear homomorphic proof generation operations, compared to a Regev encryption used in prior work in the ZK-SNARG context. We believe our techniques are of independent interest and will find application in other privacy-preserving applications of lattice-based cryptography",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enhanced by differential privacy has emerged as a popular approach to better safeguard the privacy of client-side data by protecting clients' contributions during the training process. Existing solutions typically assume a uniform privacy budget for all records and provide one-size-fits-all solutions that may not be adequate to meet each record's privacy requirement. In this paper, we explore the uncharted territory of cross-silo FL with record-level personalized differential privacy. We devise a novel framework named \\textit{rPDP-FL}, employing a two-stage hybrid sampling scheme with both uniform client-level sampling and non-uniform record-level sampling to accommodate varying privacy requirements. A critical and non-trivial problem is how to determine the ideal per-record sampling probability $q$ given the personalized privacy budget $\\varepsilon$. We introduce a versatile solution named \\textit{Simulation-CurveFitting}, allowing us to uncover a significant insight into the nonlinear correlation between $q$ and $\\varepsilon$ and derive an elegant mathematical model to tackle the problem. Our evaluation demonstrates that our solution can provide significant performance gains over the baselines that do not consider personalized privacy preservation.",

        "title": "PLeak: Prompt Leaking Attacks against Large Language Model Applications",
        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) enable a new ecosystem with many downstream applications, called LLM applications, with different natural language processing tasks. The functionality and performance of an LLM application highly depend on its system prompt, which instructs the backend LLM on what task to perform. Therefore, an LLM application developer often keeps a system prompt confidential to protect its intellectual property. As a result, a natural attack, called prompt leaking, is to steal the system prompt from an LLM application, which compromises the developer's intellectual property. Existing prompt leaking attacks primarily rely on manually crafted queries, and thus achieve limited effectiveness. In this paper, we design a novel, closed-box prompt leaking attack framework, called PLeak, to optimize an adversarial query such that when the attacker sends it to a target LLM application, its response reveals its own system prompt. We formulate finding such an adversarial query as an optimization problem and solve it with a gradient-based method approximately. Our key idea is to break down the optimization goal by optimizing adversary queries for system prompts incrementally, i.e., starting from the first few tokens of each system prompt step by step until the entire length of the system prompt. We evaluate PLeak in both offline settings and for real-world LLM applications, e.g., those on Poe, a popular platform hosting such applications. Our results show that PLeak can effectively leak system prompts and significantly outperforms not only baselines that manually curate queries but also baselines with optimized queries that are modified and adapted from existing jailbreaking attacks. We responsibly reported the issues to Poe and are still waiting for their response. Our implementation is available at this repository: https://github.com/BHui97/PLeak.",

        "abstract": "How will future microarchitectures impact the security of existing cryptographic implementations? As we cannot keep reducing the size of transistors, chip vendors have started developing new microarchitectural optimizations to speed up computation. A recent study (Sanchez Vicarte et al., ISCA 2021) suggests that these optimizations might open the Pandora's box of microarchitectural attacks. However, there is little guidance on how to evaluate the security impact of future optimization proposals. To help chip vendors explore the impact of microarchitectural optimizations on cryptographic implementations, we develop (i) an expressive domain-specific language, called LmSpec, that allows them to specify the leakage model for the given optimization and (ii) a testing framework, called LmTest, to automatically detect leaks under the specified leakage model within the given implementation. Using this framework, we conduct an empirical study of 18 proposed microarchitectural optimizations on 25 implementations of eight cryptographic primitives in five popular libraries. We find that every implementation would contain secret-dependent leaks, sometimes sufficient to recover a victim's secret key, if these optimizations were realized. Ironically, some leaks are possible only because of coding idioms used to prevent leaks under the standard constant-time model.",

        "title": "Characterizing Ethereum Address Poisoning Attack",
        "abstract": "This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of the address poisoning attack surged on the Ethereum blockchain. This phishing attack typically exploits the address shortening feature of Ethereum explorers and digital wallets (e.g., Etherscan and MetaMask) by crafting token transfer events with a seemingly correct address to poison victims\u2019 transfer history, waiting for them to mistakenly transfer assets to the attacker\u2019s address. To systematically detect and characterize the address poisoning attack, we developed a detection system named Poison-Hunter , which can recognize the attacker\u2019s crafted transfers and detect the phishing addresses controlled by the attacker. By applying Poison-Hunter to Ethereum blocks produced from Nov. 2022 to Feb. 2024, we have detected millions of phishing transfers and phishing addresses. Our analysis shows that the attacker has predominantly targeted USDC and USDT token holders and used a phishing address that looks highly similar to a benign one. We also find that the sender of legitimate transfers was the primary target of this attack. Furthermore, by tracing the transaction history of the detected phishing addresses, we reveal that over 1,800 victim addresses have lost crypto assets, with a potential financial loss of up to $144 million US dollars. Among them, about $90 million of loss are confirmed by this work. Finally, our analysis suggests that 98% of phishing addresses are controlled by four entities, which collected nearly 92% of the total profits. Overall, this paper sheds light on the tactics utilized in the address poisoning attack and its scale and impact on the Ethereum blockchain, emphasizing the urgent need for an effective detection and prevention mechanism against such a phishing activity.",

        "title": "BinPRE: Enhancing Field Inference in Binary Analysis Based Protocol Reverse Engineering",
        "abstract": "Protocol reverse engineering (PRE) aims to infer the specification of network protocols when the source code is not available. Specifically, field inference is one crucial step in PRE to infer the field formats and semantics. To perform field inference, binary analysis based PRE techniques are one major approach category. However, such techniques face two key challenges - (1) the format inference is fragile when the logics of processing input messages may vary among different protocol implementations, and (2) the semantic inference is limited by inadequate and inaccurate inference rules. To tackle these challenges, we present BinPRE, a binary analysis based PRE tool. BinPRE incorporates (1) an instruction-based semantic similarity analysis strategy for format extraction; (2) a novel library composed of atomic semantic detectors for improving semantic inference adequacy; and (3) a cluster-and-refine paradigm to further improve semantic inference accuracy. We have evaluated BinPRE against five existing PRE tools, including Polyglot, AutoFormat, Tupni, BinaryInferno and DynPRE. The evaluation results on eight widely-used protocols show that BinPRE outperforms the prior PRE tools in both format and semantic inference. BinPRE achieves the perfection of 0.73 on format extraction and the F1-score of 0.74 (0.81) on semantic inference of types (functions), respectively. The field inference results of BinPRE have helped improve the effectiveness of protocol fuzzing by achieving 5-29% higher branch coverage, compared to those of the best prior PRE tool. BinPRE has also helped discover one new zero-day vulnerability, which otherwise cannot be found.",

        "abstract": "Decompilation aims to recover a binary executable to the source code form and hence has a wide range of applications in cyber security, such as malware analysis and legacy code hardening. A prominent challenge is to recover variable symbols, including both primitive and complex types such as user-defined data structures, along with their symbol information such as names and types. Existing efforts focus on solving parts of the problem, e.g., recovering only types (without names) or only local variables (without user-defined structures). In this paper, we propose ReSym, a novel hybrid technique that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and program analysis to recover both names and types for local variables and user-defined data structures. Our method encompasses fine-tuning two LLMs to handle local variables and structures, respectively. To overcome the inherent token limitations in current LLMs, we devise a novel Prolog-based algorithm to aggregate and cross-check results from multiple LLM queries, suppressing uncertainty and hallucinations. Our experiments show that ReSym is effective in recovering variable information and user-defined data structures, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Solana gained considerable attention as one of the most popular blockchain platforms for deploying decentralized applications. Compared to Ethereum, however, we observe a lack of research on how Solana smart contract developers handle security, what challenges they encounter, and how this affects the overall security of the ecosystem. To address this, we conducted the first comprehensive study on the Solana platform consisting of a 90-minute Solana smart contract code review task with 35 participants followed by interviews with a subset of seven participants. Our study shows, quite alarmingly, that none of the participants could detect all important security vulnerabilities in a code review task and that 83% of the participants are likely to release vulnerable smart contracts. Our study also sheds light on the root causes of developers' challenges with Solana smart contract development, suggesting the need for better security guidance and resources. In spite of these challenges, our automated analysis on currently deployed Solana smart contracts surprisingly suggests that the prevalence of vulnerabilities - especially those pointed out as the most challenging in our developer study - is below 0.3%. We explore the causes of this counter-intuitive resilience and show that frameworks, such as Anchor, are aiding Solana developers in deploying secure contracts.",

        "abstract": "Restricting dangling pointers from accessing freed memory is a promising technique for mitigating use-after-free vulnerabilities in memory-unsafe programming languages. However, existing solutions suffer from high performance overheads, as they rely on conventional page table manipulation to make dangling pointers inaccessible. In this paper, we present Safeslab : a heap-hardening extension that aims to mitigate use-after-free vulnerabilities via a novel and efficient address aliasing approach. Safeslab assigns multiple virtual aliases to each memory page in the system, and manages their access rights via the recently introduced Memory Protection Keys hardware extension, which is designed to provide a fast alternative to page tables for memory management. This allows Safeslab to drastically reduce the number of page table modifications, while blocking dangling pointers efficiently. We integrated Safeslab into the Linux kernel, replacing its default heap allocator ( SLUB ). The results of our experimental evaluation with real-world benchmarks show that Safeslab incurs a negligible runtime overhead of up to 4% and moderate memory waste.",

        "abstract": "Compileroptimizationsintendtotransforma programinto asemantic-equivalent one with improved performance, but it is unclear how these optimizations may impact the performance of dynamic symbolic execution (DSE) on binary code. To systematically understand the impact of compiler optimizations on two popular DSE techniques (i.e., symbolic exploration and symbolic tracing), this paper presents an empirical study that quantifies 209 GCC compilation flags and 73 Clang compilation flags to reveal both positive and negative optimizations to DSE. Our data set contains 992 unique test cases, which are produced from 3 , 449 source files in the GCC test suite. After analyzing 2 , 978 , 976 binary programs that we compiled with two compilers and various compilation flags, we found that although some optimizations make DSE faster, most optimizations will actually slow down DSE. Our analysis further reveals root causes behind these impacts. The most positive impacts that optimizations have on DSE come from the reduction of the number of instructions and program paths, whereas negative impacts are caused by a series of unexpected behaviors, including increased numbers of instructions or program paths, library function inlining preventing DSE engines from using function summaries, and arithmetic optimizations leading to more sophisticated constraints. Being the first in-depth analysis on why compiler flags influence the performance of DSE, this project sheds light on program transformations that can be applied before performing DSE tasks for better performance.",

        "abstract": "Oblivious RAM (ORAM) allows a client to securely outsource memory storage to an untrusted server. It has been shown that no ORAM can simultaneously achieve small bandwidth blow-up, small client storage, and a single roundtrip of latency. We consider a weakening of the RAM model, which we call the Single Access Machine (SAM) model. In the SAM model, each memory slot can be written to at most once and read from at most once. We adapt existing tree-based ORAM to obtain an oblivious SAM (OSAM) that has \ud835\udc42 ( log \ud835\udc5b ) bandwidth blow-up (which we show is optimal), small client storage, and a single roundtrip. OSAM unlocks improvements to oblivious data structures/algorithms. For instance, we achieve oblivious unbalanced binary trees (e.g. tries, splay trees). By leveraging splay trees, we obtain a notion of caching ORAM , where an access in the worst case incurs amortized \ud835\udc42 ( log 2 \ud835\udc5b ) bandwidth blow-up and \ud835\udc42 ( log \ud835\udc5b ) roundtrips, but in many common cases (e.g. sequential scans) incurs only amortized \ud835\udc42 ( log \ud835\udc5b ) bandwidth blow-up and \ud835\udc42 ( 1 ) roundtrips. We also give new oblivious graph algorithms, including computing minimum spanning trees and single source shortest paths, in which the OSAM client reads/writes \ud835\udc42 (| \ud835\udc38 | \u00b7 log | \ud835\udc38 |) words using \ud835\udc42 (| \ud835\udc38 |) roundtrips, where | \ud835\udc38 | is the number of edges. This improves over prior custom solutions by a log factor. At a higher level, OSAM provides a general model for oblivious computation. We construct a programming interface around OSAM that supports arbitrary pointer-manipulating programs such that dereferencing a pointer to an object incurs \ud835\udc42 ( log \ud835\udc51 log \ud835\udc5b ) bandwidth blowup and \ud835\udc42 ( log \ud835\udc51 ) roundtrips, where \ud835\udc51 is the number of pointers to that object. This new interface captures a wide variety of data structures and algorithms (e.g.,",

        "abstract": "Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is a crucial defense mechanism employed by modern operating systems to mitigate exploitation by randomizing processes' memory layouts. However, the stark reality is that real-world implementations of ASLR are imperfect and subject to weaknesses that attackers can exploit. This work evaluates the effectiveness of ASLR on major desktop platforms, including Linux, MacOS, and Windows, by examining the variability in the placement of memory objects across various processes, threads, and system restarts. In particular, we collect samples of memory object locations, conduct statistical analyses to measure the randomness of these placements and examine the memory layout to find any patterns among objects that could decrease this randomness. The results show that while some systems, like Linux distributions, provide robust randomization, others, like Windows and MacOS, often fail to adequately randomize key areas like executable code and libraries. Moreover, we find a significant entropy reduction in the entropy of libraries after the Linux 5.18 version and identify correlation paths that an attacker could leverage to reduce exploitation complexity significantly. Ultimately, we rank the identified weaknesses based on severity and validate our entropy estimates with a proof-of-concept attack. In brief, this paper provides the first comprehensive evaluation of ASLR effectiveness across different operating systems and highlights opportunities for Operating System (OS) vendors to strengthen ASLR implementations.",

        "title": "Employees' Attitudes towards Phishing Simulations: \"It's like when a child reaches onto the hot hob\"",
        "abstract": "E-mail phishing attacks remain one of the most significant challenges in IT security and are often used for initial access. Many organizations rely on phishing simulations to educate their staff to recognize suspicious e-mails. Previous studies have analyzed the effectiveness of these phishing simulations with mixed findings. However, the perception of and attitudes towards phishing simulations among staff have received little to no attention. This paper presents findings from a study that we carried out in co-operation with a multinational company that conducted phishing simulations over more than 12 months. We first conducted a quantitative survey involving 757 employees and then qualitative interviews with 22 participants to gain deeper insights into the perception of phishing simulations and the corresponding e-learning. We could not find evidence that employees feel attacked by their organization, as previous studies suspected. On the contrary, we found that a majority (86.9%) have a positive or very positive attitude towards phishing simulations. The interviews revealed that some employees developed new routines for e-mail processing, but most describe themselves as having become more vigilant without concrete changes. Furthermore, we found evidence that phishing simulations create a false sense of security, as the employees feel protected by them. Additionally, a lack of communication and feed-back can negatively impact employees\u2019 attitudes and lead to adverse consequences. Finally, we show that only a small portion of the employees who clicked on the phishing website interacted with the interactive e-learning elements, which raises questions about its objective usefulness, although they are perceived as useful",

        "abstract": "The Computationally Complete Symbolic Attacker (CCSA) approach to security protocol verification relies on probabilistic logics to reason about the interaction traces between a protocol and an arbitrary adversary. The proof assistant Sqirrel implements one such logic. CCSA logics come with cryptographic axioms whose soundness derives from the security of standard cryptographic games, e.g. PRF, EUF, IND-CCA. Unfortunately, these axioms are complex to design and implement; so far, these tasks are manual, ad hoc and error-prone. We solve these issues by providing a formal and systematic method for deriving axioms from cryptographic games. Our method relies on synthesizing an adversary against some cryptographic game, through the notion of bi-deduction. Con-cretely, we define a rich notion of bi-deduction, justify how to use it to derive cryptographic axioms, provide a proof system for bi-deduction, and an automatic proof-search method which we implemented in Sqirrel.",

        "title": "DarthShader: Fuzzing WebGPU Shader Translators & Compilers",
        "abstract": "A recent trend towards running more demanding web applications, such as video games or client-side LLMs, in the browser has led to the adoption of the WebGPU standard that provides a cross-platform API exposing the GPU to websites. This opens up a new attack surface: Untrusted web content is passed through to the GPU stack, which traditionally has been optimized for performance instead of security. Worsening the problem, most of WebGPU cannot be run in the tightly sandboxed process that manages other web content, which eases the attacker's path to compromising the client machine. Contrasting its importance, WebGPU shader processing has received surprisingly little attention from the automated testing community. Part of the reason is that shader translators expect highly structured and statically typed input, which renders typical fuzzing mutations ineffective. Complicating testing further, shader translation consists of a complex multi-step compilation pipeline, each stage presenting unique requirements and challenges. In this paper, we propose DarthShader, the first language fuzzer that combines mutators based on an intermediate representation with those using a more traditional abstract syntax tree. The key idea is that the individual stages of the shader compilation pipeline are susceptible to different classes of faults, requiring entirely different mutation strategies for thorough testing. By fuzzing the full pipeline, we ensure that we maintain a realistic attacker model. In an empirical evaluation, we show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art fuzzers regarding code coverage. Furthermore, an extensive ablation study validates our key design. DarthShader found a total of 39 software faults in all modern browsers -- Chrome, Firefox, and Safari -- that prior work missed. For 15 of them, the Chrome team assigned a CVE, acknowledging the impact of our results.",

        "title": "Unveiling the Vulnerability of Private Fine-Tuning in Split-Based Frameworks for Large Language Models: A Bidirectionally Enhanced Attack",
        "abstract": "Recent advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have significantly influenced various domains. Adapting these models for specific tasks often involves fine-tuning (FT) with private, domain-specific data. However, privacy concerns keep this data undisclosed, and the computational demands for deploying LLMs pose challenges for resource-limited data holders. This has sparked interest in split learning (SL), a Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) paradigm that divides LLMs into smaller segments for distributed training and deployment, transmitting only intermediate activations instead of raw data. SL has garnered substantial interest in both industry and academia as it aims to balance user data privacy, model ownership, and resource challenges in the private fine-tuning of LLMs. Despite its privacy claims, this paper reveals significant vulnerabilities arising from the combination of SL and LLM-FT: the Not-too-far property of fine-tuning and the auto-regressive nature of LLMs. Exploiting these vulnerabilities, we propose Bidirectional Semi-white-box Reconstruction (BiSR), the first data reconstruction attack (DRA) designed to target both the forward and backward propagation processes of SL. BiSR utilizes pre-trained weights as prior knowledge, combining a learning-based attack with a bidirectional optimization-based approach for highly effective data reconstruction. Additionally, it incorporates a Noise-adaptive Mixture of Experts (NaMoE) model to enhance reconstruction performance under perturbation. We conducted systematic experiments on various mainstream LLMs and different setups, empirically demonstrating BiSR's state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we thoroughly examined three representative defense mechanisms, showcasing our method's capability to reconstruct private data even in the presence of these defenses.",

        "abstract": "Undefined behavior in C often causes devastating security vulnerabilities. One practical mitigation is compartmentalization, which allows developers to structure large programs into mutually distrustful compartments with clearly specified privileges and interactions. In this paper we introduce SECOMP, a compiler for compartmentalized C code that comes with machine-checked proofs guaranteeing that the scope of undefined behavior is restricted to the compartments that encounter it and become dynamically compromised. These guarantees are formalized as the preservation of safety properties against adversarial contexts, a secure compilation criterion similar to full abstraction, and this is the first time such a strong criterion is proven for a mainstream programming language. To achieve this we extend the languages of the CompCert verified C compiler with isolated compartments that can only interact via procedure calls and returns, as specified by cross-compartment interfaces. We adapt the passes and optimizations of CompCert as well as their correctness proofs to this compartment-aware setting. We then use compiler correctness as an ingredient in a larger secure compilation proof that involves several proof engineering novelties, needed to scale formally secure compilation up to a C compiler.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have opened up vast application prospects, such as swarm control of drones, collaborative manipulation by robotic arms, and multi-target encirclement. However, potential security threats during the MARL deployment need more attention and thorough investigation. Recent research reveals that attackers can rapidly exploit the victim's vulnerabilities, generating adversarial policies that result in the failure of specific tasks. For instance, reducing the winning rate of a superhuman-level Go AI to around 20%. Existing studies predominantly focus on two-player competitive environments, assuming attackers possess complete global state observation. In this study, we unveil, for the first time, the capability of attackers to generate adversarial policies even when restricted to partial observations of the victims in multi-agent competitive environments. Specifically, we propose a novel black-box attack (SUB-PLAY) that incorporates the concept of constructing multiple subgames to mitigate the impact of partial observability and suggests sharing transitions among subpolicies to improve attackers' exploitative ability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of SUB-PLAY under three typical partial observability limitations. Visualization results indicate that adversarial policies induce significantly different activations of the victims' policy networks. Furthermore, we evaluate three potential defenses aimed at exploring ways to mitigate security threats posed by adversarial policies, providing constructive recommendations for deploying MARL in competitive environments.",

        "title": "No Peer, no Cry: Network Application Fuzzing via Fault Injection",
        "abstract": "Network-facing applications are commonly exposed to all kinds of attacks, especially when connected to the internet. As a result, web servers like Nginx or client applications such as curl make every effort to secure and harden their code to rule out memory safety violations. One would expect this to include regular fuzz testing, as fuzzing has proven to be one of the most successful approaches to uncovering bugs in software. Yet, surprisingly little research has focused on fuzzing network applications. When studying the underlying reasons, we find that the interactive nature of communication, its statefulness, and the protection of exchanged messages render typical fuzzers ineffective. Attempts to replay recorded messages or modify them on the fly only work for specific targets and often lead to early termination of communication. In this paper, we discuss these challenges in detail, highlighting how the focus of existing work on protocol state space promises little relief. We propose a fundamentally different approach that relies on fault injection rather than modifying messages. Effectively, we force one of the communication peers into a weird state where its output no longer matches the expectations of the target peer, potentially uncovering bugs. Importantly, this weird peer can still properly encrypt/sign the protocol message, overcoming a fundamental challenge of current fuzzers. In effect, we leave the communication system intact but introduce small corruptions. Since we can turn either the server or the client into the weird peer, our approach is the first that can effectively test client-side network applications. Evaluating 16 targets, we show that Fuzztruction-Net outperforms other fuzzers in terms of coverage and bugs found. Overall, Fuzztruction-Net uncovered 23 new bugs in well-tested software, such as the web servers Nginx and Apache HTTPd and the OpenSSH client.",

        "abstract": "We present Moderator, a policy-based model management system that allows administrators to specify fine-grained content moderation policies and modify the weights of a text-to-image (TTI) model to make it significantly more challenging for users to produce images that violate the policies. In contrast to existing general-purpose model editing techniques, which unlearn concepts without considering the associated contexts, Moderator allows admins to specify what content should be moderated, under which context, how it should be moderated, and why moderation is necessary. Given a set of policies, Moderator first prompts the original model to generate images that need to be moderated, then uses these self-generated images to reverse fine-tune the model to compute task vectors for moderation and finally negates the original model with the task vectors to decrease its performance in generating moderated content. We evaluated Moderator with 14 participants to play the role of admins and found they could quickly learn and author policies to pass unit tests in approximately 2.29 policy iterations. Our experiment with 32 stable diffusion users suggested that Moderator can prevent 65% of users from generating moderated content under 15 attempts and require the remaining users an average of 8.3 times more attempts to generate undesired content.",

        "abstract": "In modern mobile devices, baseband is an integral component running on top of cellular processors to handle crucial radio communications. However, recent research reveals significant vulnerabilities in these basebands, posing serious security risks like remote code execution. Yet, effectively scrutinizing basebands remains a daunting task, as they run closed-source and proprietary software on vendor-specific chipsets. Existing analysis methods are limited by their dependence on manual processes and heuristic approaches, reducing their scalability. This paper introduces a novel approach to unveil security issues in basebands from a unique perspective: to uncover vendor-specific baseband commands from the Radio Interface Layer (RIL), a hardware abstraction layer interfacing with basebands. To demonstrate this concept, we have designed and developed BaseMirror, a static binary analysis tool to automatically reverse engineer baseband commands from vendor-specific RIL binaries. It utilizes a bidirectional taint analysis algorithm to adeptly identify baseband commands from an enhanced control flow graph enriched with reconstructed virtual function calls. Our methodology has been applied to 28 vendor RIL libraries, encompassing a wide range of Samsung Exynos smartphone models on the market. Remarkably, BaseMirror has uncovered 873 unique baseband commands undisclosed to the public. Based on these results, we develop an automated attack discovery framework to successfully derive and validate 8 zero-day vulnerabilities that trigger denial of cellular service and arbitrary file access on a Samsung Galaxy A53 device. These findings have been reported and confirmed by Samsung and a bug bounty was awarded to us.",

        "abstract": "Memory coloring is a software-based technique to ensure microar-chitectural isolation between trust domains sharing a CPU. Prior coloring schemes target individual microarchitectural components and thus provide only partial solutions. In this paper, we provide theoretical foundations and practical algorithms to infer comprehensive coloring schemes for modern cloud CPUs. To this end, we first formulate the requirements for effective memory coloring schemes in a set-theoretic model, including definitions for simultaneous isolation of shared components and uniform utilization of private components. We then algebraically characterize these requirements for microarchitectural components that are indexed by linear functions, which is the prevalent case in today\u2019s CPUs. Based on this, we develop efficient algorithms for computing multi-resource coloring schemes from linear indexing functions, and for reverse-engineering unknown linear indexing functions under minimal assumptions. In a case study, we use our algorithms to compute coloring schemes for recent Intel CPUs, and we show how to design indexing functions that maximize the number of supported trust domains.",

        "abstract": "Text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), undergo iterative updates to improve image quality and address concerns such as safety. Improvements in image quality are straightforward to assess. However, how model updates resolve existing concerns and whether they raise new questions remain unexplored. This study takes an initial step in investigating the evolution of text-to-image models from the perspectives of safety, bias, and authenticity. Our findings, centered on Stable Diffusion, indicate that model updates paint a mixed picture. While updates progressively reduce the generation of unsafe images, the bias issue, particularly in gender, intensifies. We also find that negative stereotypes either persist within the same Non-White race group or shift towards other Non-White race groups through SD updates, yet with minimal association of these traits with the White race group. Additionally, our evaluation reveals a new concern stemming from SD updates: State-of-the-art fake image detectors, initially trained for earlier SD versions, struggle to identify fake images generated by updated versions. We show that fine-tuning these detectors on fake images generated by updated versions achieves at least 96.6\\% accuracy across various SD versions, addressing this issue. Our insights highlight the importance of continued efforts to mitigate biases and vulnerabilities in evolving text-to-image models.",

        "abstract": "Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks introduces concerns about computational efficiency, prompting an exploration of efficient methods such as In-Context Learning (ICL). However, the vulnerability of ICL to privacy attacks under realistic assumptions remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first membership inference attack tailored for ICL, relying solely on generated texts without their associated probabilities. We propose four attack strategies tailored to various constrained scenarios and conduct extensive experiments on four popular large language models. Empirical results show that our attacks can accurately determine membership status in most cases, e.g., 95\\% accuracy advantage against LLaMA, indicating that the associated risks are much higher than those shown by existing probability-based attacks. Additionally, we propose a hybrid attack that synthesizes the strengths of the aforementioned strategies, achieving an accuracy advantage of over 95\\% in most cases. Furthermore, we investigate three potential defenses targeting data, instruction, and output. Results demonstrate combining defenses from orthogonal dimensions significantly reduces privacy leakage and offers enhanced privacy assurances.",

        "title": "Dye4AI: Assuring Data Boundary on Generative AI Services",
        "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is versatile for various applications, but security and privacy concerns with third-party AI vendors hinder its broader adoption in sensitive scenarios. Hence, it is essential for users to validate the AI trustworthiness and ensure the security of data boundaries. In this paper, we present a dye testing system named Dye4AI, which injects crafted trigger data into human-AI dialogue and observes AI responses towards specific prompts to diagnose data flow in AI model evolution. Our dye testing procedure contains 3 stages: trigger generation, trigger insertion, and trigger retrieval. First, to retain both uniqueness and stealthiness, we design a new trigger that transforms a pseudo-random number to a intelligible format. Second, with a custom-designed three-step conversation strategy, we insert each trigger item into dialogue and confirm the model memorizes the new trigger knowledge in the current session. Finally, we routinely try to recover triggers with specific prompts in new sessions, as triggers can present in new sessions only if AI vendors leverage user data for model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on six LLMs demonstrate our dye testing scheme is effective in ensuring the data boundary, even for models with various architectures and parameter sizes. Also, larger and premier models tend to be more suitable for Dye4AI, e.g., trigger can be retrieved in OpenLLaMa-13B even with only 2 insertions per trigger item. Moreover, we analyze the prompt selection in dye testing, providing insights for future testing systems on generative AI services.",

        "abstract": "Self-supervised learning shows promise in harnessing extensive unlabeled data, but it also confronts significant privacy concerns, especially in vision. In this paper, we aim to perform membership inference on visual self-supervised models in a more realistic setting: self-supervised training method and details are unknown for an adversary when attacking as he usually faces a black-box system in practice. In this setting, considering that self-supervised model could be trained by completely different self-supervised paradigms, e.g., masked image modeling and contrastive learning, with complex training details, we propose a unified membership inference method called PartCrop. It is motivated by the shared part-aware capability among models and stronger part response on the training data. Specifically, PartCrop crops parts of objects in an image to query responses with the image in representation space. We conduct extensive attacks on self-supervised models with different training protocols and structures using three widely used image datasets. The results verify the effectiveness and generalization of PartCrop. Moreover, to defend against PartCrop, we evaluate two common approaches, i.e., early stop and differential privacy, and propose a tailored method called shrinking crop scale range. The defense experiments indicate that all of them are effective. Our code is available at https://github.com/JiePKU/PartCrop.",

        "abstract": "Embedded software is used in safety-critical systems such as medical devices and autonomous vehicles, where software defects, including security vulnerabilities, have severe consequences. Most embedded codebases are developed in unsafe languages, specifically C/C++, and are riddled with memory safety vulnerabilities. To prevent such vulnerabilities, Rust, a performant memory-safe systems language, provides an optimal choice for developing embedded software. Rust interoperability enables developing Rust applications on top of existing C codebases. Despite this, even the most resourceful organizations continue to develop embedded software in C/C++. Thispaper performs the first systematic study to holistically understand the current state and challenges of using Rust for embedded systems. Our study is organized across three research questions. We collected a dataset of 6,408 Rust embedded software spanning various categories and 6 Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools. We performed a systematic analysis of our dataset and surveys with 225 developers to investigate our research questions. We found that existing Rust software support is inadequate, SAST tools cannot handle certain features of Rust embedded software, resulting in failures, and the prevalence of advanced types in existing Rust software makes it challenging to engineer interoperable code. In addition, we found various challenges faced by developers in using Rust for embedded systems development.",

        "title": "Crystalor: Recoverable Memory Encryption Mechanism with Optimized Metadata Structure",
        "abstract": "This study presents an efficient recoverable memory encryption mechanism, named Crystalor. Existing memory encryption mechanisms, such as Intel SGX integrity tree, offer neither crash consistency nor recoverability, which results in attack surfaces and causes a non-trivial limitation of practical availability. Although the crash consistency of encrypted memory has been studied in the research field of microarchitecture, existing mechanisms lack formal security analysis and cannot incorporate with metadata optimization mechanisms, which are essential to achieve a practical performance. Crystalor efficiently realizes provably-secure recoverable memory encryption with metadata optimization. To establish Crystalor with provable security and practical performance, we develop a dedicated universal hash function PXOR-Hash and a microarchitecture equipped with PXOR-Hash. Crystalor incurs almost no latency overhead under the nominal operations for the recoverability, while it has a simple construction in such a way as to be compatible with existing microarchitectures. We evaluate its practical performance through both algorithmic analyses and system-level simulation in comparison with the state-of-the-art ones, such as SCUE. Crystalor requires 29\u201362% fewer clock cycles per memory read/write operation than SCUE for protecting a 4TB memory. In addition, Crystalor and SCUE require 312GB and 554GB memory overheads for metadata, respectively, which indicates that Crystalor achieves a memory overhead reduction of 44%. The results of the system-level simulation using the gem5 simulator indicate that Crystalor achieves a reduction of up to 11.5% in the workload execution time compared to SCUE. Moreover, Crys-talor achieves a higher availability and memory recovery several thousand times faster than SCUE, as Crystalor offers lazy recovery .",

        "title": "Understanding Cross-Platform Referral Traffic for Illicit Drug Promotion",
        "abstract": "The promotion of illegal drugs has become increasingly prevalent on popular social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. Within this ecosystem, miscreants utilize cross-platform referral traffic to advertise and promote illicit drugs. They start by posting illicit drug-promoting comments on upstream social media platforms, attracting potential drug buyers, and then redi-recting these buyers to downstream platforms where the actual drug sales take place. To the best of our knowledge, little has been done so far to understand this cross-platform referral traffic for illicit drug promotion and selling on social media platforms, not to mention any effort to systematically identify such referral traffic on social media platforms. In this paper, we designed an automated pipeline for detecting illicit referral traffic and identified 154,753 drug-referral comments and 3,253 drug sellers. Based upon the dataset, we presented the first systematic study on the ecosystem of such cross-platform illicit drug promotion and selling businesses, which sheds light on the strategies and campaigns of illicit drug promotion. These findings provide valuable insights into the broader impact of illicit drug trading activities and highlight the need for increased attention to addressing the associated security concerns in social media platforms.",

        "abstract": "Query-based systems (QBSs) are one of the key approaches for sharing data. QBSs allow analysts to request aggregate information from a private protected dataset. Attacks are a crucial part of ensuring QBSs are truly privacy-preserving. The development and testing of attacks is however very labor-intensive and unable to cope with the increasing complexity of systems. Automated approaches have been shown to be promising but are currently extremely computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in practice. We here propose QueryCheetah, a fast and effective method for automated discovery of privacy attacks against QBSs. We instantiate QueryCheetah on attribute inference attacks and show it to discover stronger attacks than previous methods while being 18 times faster than the state-of-the-art automated approach. We then show how QueryCheetah allows system developers to thoroughly evaluate the privacy risk, including for various attacker strengths and target individuals. We finally show how QueryCheetah can be used out-of-the-box to find attacks in larger syntaxes and workarounds around ad-hoc defenses.",

        "title": "Conan: Distributed Proofs of Compliance for Anonymous Data Collection",
        "abstract": "We consider how to design an anonymous data collection protocol that enforces compliance rules. Imagine that each client contributes multiple data items (e.g., votes, location crumbs, or secret shares of its input) to an anonymous network, which mixes all clients\u2019 data items so that the receiver cannot determine which data items belong to the same user. Now, each user must prove to an auditor that the set it contributed satis\ufb01es a compliance predicate, without identifying which items it contributed. For example, the auditor may want to ensure that no voter voted for the same candidate twice, or that a user\u2019s location crumbs are not too far apart in a given time interval. Our main contribution is a novel anonymous, compliant data collection protocol that realizes the above goal. In comparison with na\u00a8\u0131ve approaches such as generic multi-party computation or earlier constructions of collaborative zero-knowledge proofs, the most compelling advantage of our approach is that each client\u2019s communication and computation overhead do not grow with respect to the number of clients n . In this sense, we save a factor of at least n over prior work, which allows our technique to scale to applications with a large number of clients, such as anonymous voting and privacy-preserving federated learning. We \ufb01rst describe our protocol using generic cryptographic primitives that can be realized from standard assumptions. We then suggest a concrete instantiation called Conan which we implement and evaluate. In this concrete instantiation, we are willing to employ SNARKs and the random oracle model for better practical e\ufb03ciency. Notably, in this practical instantiation, each client\u2019s additional communication overhead (not counting the overhead of sending its data items over the anonymous network) is only (cid:101) O (1). We evaluated our technique in various application settings, including secure voting, and secure aggregation protocols for histogram, summation, and vector summation. Our evaluation results show that in all scenarios, each client\u2019s additional communication overhead is only 2.2KB or 2.6KB, depending on which SNARK implementation we use. Further, each client\u2019s computation only 0.2s - 0.5s for almost all cases, except for the vector summation application where the data items are high-dimensional and each client\u2019s computation is 8.5-10.6s.",

        "abstract": "Watermarking is broadly utilized to protect ownership of shared data while preserving data utility. However, existing watermarking methods for tabular datasets fall short on the desired properties (detectability, non-intrusiveness, and robustness) and only preserve data utility from the perspective of data statistics, ignoring the performance of downstream ML models trained on the datasets. Can we watermark tabular datasets without significantly compromising their utility for training ML models while preventing attackers from training usable ML models on attacked datasets? In this paper, we propose a hypothesis testing-based watermarking scheme, TabularMark. Data noise partitioning is utilized for data perturbation during embedding, which is adaptable for numerical and categorical attributes while preserving the data utility. For detection, a custom-threshold one proportion z-test is employed, which can reliably determine the presence of the watermark. Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of TabularMark in detectability, non-intrusiveness, and robustness.",

        "title": "Training Robust ML-based Raw-Binary Malware Detectors in Hours, not Months",
        "abstract": "Machine-learning (ML) classifiers are increasingly used to distinguish malware from benign binaries. Recent work has shown that ML-based detectors can be evaded by adversarial examples, but also that one may defend against such attacks via adversarial training. However, adversarial training, and subsequent robustness evaluation, is computationally expensive in the raw-binary malware-detection domain because it requires producing many adversarial examples for both training and evaluation . Prior work found that Greedy-training , a faster robust training technique that forgoes using adversarial examples, showed some promise in producing robust malware detectors. However, Greedy -training was far less effective in inducing robustness than the more expensive adversarial training, and it also severely hurt natural accuracy (i.e., accuracy on the original data). To faster train models, this work presents GreedyBlock -training, an enhanced version of Greedy -training that we empirically show achieves not only state-of-the-art robustness in malware detectors, exceeding even adversarial training, but also retains natural accuracy better than adversarial training. Furthermore, as it does not require creating adversarial (or functional) examples, GreedyBlock -training is significantly faster than adversarial training. Specifically, we show that GreedyBlock -training can produce more robust (+54% on average), more naturally accurate (+7% on average), and more efficiently trained (-91% average computation) malware detectors than prior work. To faster evaluate models, we also develop methods to faster gauge the robustness of ML-based raw-binary malware detectors by introducing robustness proxies , which can be used either to predict which models are likely to be the most robust, thus helping prioritize which detectors to evaluate with expensive attacks, or aiding in deciding which detectors are worthwhile to continue training. Experimentally, we show these proxy measures can find the most robust detector in a pool of detectors while using only \u223c 20-50% of the computation that would otherwise be required.",

        "abstract": "Local differential privacy (LDP) provides a way for an untrusted data collector to aggregate users' data without violating their privacy. Various privacy-preserving data analysis tasks have been studied under the protection of LDP, such as frequency estimation, frequent itemset mining, and machine learning. Despite its privacy-preserving properties, recent research has demonstrated the vulnerability of certain LDP protocols to data poisoning attacks. However, existing data poisoning attacks are focused on basic statistics under LDP, such as frequency estimation and mean/variance estimation. As an important data analysis task, the security of LDP frequent itemset mining has yet to be thoroughly examined. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by presenting novel and practical data poisoning attacks against LDP frequent itemset mining protocols. By introducing a unified attack framework with composable attack operations, our data poisoning attack can successfully manipulate the state-of-the-art LDP frequent itemset mining protocols and has the potential to be adapted to other protocols with similar structures. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets to compare the proposed attack with four baseline attacks. The results demonstrate the severity of the threat and the effectiveness of the proposed attack.",

        "abstract": "Privacy label disclosure guideline, which specifies the data usage practices of third-party libraries (TPL), is a valuable resource for iOS app developers to accurately complete their iOS privacy labels. This is particularly important given the mandatory requirement for all apps on the App Store to disclose their data practices via privacy labels. However, it is essential to ensure the accuracy and compliance of these guidelines to ensure that accurate TPL data usage has been provided to app developers. Despite the significance of these guidelines, there is little understanding of how accurate and compliant they are in reflecting the actual data practices of third-party libraries used in iOS apps. To address this issue, our study implements a tool called Colaine to automatically check the compliance of privacy label disclosure guidelines, taking into account the configurable data practices in TPLs. Colaine analyzed 107 TPLs associated with 1,605 different configurations, shedding light on the prevalence and seriousness of privacy label disclosure guideline non-compliance issues.",

        "title": "Understanding Routing-Induced Censorship Changes Globally",
        "abstract": "Internet censorship is pervasive, with significant effort dedicated to understanding what is censored, and where. Prior censorship work however have identified significant inconsistencies in their results; experiments show unexplained non-determinism thought to be caused by censor load, end-host geographic diversity, or incomplete censorship -- inconsistencies which impede reliable, repeatable and correct understanding of global censorship. In this work we investigate the extent to which Equal-cost Multi-path (ECMP) routing is the cause for these inconsistencies, developing methods to measure and compensate for them. We find ECMP routing significantly changes observed censorship across protocols, censor mechanisms, and in 17 countries. We identify that previously observed non-determinism or regional variations are attributable to measurements between fixed end-hosts taking different routes based on Flow-ID; i.e., choice of intra-subnet source IP or ephemeral source port leads to differences in observed censorship. To achieve this we develop new route-stable censorship measurement methods that allow consistent measurement of DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS censorship. We find ECMP routing yields censorship changes across 42% of IPs and 51% of ASes, but that impact is not uniform. We identify numerous causes of the behavior, ranging from likely failed infrastructure, to routes to the same end-host taking geographically diverse paths which experience differences in censorship en-route. Finally, we explore our results in the context of prior global measurement studies, exploring first the applicability of our findings to prior observed variations, and then demonstrating how specific experiments from two studies could be impacted by, and specific results are explainable by, ECMP routing. Our work points to methods for improving future studies, reducing inconsistencies and increasing repeatability.",

        "title": "fAmulet: Finding Finalization Failure Bugs in Polygon zkRollup",
        "abstract": "Zero-knowledge layer 2 protocols emerge as a compelling approach to overcoming blockchain scalability issues by processing transactions through the transaction finalization process. During this process, transactions are efficiently processed off the main chain. Besides, both the transaction data and the zero-knowledge proofs of transaction executions are reserved on the main chain, ensuring the availability of transaction data as well as the correctness and verifiability of transaction executions. Hence, any bugs that cause the transaction finalization failure are crucial, as they impair the usability of these protocols and the scalability of blockchains. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study on finalization failure bugs in zero-knowledge layer 2 protocols, and define two kinds of such bugs. Besides, we design fAmulet, the first tool to detect finalization failure bugs in Polygon zkRollup, a prominent zero-knowledge layer 2 protocol, by leveraging fuzzing testing. To trigger finalization failure bugs effectively, we introduce a finalization behavior model to guide our transaction fuzzer to generate and mutate transactions for inducing diverse behaviors across each component (e.g., Sequencer) in the finalization process. Moreover, we define bug oracles according to the distinct bug definitions to accurately detect bugs. Through our evaluation, fAmulet can uncover twelve zero-day finalization failure bugs in Polygon zkRollup, and cover at least 20.8% more branches than baselines. Furthermore, through our preliminary study, fAmulet uncovers a zero-day finalization failure bug in Scroll zkRollup, highlighting the generality of fAmulet to be applied to other zero-knowledge layer 2 protocols. At the time of writing, all our uncovered bugs have been confirmed and fixed by Polygon zkRollup and Scroll zkRollup teams.",

        "abstract": "Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) protocols are known to be difficult to design and to reason about. To address this challenge, on one hand, several approaches have been developed recently for computer-aided formal verification of the desired correctness properties, both safety and liveness, of standalone BFT protocols. On the other hand, the distributed computing community has made attempts to reduce the conceptual complexity of constructing new such protocols by showing how to assemble them from simpler \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d. No methodology to date combines these two approaches for foundational verification of arbitrary BFT protocols. We present Bythos, the first foundational framework for compositional mechanised verification of both safety and liveness of composite BFT protocols. Bythos is implemented on top of the Coq proof assistant and uses Coq\u2019s higher-order logic to reuse proofs of common facts about knowledge and trust in BFT protocols. It allows for compact liveness specifications in the style of TLA+, and for their proofs using an embedding of TLA into Coq. Most importantly, Bythos provides a family of higher-order definitions that allow building composite BFT protocols from simpler ones, with their correctness proofs derived. We showcase Bythos by verifying in it safety and liveness properties of three basic BFT protocols: Reliable Broadcast, Provable Broadcast, and the recently proposed Accountable Byzantine Confirmer, as well as their compositions.",

        "title": "Isolate and Detect the Untrusted Driver with a Virtual Box",
        "abstract": "In kernel, the driver code is much more than the core code, thus having a larger attack surface. Especially for the untrusted drivers without source code, they may come from the hot-plug hardware or the user without security knowledge. Traditional isolation methods require analyzing source code to set checkpoints in the driver for control flow protection, which are not available for closed-source drivers. Even worse, the existing isolation methods can only prevent the hijacked control flows entering/existing drivers, while they cannot discover the illegal control flows inside drivers. Although the kernel address space location randomization (KASLR) can defend against control flow hijacking, it can be bypassed by code probes. In response to these issues, this paper proposes a novel method Dbox to isolate and detect the untrusted drivers whose source code is unavailable. Dbox creates a light hypervisor to monitor and analyze the untrusted driver\u2019s behavior without relying on source code. It isolates the untrusted driver in a private space and dynamically changes its virtual space through a sliding space mechanism. Under the protection of Dbox, all control flows jumping to/from untrusted drivers can be detected. Experiments and analysis show that Dbox has good protection against code probes, kernel rootkits and code reuse attacks, and the overhead introduced to the operating system is less than 3.6% in general scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Mutation-based fuzzing effectively discovers defects in JS engines. High-quality mutations are key for the performance of mutation-based fuzzers. The choice of the underlying representation (e.g., a sequence of tokens, an abstract syntax tree, or an intermediate representation) defines the possible mutation space and subsequently influences the design of mutation operators. Current program representations in JS engine fuzzers center around abstract syntax trees and customized bytecode-level intermediate languages. However, existing efforts struggle to generate semantically valid and meaningful mutations, limiting the discovery of defects in JS engines. Our proposed graph-based intermediate representation, FlowIR, directly represents the JS control flow and data flow as the mutation target. FlowIR is essential for the implementation of powerful semantic mutation. It supports mutation operators at the data flow and control flow level, thereby expanding the granularity of mutation operators. Experimental results show that our method is more effective in discovering new bugs. Our prototype, FuzzFlow, outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in generating valid test cases and exploring code coverage. In our evaluation, we detected 37 new defects in thoroughly tested mainstream JS engines.",

        "title": "Camel: Communication-Efficient and Maliciously Secure Federated Learning in the Shuffle Model of Differential Privacy",
        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has rapidly become a compelling paradigm that enables multiple clients to jointly train a model by sharing only gradient updates for aggregation, without revealing their local private data. In order to protect the gradient updates which could also be privacy-sensitive, there has been a line of work studying local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms to provide a formal privacy guarantee. With LDP mechanisms, clients locally perturb their gradient updates before sharing them out for aggregation. However, such approaches are known for greatly degrading the model utility, due to heavy noise addition. To enable a better privacy-utility tradeoff, a recently emerging trend is to apply the shuffle model of DP in FL, which relies on an intermediate shuffling operation on the perturbed gradient updates to achieve privacy amplification. Following this trend, in this paper, we present Camel, a new communication-efficient and maliciously secure FL framework in the shuffle model of DP. Camel first departs from existing works by ambitiously supporting integrity check for the shuffle computation, achieving security against malicious adversary. Specifically, Camel builds on the trending cryptographic primitive of secret-shared shuffle, with custom techniques we develop for optimizing system-wide communication efficiency, and for lightweight integrity checks to harden the security of server-side computation. In addition, we also derive a significantly tighter bound on the privacy loss through analyzing the Renyi differential privacy (RDP) of the overall FL process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Camel achieves better privacy-utility trade-offs than the state-of-the-art work, with promising performance.",

        "abstract": "Recent works in amortized sublinear Private Information Retrieval (PIR) have demonstrated great potential. Despite the inspiring progress, existing schemes in this new paradigm are still faced with various challenges and bottlenecks, including large client storage, high communication, poor practical efficiency, need for non-colluding servers, or restricted client query sequences. We present simple and practical amortized sublinear stateful private information retrieval schemes without these drawbacks using new techniques in hint construction and usage. In particular, we introduce a dummy set to the client\u2019s request to eliminate any leakage or correctness failures. Our techniques can work with two non-colluding servers or a single server. The resulting PIR schemes achieve practical efficiency. The online response overhead is only twice that of simply fetching the desired entry without privacy. For a database with 2 28 entries of 32-byte, each query of our two-server scheme consumes 34 KB of communication and 2.7 milliseconds of computation, and each query of our single-server scheme consumes amortized 47 KB of communication and 4.5 milliseconds of computation. These results are one or more orders of magnitude better than prior works.",

        "abstract": "Suppose each user $i$ holds a private value $x_i$ in some metric space $(U, \\mathrm{dist})$, and an untrusted data analyst wishes to compute $\\sum_i f(x_i)$ for some function $f : U \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ by asking each user to send in a privatized $f(x_i)$. This is a fundamental problem in privacy-preserving population analytics, and the local model of differential privacy (LDP) is the predominant model under which the problem has been studied. However, LDP requires any two different $x_i, x'_i$ to be $\\varepsilon$-distinguishable, which can be overly strong for geometric/numerical data. On the other hand, Geo-Privacy (GP) stipulates that the level of distinguishability be proportional to $\\mathrm{dist}(x_i, x_i')$, providing an attractive alternative notion of personal data privacy in a metric space. However, existing GP mechanisms for this problem, which add a uniform noise to either $x_i$ or $f(x_i)$, are not satisfactory. In this paper, we generalize the smooth sensitivity framework from Differential Privacy to Geo-Privacy, which allows us to add noise tailored to the hardness of the given instance. We provide definitions, mechanisms, and a generic procedure for computing the smooth sensitivity under GP equipped with a general metric. Then we present three applications: one-way and two-way threshold functions, and Gaussian kernel density estimation, to demonstrate the applicability and utility of our smooth sensitivity framework.",

        "title": "Byzantine-Robust Decentralized Federated Learning",
        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train machine learning models without revealing their private training data. In conventional FL, the system follows the server-assisted architecture (server-assisted FL), where the training process is coordinated by a central server. However, the server-assisted FL framework suffers from poor scalability due to a communication bottleneck at the server, and trust dependency issues. To address challenges, decentralized federated learning (DFL) architecture has been proposed to allow clients to train models collaboratively in a serverless and peer-to-peer manner. However, due to its fully decentralized nature, DFL is highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where malicious clients could manipulate the system by sending carefully-crafted local models to their neighboring clients. To date, only a limited number of Byzantine-robust DFL methods have been proposed, most of which are either communication-inefficient or remain vulnerable to advanced poisoning attacks. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called BALANCE (Byzantine-robust averaging through local similarity in decentralization) to defend against poisoning attacks in DFL. In BALANCE, each client leverages its own local model as a similarity reference to determine if the received model is malicious or benign. We establish the theoretical convergence guarantee for BALANCE under poisoning attacks in both strongly convex and non-convex settings. Furthermore, the convergence rate of BALANCE under poisoning attacks matches those of the state-of-the-art counterparts in Byzantine-free settings. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that BALANCE outperforms existing DFL methods and effectively defends against poisoning attacks.",

        "abstract": "Audio deepfakes represent a rising threat to trust in our daily communications. In response to this, the research community has developed a wide array of detection techniques aimed at preventing such attacks from deceiving users. Unfortunately, the creation of these defenses has generally overlooked the most important element of the system - the user themselves. As such, it is not clear whether current mechanisms augment, hinder, or simply contradict human classification of deepfakes. In this paper, we perform the first large-scale user study on deepfake detection. We recruit over 1,200 users and present them with samples from the three most widely-cited deepfake datasets. We then quantitatively compare performance and qualitatively conduct thematic analysis to motivate and understand the reasoning behind user decisions and differences from machine classifications. Our results show that users correctly classify human audio at significantly higher rates than machine learning models, and rely on linguistic features and intuition when performing classification. However, users are also regularly mis-led by pre-conceptions about the capabilities of generated audio (e.g",

        "abstract": "In the pursuit of an effective spam detection system, the focus has often been on identifying known spam patterns either through rule-based detection systems or machine learning (ML) solutions that rely on keywords. However, both systems are susceptible to evasion techniques and zero-day attacks that can be achieved at low cost. Therefore, an email that bypassed the defense system once can do it again in the following days, even though rules are updated or the ML models are retrained. The recurrence of failures to detect emails that exhibit layout similarities to previously undetected spam is concerning for customers and can erode their trust in a company. Our observations show that threat actors reuse email kits extensively and can bypass detection with little effort, for example, by making changes to the content of emails. In this work, we propose an email visual similarity detection approach, named Pisco, to improve the detection capabilities of an email threat defense system. We apply our proof of concept to some real-world samples received from different sources. Our results show that email kits are being reused extensively and visually similar emails are sent to our customers at various time intervals. Therefore, this method could be very helpful in situations where detection engines that rely on textual features and keywords are bypassed, an occurrence our observations show happens frequently.",

        "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) apps can harvest a wider range of user data than web/mobile apps running on personal computers or smartphones. Existing law and privacy regulations emphasize that VR developers should inform users of what data are collected/used/shared (CUS) through privacy policies. However, privacy policies in the VR ecosystem are still in their early stages, and many developers fail to write appropriate privacy policies that comply with regulations and meet user expectations. In this paper, we propose VPVet to automatically vet privacy policy compliance issues for VR apps. VPVet first analyzes the availability and completeness of a VR privacy policy and then refines its analysis based on three key criteria: granularity, minimization, and consistency of CUS statements. Our study establishes the first and currently largest VR privacy policy dataset named VRPP, consisting of privacy policies of 11,923 different VR apps from 10 mainstream platforms. Our vetting results reveal severe privacy issues within the VR ecosystem, including the limited availability and poor quality of privacy policies, along with their coarse granularity, lack of adaptation to VR traits and the inconsistency between CUS statements in privacy policies and their actual behaviors. We open-source VPVet system along with our findings at repository https://github.com/kalamoo/PPAudit, aiming to raise awareness within the VR community and pave the way for further research in this field.",

        "title": "Actively Secure Private Set Intersection in the Client-Server Setting",
        "abstract": "Private set intersection (PSI) allows two parties to compute the intersection of their sets without revealing anything else. In some applications of PSI, a server holds a large set and runs a PSI protocol with multiple clients, each with its own smaller set. In this setting, existing protocols fall short: they either achieve only semi-honest security, or else require the server to run the protocol from scratch for each execution. We design an efficient protocol for this setting with simulation-based security against malicious adversaries. In our protocol, the server publishes a one-time, linear-size encoding of its set. Then, multiple clients can independently execute a PSI protocol with the server, with complexity linear in the size of each client\u2019s set. To learn the intersection, a client can download the server\u2019s encoding, which can be accelerated via content-distribution or peer-to-peer networks since the same encoding is used by all clients; alternatively, clients can fetch only the relevant parts of the encoding using verifiable private information retrieval. A key ingredient of our protocol is an efficient instantiation of an oblivious verifiable unpredictable function, which may be of independent interest. Our implementation shows that our protocol is highly efficient. For a server holding 10 8 elements and each client holding 10 3 elements, the size of the server\u2019s encoding is 800MB; an execution of the protocol uses 60MB of communication, runs in under 5s in a WAN network with 120 Mbps bandwidth, and costs only 0.017 USD when utilizing network-caching infrastructures, a 5 \u00d7 saving compared to a state-of-the-art PSI protocol.",

        "abstract": "UWB ranging systems have been adopted in many critical and security sensitive applications due to its precise positioning and secure ranging capabilities. We present a practical jamming attack, namely UWBAD, against commercial UWB ranging systems, which exploits the vulnerability of the adoption of the normalized cross-correlation process in UWB ranging and can selectively and quickly block ranging sessions without prior knowledge of the configurations of the victim devices, potentially leading to severe consequences such as property loss, unauthorized access, or vehicle theft. UWBAD achieves more effective and less imperceptible jamming due to: (i) it efficiently blocks every ranging session by leveraging the field-level jamming, thereby exerting a tangible impact on commercial UWB ranging systems, and (ii) the compact, reactive, and selective system design based on COTS UWB chips, making it affordable and less imperceptible. We successfully conducted real attacks against commercial UWB ranging systems from the three largest UWB chip vendors on the market, e.g., Apple, NXP, and Qorvo. We reported our findings to Apple, related Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), and the Automotive Security Research Group, triggering internal security incident response procedures at Volkswagen, Audi, Bosch, and NXP. As of the writing of this paper, the related OEM has acknowledged this vulnerability in their automotive systems and has offered a $5,000 reward as a bounty.",

        "abstract": "Intent-based networking (IBN) enables network administrators to express high-level goals and network policies without needing to specify low-level forwarding configurations, topologies, or protocols. Administrators can define intents that capture the overall behavior they want from the network, and an IBN controller compiles such intents into low-level configurations that get installed in the network and implement the desired behavior. We discovered that current IBN specifications and implementations do not specify that flow rule installation orderings should be enforced, which leads to temporal vulnerabilities where, for a limited time, attackers can exploit indeterminate connectivity behavior to gain unauthorized network access. In this paper, we analyze the causes of such temporal vulnerabilities and their security impacts with a representative case study via the ONOS IBN implementation. We devise the Phantom Link attack and demonstrate a working exploit to highlight the security impacts. To defend against such attacks, we propose Spotlight , a detection method that can alert a system administrator of risky intent updates prone to exploitable temporal vulnerabilities. Spotlight is effective in identifying risky updates using realistic network topologies and policies. We show that Spotlight can detect risky updates in a mean time of 0.65 seconds for topologies of over 1,300 nodes.",

        "title": "SafeGen: Mitigating Sexually Explicit Content Generation in Text-to-Image Models",
        "abstract": "Text-to-image (T2I) models, such as Stable Diffusion, have exhibited remarkable performance in generating high-quality images from text descriptions in recent years. However, text-to-image models may be tricked into generating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, particularly in sexually explicit scenarios. Existing countermeasures mostly focus on filtering inappropriate inputs and outputs, or suppressing improper text embeddings, which can block sexually explicit content (e.g., naked) but may still be vulnerable to adversarial prompts -- inputs that appear innocent but are ill-intended. In this paper, we present SafeGen, a framework to mitigate sexual content generation by text-to-image models in a text-agnostic manner. The key idea is to eliminate explicit visual representations from the model regardless of the text input. In this way, the text-to-image model is resistant to adversarial prompts since such unsafe visual representations are obstructed from within. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets and large-scale user studies demonstrate SafeGen's effectiveness in mitigating sexually explicit content generation while preserving the high-fidelity of benign images. SafeGen outperforms eight state-of-the-art baseline methods and achieves 99.4% sexual content removal performance. Furthermore, our constructed benchmark of adversarial prompts provides a basis for future development and evaluation of anti-NSFW-generation methods.",

        "title": "Understanding Implosion in Text-to-Image Generative Models",
        "abstract": "Recent works show that text-to-image generative models are surprisingly vulnerable to a variety of poisoning attacks. Empirical results find that these models can be corrupted by altering associations between individual text prompts and associated visual features. Furthermore, a number of concurrent poisoning attacks can induce\"model implosion,\"where the model becomes unable to produce meaningful images for unpoisoned prompts. These intriguing findings highlight the absence of an intuitive framework to understand poisoning attacks on these models. In this work, we establish the first analytical framework on robustness of image generative models to poisoning attacks, by modeling and analyzing the behavior of the cross-attention mechanism in latent diffusion models. We model cross-attention training as an abstract problem of\"supervised graph alignment\"and formally quantify the impact of training data by the hardness of alignment, measured by an Alignment Difficulty (AD) metric. The higher the AD, the harder the alignment. We prove that AD increases with the number of individual prompts (or concepts) poisoned. As AD grows, the alignment task becomes increasingly difficult, yielding highly distorted outcomes that frequently map meaningful text prompts to undefined or meaningless visual representations. As a result, the generative model implodes and outputs random, incoherent images at large. We validate our analytical framework through extensive experiments, and we confirm and explain the unexpected (and unexplained) effect of model implosion while producing new, unforeseen insights. Our work provides a useful tool for studying poisoning attacks against diffusion models and their defenses.",

        "abstract": "Empirical defenses for machine learning privacy forgo the provable guarantees of differential privacy in the hope of achieving higher utility while resisting realistic adversaries. We identify severe pitfalls in existing empirical privacy evaluations (based on membership inference attacks) that result in misleading conclusions. In particular, we show that prior evaluations fail to characterize the privacy leakage of the most vulnerable samples, use weak attacks, and avoid comparisons with practical differential privacy baselines. In 5 case studies of empirical privacy defenses, we find that prior evaluations underestimate privacy leakage by an order of magnitude. Under our stronger evaluation, none of the empirical defenses we study are competitive with a properly tuned, high-utility DP-SGD baseline (with vacuous provable guarantees).",

        "title": "Is Difficulty Calibration All We Need? Towards More Practical Membership Inference Attacks",
        "abstract": "The vulnerability of machine learning models to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) has garnered considerable attention in recent years. These attacks determine whether a data sample belongs to the model's training set or not. Recent research has focused on reference-based attacks, which leverage difficulty calibration with independently trained reference models. While empirical studies have demonstrated its effectiveness, there is a notable gap in our understanding of the circumstances under which it succeeds or fails. In this paper, we take a further step towards a deeper understanding of the role of difficulty calibration. Our observations reveal inherent limitations in calibration methods, leading to the misclassification of non-members and suboptimal performance, particularly on high-loss samples. We further identify that these errors stem from an imperfect sampling of the potential distribution and a strong dependence of membership scores on the model parameters. By shedding light on these issues, we propose RAPID: a query-efficient and computation-efficient MIA that directly \\textbf{R}e-lever\\textbf{A}ges the original membershi\\textbf{P} scores to m\\textbf{I}tigate the errors in \\textbf{D}ifficulty calibration. Our experimental results, spanning 9 datasets and 5 model architectures, demonstrate that RAPID outperforms previous state-of-the-art attacks (e.g., LiRA and Canary offline) across different metrics while remaining computationally efficient. Our observations and analysis challenge the current de facto paradigm of difficulty calibration in high-precision inference, encouraging greater attention to the persistent risks posed by MIAs in more practical scenarios.",

To alleviate these costs, Intel introduced new hardware mechanisms to send inter-processor interrupts (IPIs) from user space without switching into the kernel and from virtual machines without switching into the hypervisor. However, it is unclear whether this direct, unsupervised interaction between unprivileged (or virtualized) workloads and the underlying hardware introduces a significant change in the attack surface. In this paper, we present the IPI side channel, a novel side-channel attack exploiting the recently introduced user interrupts and IPI virtualization features on Intel Sapphire Rapids and the upcoming Intel Arrow Lake processors. The IPI side channel is the first cross-core interrupt detection side channel, allowing an attacker to monitor interrupts delivered to any physical core of the same processor. Our attack is based on precise measurements of the hardware delivery time of interrupts from user space and virtual machines. More specifically, we exploit that interrupts are delivered through a cross-core bus, leading to timing variations on the attacker\u2019s local IPIs. We present multiple case studies to compare the IPI side channel with the state of the art: First, we present an unprivileged cross-core covert channel with a native true capacity of 434 . 7kbit/s ( \ud835\udc5b =100, \ud835\udf0e \u00af \ud835\udc65 =0.03) and a cross-VM capacity of 3 . 45kbit/s ( \ud835\udc5b =100, \ud835\udf0e \u00af \ud835\udc65 =0.01). Second, we demonstrate a native inter-keystroke timing attack with an \ud835\udc39 1 score of 97 . 9%. Third, we present an open-world website fingerprinting attack on the top 100 websites, achieving an \ud835\udc39 1 score of 89 . 0% in a native scenario and an \ud835\udc39 1 score of 71 . 0% in a cross-VM (thin client) scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the broader context of the IPI side channels and categorize interrupt side channels and mitigations.",

        "abstract": "The video game market is one of the biggest for software products. Video game development has progressed in the last decades to complex and multifaceted endeavors. Games-as-a-Service significantly impacted distribution and gameplay, requiring providers and developers to consider factors beyond game functionality, including security and privacy. New security challenges emerged, including authentication, payment security, and user data or asset protection. However, the security community lacks in-depth insights into the security experiences, challenges, and practices of modern video game development. This paper aims to address this gap in research and highlights the criticality of considering security in the process. Therefore, we conducted 20 qualitative, semi-structured inter-views with various roles of professional and skilled video game development experts, investigating awareness, priorities, knowledge, and practices regarding security in the industry through their first-hand experiences. We find that stakeholders are aware of the urgency of security and related issues. However, they often face obstacles, including a lack of money, time, and knowledge, which force them to put security issues lower in priority. We conclude our work by recommending how the game industry can incorporate security into its development processes while balancing other resources and priorities and illustrating ideas for future research.",

        "abstract": "There exists a verification gap between formal protocol specifications and their actual implementations, which this work aims to bridge via monitoring for compliance to the formal specification. We instrument the networking and cryptographic library the application uses to obtain a stream of events. This is possible even without source code access. We then use an efficient algorithm to match these observations to traces that are valid in the specification model. In contrast to prior work, our algorithm can handle non-determinism and thus, multiple sessions. It also achieves a low overhead, which we demonstrate on the WireGuard reference implementation and a case study from prior work. We find that the reference Tamarin model for WireGuard can be used with little change: We only need to specify wire formats and correct some small inaccuracies that we discovered while conducting the case study. We also provide a soundness result for our algorithm that ensures it accepts only event streams that are valid according to the specification model.",

        "title": "Byzantine-Secure Relying Party for Resilient RPKI",
        "abstract": "To protect against prefix hijacks, Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) has been standardized. To enjoy the security guarantees of RPKI validation, networks need to install a new component, the relying party validator, which fetches and validates RPKI objects and provides them to border routers. However, recent work shows that relying parties experience failures when retrieving RPKI objects and are vulnerable to attacks, all of which can disable RPKI validation. Therefore even the few adopters are not necessarily secure. We make the first proposal that significantly improves the resilience and security of RPKI. We develop BRP, a Byzantine-Secure relying party implementation. In BRP the relying party nodes redundantly validate RPKI objects and reach a global consensus through voting. BRP provides an RPKI equivalent of public DNS, removing the need for networks to install, operate, and upgrade their own relying party instances while avoiding the need to trust operators of BRP nodes. We show through simulations and experiments that BRP, as an intermediate RPKI service, results in less load on RPKI publication points and a robust output despite RPKI repository failures, jitter, and attacks. We engineer BRP to be fully backward compatible and readily deployable - it does not require any changes to the border routers and the RPKI repositories. We demonstrate that BRP can protect many networks transparently, with either a decentralized or centralized deployment. BRP can be set up as a network of decentralized volunteer deployments, similarly to NTP and TOR, where different operators participate in the peering process with their node, and provide resilient and secure relying party validation to the Internet. BRP can also be hosted by a single operator as a centralized service, e.g., on one cloud or CDN, and provides RPKI validation benefits even when hosted on a single network.",

        "abstract": "The escalating threat of hidden GPS tracking devices poses significant risks to personal privacy and security. Featured by their miniaturization and misleading appearances, GPS devices can be easily disguised in their surroundings making their detection extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel side-channel-driven detection system, GPSBuster , leveraging electromagnetic radiation (EMR) emitted by GPS trackers. Our feasibility studies and hardware analysis reveal that unique EMR patterns associated with the tracker\u2019s operation, stemming from the quartz oscillator, local oscillator, and mixer in the Mixed-Signal on Chip (MSoC) system. Never-theless, as a side-channel leakage, EMRs can be extremely weak and suffer from the ambient noise inference, rendering the detections impractical. To address these challenges, we develop the signal processing techniques with noise removals and a dual-dimensional folding mechanism to accumulate the spectrum energy and pro-trude the EMR patterns with high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR). Our detection prototype, built with a portable HackRF One device, allows users to perform a scan-to-detect manner and achieves an overall",

        "title": "AutoPatch: Automated Generation of Hotpatches for Real-Time Embedded Devices",
        "abstract": "Real-time embedded devices like medical or industrial devices are increasingly targeted by cyber-attacks. Prompt patching is crucial to mitigate the serious consequences of such attacks on these devices. Hotpatching is an approach to apply a patch to mission-critical embedded devices without rebooting them. However, existing hotpatching approaches require developers to manually write the hotpatch for target systems, which is time-consuming and error-prone. To address these issues, we propose AutoPatch, a new hotpatching technique that automatically generates functionally equivalent hotpatches via static analysis of the official patches. AutoPatch introduces a new software triggering approach that supports diverse embedded devices, and preserves the functionality of the official patch. In contrast to prior work, AutoPatch does not rely on hardware support for triggering patches, or on executing patches in specialized virtual machines. We implemented AutoPatch using the LLVM compiler, and evaluated its efficiency, effectiveness and generality using 62 real CVEs on four embedded devices with different specifications and architectures running popular RTOSes. We found that AutoPatch can fix more than 90% of CVEs, and resolve the vulnerability successfully. The results revealed an average total delay of less than 12.7 $\\mu s$ for fixing the vulnerabilities, representing a performance improvement of 50% over RapidPatch, a state-of-the-art approach. Further, our memory overhead, on average, was slightly lower than theirs (23%). Finally, AutoPatch was able to generate hotpatches for all four devices without any modifications.",

        "title": "Fast Two-party Threshold ECDSA with Proactive Security",
        "abstract": "We present a new construction of two-party, threshold ECDSA, building on a 2017 scheme of Lindell and improving his scheme in several ways. ECDSA signing is notoriously hard to distribute securely, due to non-linearities in the signing function. Lindell\u2019s scheme uses Paillier encryption to encrypt one party\u2019s key share and handle these non-linearities homomorphically, while elegantly avoiding any expensive zero knowledge proofs over the Paillier group during the signing process. However, the scheme pushes that complexity into key generation. Moreover, avoiding ZK proofs about Paillier ciphertexts during signing comes with a steep price \u2013 namely, the scheme requires a \u201cglobal abort\u201d when a malformed ciphertext is detected, after which an entirely new key must be generated. Weovercome all of these issues with a proactive Refresh procedure. Since the Paillier decryption key is part of the secret that must be proactively refreshed, our first improvement is to radically accelerate key generation by replacing one of Lindell\u2019s ZK proofs \u2013 which requires 80 Paillier ciphertexts for statistical security 2 \u2212 40 \u2013 with a much faster \u201cweak\u201d proof that requires only 2 Paillier ciphertexts, and which proves a weaker statement about a Paillier ciphertext that we show is sufficient in the context of our scheme. Secondly, our more efficient key generation procedure also makes frequent proactive Refreshes practical. Finally, we show that adding noise to one party\u2019s key share suffices to avoid the need to reset the public verification key when certain bad behavior is detected. Instead, we prove that our Refresh procedure, performed after each detection, suffices for addressing the attack, allowing the system to continue functioning without disruption to applications that rely on the verification key. Our scheme is also very efficient, competitive with the best constructions that do not provide proactive security, and state-of-the-art among the few results that do. Our optimizations to ECDSA key generation speed up runtime and improve bandwidth over Lindell\u2019s key generation by factors of 7 and 13, respectively. Our Key Generation protocol requires 20% less bandwidth than existing constructions, completes in only 3 protocol messages, and executes much faster than all but OT-based key generation. For ECDSA signing, our extra Refresh protocol does add a 10X latency and 5X bandwidth overhead compared to Lindell. However, this still fits in 150 ms runtime and about 5.4 KB of messages when run in our AWS cluster benchmark.",

        "abstract": "Browser extensions are third-party add-ons that provide myriads of features to their users while browsing on the Web. Extensions often interact with the websites a user visits and perform various operations such as DOM-based manipulation, script injections, and so on. However, this also enables nefarious websites to track their visitors by fingerprinting extensions. Researchers in the past have shown that extensions are susceptible to fingerprinting based on the resources they include, the styles they deploy, or the DOM-based modifications they perform. Fortunately, the current extension ecosystem contains safeguards against many such known issues through appropriate defense mechanisms. We present the first study to investigate the fingerprinting characteristics of extension-injected code in pages\u2019 JavaScript names-pace and through other observable side-effects like changed cookies. Doing so, we find that many extensions inject JavaScript that pol-lutes the applications\u2019 global namespace by registering variables. It also enables the attacker application to monitor the execution of the injected code by overwriting the JavaScript APIs and capturing execution traces through the stacktrace , the set of APIs invoked, etc. Further, extensions also store data on the client side and perform event-driven functionalities that aid in attribution. Through our tests, we find 2,747 Chrome and 572 Firefox extensions to be susceptible to fingerprinting. Unfortunately, none of the existing defense mechanisms prevent extensions from being fingerprinted through our proposed vectors. Therefore, we also suggest potential measures for developers and browser vendors to safeguard the extension ecosystem against such fingerprinting attempts.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in natural language tasks, but their outputs can exhibit undesirable attributes or biases. Existing methods for steering LLMs toward desired attributes often assume unbiased representations and rely solely on steering prompts. However, the representations learned from pre-training can introduce semantic biases that influence the steering process, leading to suboptimal results. We propose LLMGuardrail, a novel framework that incorporates causal analysis and adversarial learning to obtain unbiased steering representations in LLMs. LLMGuardrail systematically identifies and blocks the confounding effects of biases, enabling the extraction of unbiased steering representations. Additionally, it includes an explainable component that provides insights into the alignment between the generated output and the desired direction. Experiments demonstrate LLMGuardrail's effectiveness in steering LLMs toward desired attributes while mitigating biases. Our work contributes to the development of safe and reliable LLMs that align with desired attributes.",

        "title": "On Understanding and Forecasting Fuzzers Performance with Static Analysis",
        "abstract": "Fuzz testing, a technique for detecting critical software vulnerabilities, combines various methodologies from previous research to improve its effectiveness. For fuzzing practitioners, it is imperative to comprehend the effects of distinct techniques and select the ideal configuration customized to the program they need to test. However, evaluating the individual contributions of these techniques is often very difficult. Prior research compared assembled fuzzers and studied their affinity with different programs. Nevertheless, assembled fuzzers cannot be easily broken down into independent components, and therefore, the evaluation does not clarify which technique explains the performance of the fuzzer. Without understanding the potential impact of integrating different fuzzing techniques, it becomes even more challenging to adjust the fuzzer configuration for different programs under test. Our research tackles this challenge by introducing a novel approach that correlates static analysis features extracted at compile time with the performance results of various fuzzing techniques. Our method uses diverse metrics to uncover the relationship be-tween the static attributes of a program and the dynamic runtime performance of fuzzers. The correlation analysis performed on 23 target applications reveals interesting relationships, such as power schedulers performing better with larger programs and context-sensitive feedback struggling with a large number of inputs. This approach not only enhances our analytical understanding of fuzzing techniques, but also enables predictive capabilities. We show how a simple machine learning model can propose a fuzzer configuration customized for a particular program using information collected through static analysis. In 11 of our benchmark programs, fuzzers using the suggested configuration achieved the best improvement over the baseline compared to AFLplusplus, LibFuzzer and Honggfuzz.",

        "title": "The Harder You Try, The Harder You Fail: The KeyTrap Denial-of-Service Algorithmic Complexity Attacks on DNSSEC",
        "abstract": "Availability is a major concern in the design of DNSSEC. To ensure availability, DNSSEC follows Postel's Law [RFC1123]:\"Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.\"Hence, nameservers should send not just one matching key for a record set, but all the relevant cryptographic material, e.g., all the keys for all the ciphers that they support and all the corresponding signatures. This ensures that validation succeeds, and hence availability, even if some of the DNSSEC keys are misconfigured, incorrect or correspond to unsupported ciphers. We show that this design of DNSSEC is flawed. Exploiting vulnerable recommendations in the DNSSEC standards, we develop a new class of DNSSEC-based algorithmic complexity attacks on DNS, we dub KeyTrap attacks. All popular DNS implementations and services are vulnerable. With just a single DNS packet, the KeyTrap attacks lead to a 2.000.000x spike in CPU instruction count in vulnerable DNS resolvers, stalling some for as long as 16 hours. This devastating effect prompted major DNS vendors to refer to KeyTrap as the worst attack on DNS ever discovered. Exploiting KeyTrap, an attacker could effectively disable Internet access in any system utilizing a DNSSEC-validating resolver. We disclosed KeyTrap to vendors and operators on November 2, 2023, confidentially reporting the vulnerabilities to a closed group of DNS experts, operators and developers from the industry. Since then we have been working with all major vendors to mitigate KeyTrap, repeatedly discovering and assisting in closing weaknesses in proposed patches. Following our disclosure, the industry-wide umbrella CVE-2023-50387 has been assigned, covering the DNSSEC protocol vulnerabilities we present in this work.",

        "abstract": "COVID-19 caused an abrupt shift towards remote learning, and along with it, an increased adoption of remote, online proctoring technology to both dissuade and identify academic dishonesty (i.e., cheating). This shift also came with significant discontent from students who took to online platforms to both express their displea-sure with remote proctoring and the methods they used for evading monitoring methods, essentially discussing hacks to subvert the software and cheat on exams. In this paper, we seek to understand both the methods this online community shares for evading online proctoring and why they do so. Through qualitative analysis of social media videos ( \ud835\udc5b = 137 ) and comments ( \ud835\udc5b = 4 , 297 ) on YouTube and TikTok, we find both non-technical (e.g., sticky-notes) and deeply technical (e.g., custom virtual machines) methods of evading proctoring. The online videos, as well as the active comment sections, provide an important window into both an (unethical) desire to cheat but also the development of a security mindset . Many see proctoring software as invasive surveillance technology, and the discussion and sharing of methods to subvert it have similar tones to that of the hacker/tinkerer communities who also seek to share their experiences of subverting technology, for fun and profit. We conclude with lessons for the security and privacy community about evading online exam proctoring, as well as a conversation",

        "abstract": "Following the recent release of AI assistants, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, the software industry quickly utilized these tools for software development tasks, e.g., generating code or consulting AI for advice. While recent research has demonstrated that AI-generated code can contain security issues, how software professionals balance AI assistant usage and security remains unclear. This paper investigates how software professionals use AI assistants in secure software development, what security implications and considerations arise, and what impact they foresee on secure software development. We conducted 27 semi-structured interviews with software professionals, including software engineers, team leads, and security testers. We also reviewed 190 relevant Reddit posts and comments to gain insights into the current discourse surrounding AI assistants for software development. Our analysis of the interviews and Reddit posts finds that despite many security and quality concerns, participants widely use AI assistants for security-critical tasks, e.g., code generation, threat modeling, and vulnerability detection. Their overall mistrust leads to checking AI suggestions in similar ways to human code, although they expect improvements and, therefore, a heavier use for security tasks in the future. We conclude with recommendations for software professionals to critically check AI suggestions, AI creators to improve suggestion security and capabilities for ethical security tasks, and academic researchers to consider general-purpose AI in software development.",

        "title": "Content, Nudges and Incentives: A Study on the Effectiveness and Perception of Embedded Phishing Training",
        "abstract": "A common form of phishing training in organizations is the use of simulated phishing emails to test employees' susceptibility to phishing attacks, and the immediate delivery of training material to those who fail the test. This widespread practice is dubbed embedded training; however, its effectiveness in decreasing the likelihood of employees falling for phishing again in the future is questioned by the contradictory findings of several recent field studies. We investigate embedded phishing training in three aspects. First, we observe that the practice incorporates different components -- knowledge gains from its content, nudges and reminders from the test itself, and the deterrent effect of potential consequences -- our goal is to study which ones are more effective, if any. Second, we explore two potential improvements to training, namely its timing and the use of incentives. Third, we analyze employees' reception and perception of the practice. For this, we conducted a large-scale mixed-methods (quantitative and qualitative) study on the employees of a partner company. Our study contributes several novel findings on the training practice: in particular, its effectiveness comes from its nudging effect, i.e., the periodic reminder of the threat rather than from its content, which is rarely consumed by employees due to lack of time and perceived usefulness. Further, delaying training to ease time pressure is as effective as currently established practices, while rewards do not improve secure behavior. Finally, some of our results support previous findings with increased ecological validity, e.g., that phishing is an attention problem, rather than a knowledge one, even for the most susceptible employees, and thus enforcing training does not help.",

        "title": "Blocking Tracking JavaScript at the Function Granularity",
        "abstract": "Modern websites extensively rely on JavaScript to implement both functionality and tracking. Existing privacy enhancing content blocking tools struggle against mixed scripts, which simultaneously implement both functionality and tracking, because blocking the script would break functionality and not blocking it would allow tracking. We propose Not.js, a fine grained JavaScript blocking tool that operates at the function level granularity. Not.js's strengths lie in analyzing the dynamic execution context, including the call stack and calling context of each JavaScript function, and then encoding this context to build a rich graph representation. Not.js trains a supervised machine learning classifier on a webpage's graph representation to first detect tracking at the JavaScript function level and then automatically generate surrogate scripts that preserve functionality while removing tracking. Our evaluation of Not.js on the top 10K websites demonstrates that it achieves high precision (94%) and recall (98%) in detecting tracking JavaScript functions, outperforming the state of the art while being robust against off the shelf JavaScript obfuscation. Fine grained detection of tracking functions allows Not.js to automatically generate surrogate scripts that remove tracking JavaScript functions without causing major breakage. Our deployment of Not.js shows that mixed scripts are present on 62.3% of the top 10K websites, with 70.6% of the mixed scripts being third party that engage in tracking activities such as cookie ghostwriting. We share a sample of the tracking functions detected by Not.js within mixed scripts not currently on filter lists with filter list authors, who confirm that these scripts are not blocked due to potential functionality breakage, despite being known to implement tracking.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Authentication is the first, crucial step in securing digital assets like cryptocurrencies and online services like banking and social networks. It relies on principals maintaining exclusive access to credentials like cryptographic signing keys, passwords, and physical devices. But both individuals and organizations struggle to manage their credentials, resulting in loss of assets and identity theft. Multi-factor authentication improves security, but its analysis and design are mostly limited to one-shot mechanisms , which decide immediately. In this work, we study mechanisms with back-and-forth interaction with the principals. For example, a user receives an email notification about sending money from her bank account and is given a period of time to abort the operation. We formally define the authentication problem , where an authentication mechanism interacts with a user and an attacker and tries to identify the user. A mechanism\u2019s success depends on the scenario \u2013 whether the user / attacker know the different credentials; each credential can be safe, lost, leaked, or stolen. The profile of a mechanism is the set of all scenarios in which it succeeds. Thus, we have a partial order on mechanisms, defined by the subset relation on their profiles. We find an upper bound on the profile size and discover three types of n -credential mechanisms (for any n ) that are maximally secure , meeting this bound. We show these are all the unique maximal mechanisms for n \u2264 3 . We show the efficacy of our model by analyzing existing mechanisms, both theoretical and deployed in widely-used systems, and make concrete improvement proposals. We demonstrate the practicality of our mechanisms by implementing a maximally-secure cryptocurrency wallet.",

        "abstract": "Trusted execution environments (TEEs) are widely employed to protect deep neural networks (DNNs) from untrusted hosts (e.g., hypervisors). By shielding DNNs as fully black-box via encryption, TEEs mitigate model weight leakage and its follow-up white-box attacks. However, this paper uncovers that the confidentiality of TEE-shielded DNNs can be violated due to an emerging threat towards TEEs: ciphertext side channels of TEEs create weight-dependent observations during a DNN\u2019s execution. Despite the potential of inferring DNN weights from ciphertext side channels, existing techniques are inapplicable due to their over-strong requirements and the high precision required by DNN weights. A DNN can have millions of weight elements, and even a few incorrectly recovered weight elements may make the DNN non-functional. We propose a novel viewpoint that focuses on the functionality of DNN weights, rather than each weight element\u2019s exact value. Accordingly, we design HyperTheft to directly generate weights that are functionality-equivalent to the victim DNN using ciphertext side channels. HyperTheft is established for highly practical settings; it exhibits the weakest requirement compared to prior methods. When only knowing a victim DNN\u2019s input type and task type (which are public and denote the minimal information required to use a DNN), HyperTheft can recover its weight using ciphertext side channels logged during the victim DNN\u2019s one execution. The whole procedure does not require attackers to 1) query the",

        "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) is widely employed to provide privacy protection for individuals by limiting information leakage from the aggregated data. Two well-known models of DP are the central model and the local model. The former requires a trustworthy server for data aggregation, while the latter requires individuals to add noise, significantly decreasing the utility of aggregated results. Recently, many studies have proposed to achieve DP with Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) in distributed settings, namely, the distributed model, which has utility comparable to central model while, under specific security assumptions, preventing parties from obtaining others' information. One challenge of realizing DP in distributed model is efficiently sampling noise with MPC. Although many secure sampling methods have been proposed, they have different security assumptions and isolated theoretical analyses. There is a lack of experimental evaluations to measure and compare their performances. We fill this gap by benchmarking existing sampling protocols in MPC and performing comprehensive measurements of their efficiency. First, we present a taxonomy of the underlying techniques of these sampling protocols. Second, we extend widely used distributed noise generation protocols to be resilient against Byzantine attackers. Third, we implement discrete sampling protocols and align their security settings for a fair comparison. We then conduct an extensive evaluation to study their efficiency and utility.",

        "abstract": "Email attachments have become a favored delivery vector for malware campaigns. In response, email attachment detectors are widely deployed to safeguard email security. However, an emerging threat arises when adversaries exploit parsing discrepancies between email detectors and clients to evade detection. Currently, uncovering these vulnerabilities still depends on manual, ad hoc methods. In this paper, we perform the first systematic evaluation of email attachment detection against parsing ambiguity vulnerabilities. We propose a novel testing methodology, MIMEminer, to systematically discover evasion vulnerabilities in email systems. We evaluated our methodology against 16 content detectors of popular email services like Gmail and iCloud, and 7 popular email clients like Outlook and Thunderbird. In total, we discovered 19 new evasion methods affecting all tested email services and clients. We further analyzed these vulnerabilities and identified three primary categories of malware evasions. We have responsibly reported those identified vulnerabilities to the affected providers to help with the remediation of such vulnerabilities and received acknowledgments from Google Gmail,",

        "abstract": "Modern Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) implement the Visual Perception Module (VPM) to perceive their surroundings. This VPM adopts various Deep Neural Network (DNN) models to process the data collected from cameras and LiDAR. Prior studies have shown that these models are vulnerable to physical adversarial examples (PAEs), which pose a critical safety risk to the autonomous driving task. While a few defense methods have been proposed to safeguard AVs, most of them only target a limited set of attack types and specific scenarios, making them impractical for real-world protection. In this paper, we introduce VisionGuard , a novel and practical methodology to comprehensively detect and mitigate various types of PAEs to the VPM. The key of VisionGuard is to leverage the spatiotemporal inconsistency property of PAEs to detect anomalies. It predicts the motion states from historical ones and compares them with the current driving states to identify any motion inconsistency caused by physical attacks. We evaluate 9 state-of-the-art PAEs against both camera and camera-LiDAR fusion-based object classification & detection models. Experimental results in both simulation and physical world validate the effectiveness",

        "abstract": "Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks identify the websites visited by users by performing traffic analysis, compromising user privacy. Particularly, DL-based WF attacks demonstrate impressive attack performance. However, the effectiveness of DL-based WF attacks relies on the collected complete and pure traffic during the page loading, which impacts the practicality of these attacks. The WF performance is rather low under dynamic network conditions and various WF defenses, particularly when the analyzed traffic is only a small part of the complete traffic. In this paper, we propose Holmes, a robust and reliable early-stage WF attack. Holmes utilizes temporal and spatial distribution analysis of website traffic to effectively identify websites in the early stages of page loading. Specifically, Holmes develops adaptive data augmentation based on the temporal distribution of website traffic and utilizes a supervised contrastive learning method to extract the correlations between the early-stage traffic and the pre-collected complete traffic. Holmes accurately identifies traffic in the early stages of page loading by computing the correlation of the traffic with the spatial distribution information, which ensures robust and reliable detection according to early-stage traffic. We extensively evaluate Holmes using six datasets. Compared to nine existing DL-based WF attacks, Holmes improves the F1-score of identifying early-stage traffic by an average of 169.18%. Furthermore, we replay the traffic of visiting real-world dark web websites. Holmes successfully identifies dark web websites when the ratio of page loading on average is only 21.71%, with an average precision improvement of 169.36% over the existing WF attacks.",

        "title": "SeMalloc: Semantics-Informed Memory Allocator",
        "abstract": "Use-after-free (UAF) is a critical and prevalent problem in memory unsafe languages. While many solutions have been proposed, balancing security, run-time cost, and memory overhead (an impossible trinity) is hard. In this paper, we show one way to balance the trinity by passing more semantics about the heap object to the allocator for it to make informed allocation decisions. More specifically, we propose a new notion of thread-, context-, and flow-sensitive\"type\", SemaType, to capture the semantics and prototype a SemaType-based allocator that aims for the best trade-off amongst the impossible trinity. In SeMalloc, only heap objects allocated from the same call site and via the same function call stack can possibly share a virtual memory address, which effectively stops type-confusion attacks and makes UAF vulnerabilities harder to exploit. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we show that SeMalloc is realistic: (a) SeMalloc is effective in thwarting all real-world vulnerabilities we tested; (b) benchmark programs run even slightly faster with SeMalloc than the default heap allocator, at a memory overhead averaged from 41% to 84%; and (c) SeMalloc balances security and overhead strictly better than other closely related works.",

        "title": "SafeEar: Content Privacy-Preserving Audio Deepfake Detection",
        "abstract": "Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Voice Conversion (VC) models have exhibited remarkable performance in generating realistic and natural audio. However, their dark side, audio deepfake poses a significant threat to both society and individuals. Existing countermeasures largely focus on determining the genuineness of speech based on complete original audio recordings, which however often contain private content. This oversight may refrain deepfake detection from many applications, particularly in scenarios involving sensitive information like business secrets. In this paper, we propose SafeEar, a novel framework that aims to detect deepfake audios without relying on accessing the speech content within. Our key idea is to devise a neural audio codec into a novel decoupling model that well separates the semantic and acoustic information from audio samples, and only use the acoustic information (e.g., prosody and timbre) for deepfake detection. In this way, no semantic content will be exposed to the detector. To overcome the challenge of identifying diverse deepfake audio without semantic clues, we enhance our deepfake detector with real-world codec augmentation. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets demonstrate SafeEar's effectiveness in detecting various deepfake techniques with an equal error rate (EER) down to 2.02%. Simultaneously, it shields five-language speech content from being deciphered by both machine and human auditory analysis, demonstrated by word error rates (WERs) all above 93.93% and our user study. Furthermore, our benchmark constructed for anti-deepfake and anti-content recovery evaluation helps provide a basis for future research in the realms of audio privacy preservation and deepfake detection.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes Proteus, a protocol state machine, property-guided, and budget-aware automated testing approach for discovering logical vulnerabilities in wireless protocol implementations. Proteus maintains its budget awareness by generating test cases (i.e., each being a sequence of protocol messages) that are not only meaningful (i.e., the test case mostly follows the desirable protocol flow except for some controlled deviations) but also have a high probability of violating the desirable properties. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluated Proteus in two different protocol implementations, namely 4G LTE and BLE, across 23 consumer devices (11 for 4G LTE and 12 for BLE). Proteus discovered 25 unique issues, including 112 instances. Affected vendors have positively acknowledged 14 vulnerabilities through 5 CVEs.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the growth of mobile advertising has been driven by in-app programmatic advertising and technologies like Real-Time Bidding (RTB). However, this growth has also led to an increase in ad fraud, such as click injection, background ad activity, etc. While existing studies have primarily concentrated on ad fraud within individual apps or devices, this paper introduces a new form of collusion-based ad fraud, named ad attribution laundering fraud ( ALF ). ALF involves multiple apps collaborating to deceive advertisers by misrepresenting the app where ads are displayed. The collusion-based approach allows lower-quality apps to exploit the reputable identities of seemingly legitimate apps. This deceives ad-vertisers or ad networks into believing that the advertisements they place are reaching potentially valid end-users on the legitimate app. The seemingly legitimate ad events and ad attribution procedures employed by individual apps in such attacks can evade detection by existing tools. To detect ALF , we design and implement the first detection framework, AlfScan. It overcomes two challenges to extract apps\u2019 identities from diverse and obfuscated apps using both static and dynamic analysis techniques, then cross-check the identities to identify ALF . We evaluate AlfScan on a 200-app ground truth dataset, and it achieves 92% precision and 92% recall. We use AlfS-can to conduct a large-scale analysis on 91 , 006 apps and identify 4 , 515 unique fraudulent apps and 1 , 483 fraudulent clusters, exposing patterns among fraudulent developers and revealing reliability",

        "abstract": "Face recognition systems have been targeted by recent physical adversarial machine learning attacks, which attach or project visible patterns on adversaries\u2019 faces to trick backend FR models. While these attacks have demonstrated effectiveness in the literature, they often rely on visibly suspicious patterns, are susceptible to environmental noise, or exhibit limited success rates in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel physical adversarial attack against deep face recognition systems, namely Agile (adversarial glasses with infrared laser). It generates adjustable, invisible laser perturbations and emits them into the camera CMOS to launch dodging and impersonation attacks against facial biometrics systems. To do so, we first theoretically model physical adversarial perturbations and convert them to the digital domain. The generated synthesized attack signals are utilized to guide real-world laser settings. Our experiments with real-world attackers and a benchmark face database show that Agile is highly effective in DoS, dodging, and imperson-ation attacks. More importantly, the candidate impersonation target and optimal attack settings identified by Agile \u2019s attack synthesis approach are highly consistent with real-world physical attack re-sults. The grey-box and black-box evaluation against commercial FR models also confirms the effectiveness of the Agile attack.",

        "abstract": "Order manipulation attacks such as frontrunning and sandwich-ing have become an increasing concern in blockchain applications such as DeFi. To protect from such attacks, several recent works have designed order policy enforcement (OPE) protocols to order transactions fairly in a data-independent fashion. However, while the manipulation attacks are motivated by monetary profits, the defenses assume honesty among a significantly large set of participants. In existing protocols, if all participants are rational , they may be incentivized to collude and circumvent the order policy without incurring any penalty. Thisworkmakestwokeycontributions. First,weexplorewhether the need for the honesty assumption is fundamental. Indeed, we show that it is impossible to design OPE protocols under some requirements when all parties are rational. Second, we explore the tradeoffs needed to circumvent the impossibility result. In the process, we propose a novel concept of rationally binding transactions that allows us to construct AnimaguSwap 1 , the first content-oblivious Automated Market Makers (AMM) interface that is secure under rationality. We report on a prototype implementation of Ani-maguSwap and performance evaluation results demonstrating its practicality.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in natural language generation, but they have also been observed to magnify societal biases, particularly those related to gender. In response to this issue, several benchmarks have been proposed to assess gender bias in LLMs. However, these benchmarks often lack practical flexibility or inadvertently introduce biases. To address these shortcomings, we introduce GenderCARE, a comprehensive framework that encompasses innovative Criteria, bias Assessment, Reduction techniques, and Evaluation metrics for quantifying and mitigating gender bias in LLMs. To begin, we establish pioneering criteria for gender equality benchmarks, spanning dimensions such as inclusivity, diversity, explainability, objectivity, robustness, and realisticity. Guided by these criteria, we construct GenderPair, a novel pair-based benchmark designed to assess gender bias in LLMs comprehensively. Our benchmark provides standardized and realistic evaluations, including previously overlooked gender groups such as transgender and non-binary individuals. Furthermore, we develop effective debiasing techniques that incorporate counterfactual data augmentation and specialized fine-tuning strategies to reduce gender bias in LLMs without compromising their overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate a significant reduction in various gender bias benchmarks, with reductions peaking at over 90% and averaging above 35% across 17 different LLMs. Importantly, these reductions come with minimal variability in mainstream language tasks, remaining below 2%. By offering a realistic assessment and tailored reduction of gender biases, we hope that our GenderCARE can represent a significant step towards achieving fairness and equity in LLMs. More details are available at https://github.com/kstanghere/GenderCARE-ccs24.",

        "abstract": "Widespread efforts to subvert access to strong cryptography has renewed interest in steganography, the practice of embedding sensitive messages in mundane cover messages. Recent efforts at provably secure steganography have focused on text-based generative models and cannot support other types of models, such as diffusion models, which are used for high-quality image synthesis. In this work, we study securely embedding steganographic messages into the output of image diffusion models. We identify that the use of variance noise during image generation provides a suitable steganographic channel. We develop our construction, Pulsar , by building optimizations to make this channel practical for communication. Our implementation of Pulsar is capable of embedding \u2248 320\u2013613 bytes (on average) into a single image without altering the distribution of the generated image, all in < 3 seconds of online time on a laptop. In addition, we discuss how the results of Pulsar can inform future research into diffusion models. Pulsar shows that diffusion models are a promising medium for steganography and censorship resistance.",

        "abstract": "Ransomware attacks have emerged as one of the most significant cybersecurity threats. Despite numerous proposed detection and defense methods, existing approaches face two fundamental limitations in large-scale industrial applications: intolerable system overheads and notorious alert fatigue. To address these challenges, we propose CanCal, a real-time and lightweight ransomware detection system. Specifically, CanCal selectively filters suspicious processes by the monitoring layers and then performs in-depth behavioral analysis to isolate ransomware activities from benign operations, minimizing alert fatigue while ensuring lightweight computational and storage overhead. The experimental results on a large-scale industrial environment~(1,761 ransomware, ~3 million events, continuous test over 5 months) indicate that CanCal is as effective as state-of-the-art techniques while enabling rapid inference within 30ms and real-time response within a maximum of 3 seconds. CanCal dramatically reduces average CPU utilization by 91.04% (from 6.7% to 0.6%) and peak CPU utilization by 76.69% (from 26.6% to 6.2%), while avoiding 76.50% (from 3,192 to 750) of the inspection efforts from security analysts. By the time of this writing, CanCal has been integrated into a commercial product and successfully deployed on 3.32 million endpoints for over a year. From March 2023 to April 2024, CanCal successfully detected and thwarted 61 ransomware attacks, demonstrating the effectiveness of CanCal in combating sophisticated ransomware threats in real-world scenarios.",

        "title": "SeqMIA: Sequential-Metric Based Membership Inference Attack",
        "abstract": "Most existing membership inference attacks (MIAs) utilize metrics (e.g., loss) calculated on the model's final state, while recent advanced attacks leverage metrics computed at various stages, including both intermediate and final stages, throughout the model training. Nevertheless, these attacks often process multiple intermediate states of the metric independently, ignoring their time-dependent patterns. Consequently, they struggle to effectively distinguish between members and non-members who exhibit similar metric values, particularly resulting in a high false-positive rate. In this study, we delve deeper into the new membership signals in the black-box scenario. We identify a new, more integrated membership signal: the Pattern of Metric Sequence, derived from the various stages of model training. We contend that current signals provide only partial perspectives of this new signal: the new one encompasses both the model's multiple intermediate and final states, with a greater emphasis on temporal patterns among them. Building upon this signal, we introduce a novel attack method called Sequential-metric based Membership Inference Attack (SeqMIA). Specifically, we utilize knowledge distillation to obtain a set of distilled models representing various stages of the target model's training. We then assess multiple metrics on these distilled models in chronological order, creating distilled metric sequence. We finally integrate distilled multi-metric sequences as a sequential multiformat and employ an attention-based RNN attack model for inference. Empirical results show SeqMIA outperforms all baselines, especially can achieve an order of magnitude improvement in terms of TPR @ 0.1% FPR. Furthermore, we delve into the reasons why this signal contributes to SeqMIA's high attack performance, and assess various defense mechanisms against SeqMIA.",

        "abstract": "Graph-based anomaly detection is pivotal in diverse security applications, such as fraud detection in transaction networks and intrusion detection for network traffic. Standard approaches, including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), often struggle to generalize across shifting data distributions. Meanwhile, real-world domain knowledge is more stable and a common existing component of real-world detection strategies. To explicitly integrate such knowledge into data-driven models such as GCNs, we propose KnowGraph, which integrates domain knowledge with data-driven learning for enhanced graph-based anomaly detection. KnowGraph comprises two principal components: (1) a statistical learning component that utilizes a main model for the overarching detection task, augmented by multiple specialized knowledge models that predict domain-specific semantic entities; (2) a reasoning component that employs probabilistic graphical models to execute logical inferences based on model outputs, encoding domain knowledge through weighted first-order logic formulas. Extensive experiments on these large-scale real-world datasets show that KnowGraph consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both transductive and inductive settings, achieving substantial gains in average precision when generalizing to completely unseen test graphs. Further ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed reasoning component in improving detection performance, especially under extreme class imbalance. These results highlight the potential of integrating domain knowledge into data-driven models for high-stakes, graph-based security applications.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces SGCode, a flexible prompt-optimizing system to generate secure code with large language models (LLMs). SGCode integrates recent prompt-optimization approaches with LLMs in a unified system accessible through front-end and back-end APIs, enabling users to 1) generate secure code, which is free of vulnerabilities, 2) review and share security analysis, and 3) easily switch from one prompt optimization approach to another, while providing insights on model and system performance. We populated SGCode on an AWS server with PromSec, an approach that optimizes prompts by combining an LLM and security tools with a lightweight generative adversarial graph neural network to detect and fix security vulnerabilities in the generated code. Extensive experiments show that SGCode is practical as a public tool to gain insights into the trade-offs between model utility, secure code generation, and system cost. SGCode has only a marginal cost compared with prompting LLMs. SGCode is available at: https://sgcode.codes/.",

        "abstract": "Current implementations of differentially-private (DP) systems either lack support to track the global privacy budget consumed on a dataset, or fail to faithfully maintain the state continuity of this budget. We show that failure to maintain a privacy budget enables an adversary to mount replay, rollback and fork attacks - obtaining answers to many more queries than what a secure system would allow. As a result the attacker can reconstruct secret data that DP aims to protect - even if DP code runs in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). We propose ElephantDP, a system that aims to provide the same guarantees as a trusted curator in the global DP model would, albeit set in an untrusted environment. Our system relies on a state continuity module to provide protection for the privacy budget and a TEE to faithfully execute DP code and update the budget. To provide security, our protocol makes several design choices including the content of the persistent state and the order between budget updates and query answers. We prove that ElephantDP provides liveness (i.e., the protocol can restart from a correct state and respond to queries as long as the budget is not exceeded) and DP confidentiality (i.e., an attacker learns about a dataset as much as it would from interacting with a trusted curator). Our implementation and evaluation of the protocol use Intel SGX as a TEE to run the DP code and a network of TEEs to maintain state continuity. Compared to an insecure baseline, we observe 1.1-3.2$\\times$ overheads and lower relative overheads for complex DP queries.",

        "abstract": "Web cache poisoning (WCP) has posed significant threats to Internet security by causing the cache server to deliver malicious responses to innocent users. This results in widespread denial of access to website resources and potential injection of harmful payloads. However, prior works on WCP vulnerability have been fragmented and conducted in a case-by-case form, lacking a systematic analysis of the threat landscape. In this paper, we fill this research gap by conducting a systematic evaluation of WCP vulnerabilities at scale. We propose HCache , a novel testing methodology to facilitates the widespread identification of WCP vulnerabilities. We evaluated our methodology against Tranco Top 1000 domains and their sub-domains, and found that over 1,000 websites across 172 domains, representing 17% of the evaluated domains, are vulnerable to WCP. In particular, we have identified 7 new attack vectors stemming from previously unexplored caching headers. We have responsibly disclosed the vulnerabilities to the affected websites and received ac-knowledgements and bug bounties from world-famous companies, such as Alibaba, Adobe, Huawei, and Microsoft.",

        "abstract": "The capability of generating high-quality source code using large language models (LLMs) reduces software development time and costs. However, they often introduce security vulnerabilities due to training on insecure open-source data. This highlights the need for ensuring secure and functional code generation. This paper introduces PromSec, an algorithm for prom optimization for secure and functioning code generation using LLMs. In PromSec, we combine 1) code vulnerability clearing using a generative adversarial graph neural network, dubbed as gGAN, to fix and reduce security vulnerabilities in generated codes and 2) code generation using an LLM into an interactive loop, such that the outcome of the gGAN drives the LLM with enhanced prompts to generate secure codes while preserving their functionality. Introducing a new contrastive learning approach in gGAN, we formulate code-clearing and generation as a dual-objective optimization problem, enabling PromSec to notably reduce the number of LLM inferences. PromSec offers a cost-effective and practical solution for generating secure, functional code. Extensive experiments conducted on Python and Java code datasets confirm that PromSec effectively enhances code security while upholding its intended functionality. Our experiments show that while a state-of-the-art approach fails to address all code vulnerabilities, PromSec effectively resolves them. Moreover, PromSec achieves more than an order-of-magnitude reduction in operation time, number of LLM queries, and security analysis costs. Furthermore, prompts optimized with PromSec for a certain LLM are transferable to other LLMs across programming languages and generalizable to unseen vulnerabilities in training. This study is a step in enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs for secure and functional code generation, supporting their integration into real-world software development.",

        "title": "ZeroFake: Zero-Shot Detection of Fake Images Generated and Edited by Text-to-Image Generation Models",
        "abstract": "The text-to-image generation model has attracted significant interest from both academic and industrial communities. These models can generate the images based on the given prompt descriptions. Their potent capabilities, while beneficial, also present risks. Previous efforts relied on the approach of training binary classifiers to detect the generated fake images, which is inefficient, lacking in generalizability, and non-robust. In this paper, we propose the novel zero-shot detection method, called ZeroFake, to distinguish fake images apart from real ones by utilizing a perturbation-based DDIM inversion technique. ZeroFake is inspired by the findings that fake images are more robust than real images during the process of DDIM inversion and reconstruction. Specifically, for a given image, ZeroFake first generates noise with DDIM inversion guided by adversary prompts. Then, ZeroFake reconstructs the image from the generated noise. Subsequently, it compares the reconstructed image with the original image to determine whether it is fake or real. By exploiting the differential response of fake and real images to the adversary prompts during the inversion and reconstruction process, our model offers a more robust and efficient method to detect fake images without the extensive data and training costs. Extensive results demonstrate that the proposed ZeroFake can achieve great performance in fake image detection, fake artwork detection, and fake edited image detection. We further illustrate the robustness of the proposed ZeroFake by showcasing its resilience against potential adversary attacks. We hope that our solution can better assist the community in achieving the arrival of a more efficient and fair AGI",

We conducted a thematic analysis of 38 online de-identification guides for practitioners, to understand what content they contain and how they are designed to support decision-making and execution. We highlight trends and differences between guides, and we find some concerning patterns, including inconsistent definitions of key terms, gaps in coverage of threats to de-identification, and areas for improvement in usability. We identify directions for future research and suggest changes to de-identification guidance in order to better support practitioners in conducting effective de-identification.",

        "abstract": "Cellular network infrastructure serves as the backbone of modern mobile wireless communication. As such, cellular cores must be proactively secured against external threats to ensure reliable service. Compromised base station attacks against the core are a rising threat to cellular networks, while user device inputs have long been considered as an attack vector; despite this, few techniques exist to comprehensively test RAN-Core interfaces against malicious input. In this work, we devise a fuzzing framework that perfor-mantly fuzzes cellular interfaces accessible from a base station or user device, overcoming several challenges in fuzzing specific to LTE/5G network components. We also introduce ASNFuzzGen, a tool that compiles ASN.1 specifications into structure-aware fuzzing modules, thereby facilitating effective fuzzing exploration of complex cellular protocols. We run fuzzing campaigns against seven open-source and commercial cores and discover 119 vulnerabilities, with 93 CVEs assigned. Our results reveal common implementation mistakes across several cores that lead to vulnerabilities, and the successful coordination of patches for these vulnerabilities across several vendors demonstrates the practical impact ASNFuzzGen has on hardening user-exposed cellular systems.",

        "title": "SpecGuard: Specification Aware Recovery for Robotic Autonomous Vehicles from Physical Attacks",
        "abstract": "Robotic Autonomous Vehicles (RAVs) rely on their sensors for perception, and follow strict mission specifications (e.g., altitude, speed, and geofence constraints) for safe and timely operations. Physical attacks can corrupt the RAVs' sensors, resulting in mission failures. Recovering RAVs from such attacks demands robust control techniques that maintain compliance with mission specifications even under attacks to ensure the RAV's safety and timely operations. We propose SpecGuard, a technique that complies with mission specifications and performs safe recovery of RAVs. There are two innovations in SpecGuard. First, it introduces an approach to incorporate mission specifications and learn a recovery control policy using Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep-RL). We design a compliance-based reward structure that reflects the RAV's complex dynamics and enables SpecGuard to satisfy multiple mission specifications simultaneously. Second, SpecGuard incorporates state reconstruction, a technique that minimizes attack induced sensor perturbations. This reconstruction enables effective adversarial training, and optimizing the recovery control policy for robustness under attacks. We evaluate SpecGuard in both virtual and real RAVs, and find that it achieves 92% recovery success rate under attacks on different sensors, without any crashes or stalls. SpecGuard achieves 2X higher recovery success than prior work, and incurs about 15% performance overhead on real RAVs.",

        "title": "Payout Races and Congested Channels: A Formal Analysis of Security in the Lightning Network",
        "abstract": "The Lightning Network, a payment channel network with a market cap of over 192M USD, is designed to resolve Bitcoin's scalability issues through fast off-chain transactions. There are multiple Lightning Network client implementations, all of which conform to the same textual specifications known as BOLTs. Several vulnerabilities have been manually discovered, but to-date there have been few works systematically analyzing the security of the Lightning Network. In this work, we take a foundational approach to analyzing the security of the Lightning Network with the help of formal methods. Based on the BOLTs' specifications, we build a detailed formal model of the Lightning Network's single-hop payment protocol and verify it using the Spin model checker. Our model captures both concurrency and error semantics of the payment protocol. We then define several security properties which capture the correct intermediate operation of the protocol, ensuring that the outcome is always certain to both channel peers, and using them we re-discover a known attack previously reported in the literature along with a novel attack, referred to as a Payout Race. A Payout Race consists of a particular sequence of events that can lead to an ambiguity in the protocol in which innocent users can unwittingly lose funds. We confirm the practicality of this attack by reproducing it in a local testbed environment.",

        "abstract": "Existing protocols for proving the correct execution of a RAM program in zero-knowledge are plagued by a processor expressiveness tradeoff : supporting fewer instructions results in smaller processor circuits (which improves performance), but may result in more program execution steps because non-supported instruction must be emulated over multiple processor steps (diminishing performance). We present Dora , a very simple and concretely efficient zero-knowledge protocol for RAM programs that sidesteps this tension by making it (nearly) free to add additional instructions to the processor. The computational and communication complexity of proving each step of a computation in Dora , is constant in the number of supported instructions. Dora \u2019s approach is united by intuitive abstraction we call a ZKBag, a cryptographic primitive constructed from linearly homomorphic commitments that captures the properties of a physical bag. We implement Dora and demonstrate that on commodity hardware it can prove the correct execution of a processor with thousands of instruction, each of which has thousands of gates, in just a few milliseconds per step.",

        "abstract": "In AR/VR devices, the voice interface, serving as one of the primary AR/VR control mechanisms, enables users to interact naturally using speeches (voice commands) for accessing data, controlling applications, and engaging in remote communication/meetings. Voice authentication can be adopted to protect against unauthorized speech inputs. However, existing voice authentication mechanisms are usually susceptible to voice spoofing attacks and are unreliable under the variations of phonetic content. In this work, we propose SAFARI, a spoofing-resistant and text-independent speech authentication system that can be seamlessly integrated into AR/VR voice interfaces. The key idea is to elicit phonetic-invariant biometrics from the facial muscle vibrations upon the headset. During speech production, a user\u2019s facial muscles are de-formed for articulating phoneme sounds. The facial deformations associated with the phonemes are referred to as visemes. They carry rich biometrics of the wearer\u2019s muscles, tissue, and bones, which can propagate through the head and vibrate the headset. SAFARI aims to derive reliable facial biometrics from the viseme-associated facial vibrations captured by the AR/VR motion sensors. Particularly, it identifies the vibration data segments that contain rich viseme patterns (prominent visemes) less susceptible to phonetic variations. Based on the prominent visemes, SAFARI learns on the correlations among facial vibrations of different frequencies to extract biometric representations invariant to the phonetic context.

        "abstract": "We introduce the notion of a conditional encryption scheme as an extension of public key encryption. In addition to the standard public key algorithms ($\\mathsf{KG}$, $\\mathsf{Enc}$, $\\mathsf{Dec}$) for key generation, encryption and decryption, a conditional encryption scheme for a binary predicate $P$ adds a new conditional encryption algorithm $\\mathsf{CEnc}$. The conditional encryption algorithm $c=\\mathsf{CEnc}_{pk}(c_1,m_2,m_3)$ takes as input the public encryption key $pk$, a ciphertext $c_1 = \\mathsf{Enc}_{pk}(m_1)$ for an unknown message $m_1$, a control message $m_2$ and a payload message $m_3$ and outputs a conditional ciphertext $c$. Intuitively, if $P(m_1,m_2)=1$ then the conditional ciphertext $c$ should decrypt to the payload message $m_3$. On the other hand if $P(m_1,m_2) = 0$ then the ciphertext should not leak any information about the control message $m_2$ or the payload message $m_3$ even if the attacker already has the secret decryption key $sk$. We formalize the notion of conditional encryption secrecy and provide concretely efficient constructions for a set of predicates relevant to password typo correction. Our practical constructions utilize the Paillier partially homomorphic encryption scheme as well as Shamir Secret Sharing. We prove that our constructions are secure and demonstrate how to use conditional encryption to improve the security of personalized password typo correction systems such as TypTop. We implement a C++ library for our practically efficient conditional encryption schemes and evaluate the performance empirically. We also update the implementation of TypTop to utilize conditional encryption for enhanced security guarantees and evaluate the performance of the updated implementation.",

        "abstract": "Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a short-range wireless communication technology for resource-constrained IoT devices. Unfortunately, BLE is vulnerable to session-based attacks, where previous packets construct exploitable conditions for subsequent packets to compromise connections. Defending against session-based attacks is challenging because each step in the attack sequence is legitimate when inspected individually. In this paper, we present BlueSWAT, a lightweight state-aware security framework for protecting BLE devices. To perform inspection on the session level rather than individual packets, BlueSWAT leverages a finite state machine (FSM) to monitor sequential actions of connections at runtime. Patterns of session-based attacks are modeled as malicious transition paths in the FSM. To overcome the heterogeneous IoT environment, we develop a lightweight eBPF framework to facilitate universal patch distribution across different BLE architectures and stacks, without requiring device reboot. We implement BlueSWAT on 5 real-world devices with different chips and stacks to demonstrate its cross-device adaptability. On our dataset with 101 real-world BLE vulnerabilities, BlueSWAT can mitigate 76.1% of session-based attacks, outperforming other defense frameworks. In our end-to-end application evaluation, BlueSWAT patches introduce an average of 0.073% memory overhead and negligible latency.",

        "abstract": "Satellite modems are critical components in satellite communication networks. Especially, they determine the entire communication regime in traditional systems where the satellites only act as transparent relays. However, unlike satellites that are usually more isolated and better protected, satellite modems are accessible and susceptible to lower-cost attacks, potentially serving as a weak link in the chain of satellite communication security. We make the first attempt to shed light on satellite modem security. We first physically disassemble commodity satellite modems and systematically examine hardware and software modules. We perform a measurement study on the satellite modems that are exposed to the Internet. We identify 16 security vulnerabilities across three attack surfaces: satellite communication interface, ground network interface, and hardware. We further introduce AirSecAnalyzer, an automated security analyzer/fuzzer for the modems\u2019 satellite communication interface. Through comprehensive analysis and extensive experiments on 9 real-world satellite modems, we report 18 novel attacks that exploit the identified vulnerabilities. Our findings are expected to contribute as a valuable foundation for future research on the security of satellite modems and satellite communication networks.",

        "abstract": "Unsolicited telephone calls that facilitate fraud or unlawful telemarketing continue to overwhelm network users and the regulators who prosecute them. The first step in prosecuting phone abuse is traceback -- identifying the call originator. This fundamental investigative task currently requires hours of manual effort per call. In this paper, we introduce J\\\"ager, a distributed secure call traceback system. J\\\"ager can trace a call in a few seconds, even with partial deployment, while cryptographically preserving the privacy of call parties, carrier trade secrets like peers and call volume, and limiting the threat of bulk analysis. We establish definitions and requirements of secure traceback, then develop a suite of protocols that meet these requirements using witness encryption, oblivious pseudorandom functions, and group signatures. We prove these protocols secure in the universal composibility framework. We then demonstrate that J\\\"ager has low compute and bandwidth costs per call, and these costs scale linearly with call volume. J\\\"ager provides an efficient, secure, privacy-preserving system to revolutionize telephone abuse investigation with minimal costs to operators.",

        "abstract": "A surge in data-driven applications enhances everyday life but also raises serious concerns about private information leakage. Hence many privacy auditing tools are emerging for checking if the data sanitization performed meets the privacy standard of the data owner. Blackbox auditing for differential privacy is particularly gaining popularity for its effectiveness and applicability to a wide range of scenarios. Yet, we identified that blackbox auditing is essentially flawed with its setting: small probabilities or densities are ignored due to inaccurate observation. Our argument is based on a solid false positive analysis from a hypothesis testing perspective, which is missed out by prior blackbox auditing tools. This oversight greatly reduces the reliability of these tools, as it allows malicious or incapable data curators to pass the auditing with an overstated privacy guarantee, posing significant risks to data owners. We demonstrate the practical existence of such threats in classical differential privacy mechanisms against four representative blackbox auditors with experimental validations. Our findings aim to reveal the limitations of blackbox auditing tools, empower the data owner with the awareness of risks in using these tools, and encourage the development of more reliable differential privacy auditing methods.",

        "title": "BadMerging: Backdoor Attacks Against Model Merging",
        "abstract": "Fine-tuning pre-trained models for downstream tasks has led to a proliferation of open-sourced task-specific models. Recently, Model Merging (MM) has emerged as an effective approach to facilitate knowledge transfer among these independently fine-tuned models. MM directly combines multiple fine-tuned task-specific models into a merged model without additional training, and the resulting model shows enhanced capabilities in multiple tasks. Although MM provides great utility, it may come with security risks because an adversary can exploit MM to affect multiple downstream tasks. However, the security risks of MM have barely been studied. In this paper, we first find that MM, as a new learning paradigm, introduces unique challenges for existing backdoor attacks due to the merging process. To address these challenges, we introduce BadMerging, the first backdoor attack specifically designed for MM. Notably, BadMerging allows an adversary to compromise the entire merged model by contributing as few as one backdoored task-specific model. BadMerging comprises a two-stage attack mechanism and a novel feature-interpolation-based loss to enhance the robustness of embedded backdoors against the changes of different merging parameters. Considering that a merged model may incorporate tasks from different domains, BadMerging can jointly compromise the tasks provided by the adversary (on-task attack) and other contributors (off-task attack) and solve the corresponding unique challenges with novel attack designs. Extensive experiments show that BadMerging achieves remarkable attacks against various MM algorithms. Our ablation study demonstrates that the proposed attack designs can progressively contribute to the attack performance. Finally, we show that prior defense mechanisms fail to defend against our attacks, highlighting the need for more advanced defense.",

        "abstract": "Protecting system observability records (logs) from compromised OSs has gained significant traction in recent times, with several note-worthy approaches proposed. Unfortunately, none of the proposed approaches achieve high performance with tiny log protection delays. They also leverage risky environments for protection (\\eg many use general-purpose hypervisors or TrustZone, which have large TCB and attack surfaces). HitchHiker is an attempt to rectify this problem. The system is designed to ensure (a) in-memory protection of batched logs within a short and configurable real-time deadline by efficient hardware permission switching, and (b) an end-to-end high-assurance environment built upon hardware protection primitives with debloating strategies for secure log protection, persistence, and management. Security evaluations and validations show that HitchHiker reduces log protection delay by 93.3--99.3% compared to the state-of-the-art, while reducing TCB by 9.4--26.9X. Performance evaluations show HitchHiker incurs a geometric mean of less than 6% overhead on diverse real-world programs, improving on the state-of-the-art approach by 61.9--77.5%.",

        "abstract": "The advent of generative AI images has completely disrupted the art world. Distinguishing AI generated images from human art is a challenging problem whose impact is growing over time. A failure to address this problem allows bad actors to defraud individuals paying a premium for human art and companies whose stated policies forbid AI imagery. It is also critical for content owners to establish copyright, and for model trainers interested in curating training data in order to avoid potential model collapse. There are several different approaches to distinguishing human art from AI images, including classifiers trained by supervised learning, research tools targeting diffusion models, and identification by professional artists using their knowledge of artistic techniques. In this paper, we seek to understand how well these approaches can perform against today's modern generative models in both benign and adversarial settings. We curate real human art across 7 styles, generate matching images from 5 generative models, and apply 8 detectors (5 automated detectors and 3 different human groups including 180 crowdworkers, 4000+ professional artists, and 13 expert artists experienced at detecting AI). Both Hive and expert artists do very well, but make mistakes in different ways (Hive is weaker against adversarial perturbations while Expert artists produce higher false positives). We believe these weaknesses will remain as models continue to evolve, and use our data to demonstrate why a combined team of human and automated detectors provides the best combination of accuracy and robustness.",

        "abstract": "The Sixth Workshop on Forming an Ecosystem Around Software Transformation (FEAST) revives the series, with the original five events taking place from 2016-2020. FEAST is concerned with all aspects of achieving effective, robust, and appraisable late-stage transformation of software for security. Late-stage transformations allow third parties to deeply tailor existing software to their mission, customizing it with little to no access to source code or support from the original developer. Research has shown that late-stage software customization is of particular benefit to security-conscious software consumers who must use closed-source or source-free binary software components in mission-critical settings, or who must harden software against newly emerging attacks not anticipated during the software\u2019s original design and development. However, there is still a long way to go toward achieving sound and robust transformations whose holistic benefits to deployed software are fully appraisable. Motivated by these outstanding challenges, FEAST continues in its goal to form an active ecosystem of strategies and tools for accomplishing source-free binary code transformation reliably and on-demand.",

        "title": "FORAY: Towards Effective Attack Synthesis against Deep Logical Vulnerabilities in DeFi Protocols",
        "abstract": "Blockchain adoption has surged with the rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. However, the significant value of digital assets managed by DeFi protocols makes them prime targets for attacks. Current smart contract vulnerability detection tools struggle with DeFi protocols due to deep logical bugs arising from complex financial interactions between multiple smart contracts. These tools primarily analyze individual contracts and resort to brute-force methods for DeFi protocols crossing numerous smart contracts, leading to inefficiency. We introduce Foray, a highly effective attack synthesis framework against deep logical bugs in DeFi protocols. Foray proposes a novel attack sketch generation and completion framework. Specifically, instead of treating DeFis as regular programs, we design a domain-specific language (DSL) to lift the low-level smart contracts into their high-level financial operations. Based on our DSL, we first compile a given DeFi protocol into a token flow graph, our graphical representation of DeFi protocols. Then, we design an efficient sketch generation method to synthesize attack sketches for a certain attack goal (e.g., price manipulation, arbitrage, etc.). This algorithm strategically identifies candidate sketches by finding reachable paths in TFG, which is much more efficient than random enumeration. For each candidate sketch written in our DSL, Foray designs a domain-specific symbolic compilation to compile it into SMT constraints. Our compilation simplifies the constraints by removing redundant smart contract semantics. It maintains the usability of symbolic compilation, yet scales to problems orders of magnitude larger. Finally, the candidates are completed via existing solvers and are transformed into concrete attacks via direct syntax transformation.",

JudgeDeceiver injects a carefully crafted sequence into an attacker-controlled candidate response such that LLM-as-a-Judge selects the candidate response for an attacker-chosen question no matter what other candidate responses are. Specifically, we formulate finding such sequence as an optimization problem and propose a gradient based method to approximately solve it. Our extensive evaluation shows that JudgeDeceive is highly effective, and is much more effective than existing prompt injection attacks that manually craft the injected sequences and jailbreak attacks when extended to our problem. We also show the effectiveness of JudgeDeceiver in three case studies, i.e., LLM-powered search, RLAIF, and tool selection. Moreover, we consider defenses including known-answer detection, perplexity detection, and perplexity windowed detection. Our results show these defenses are insufficient, highlighting the urgent need for developing new defense strategies.

        "abstract": "We analyze bribing attacks in Proof-of-Stake distributed ledgers from a game theoretic perspective. In bribing attacks, an adversary offers participants a reward in exchange for instructing them how to behave, with the goal of attacking the protocol's properties. Specifically, our work focuses on adversaries that target blockchain safety. We consider two types of bribing, depending on how the bribes are awarded: i) guided bribing, where the bribe is given as long as the bribed party behaves as instructed; ii) effective bribing, where bribes are conditional on the attack's success, w.r.t. well-defined metrics. We analyze each type of attack in a game theoretic setting and identify relevant equilibria. In guided bribing, we show that the protocol is not an equilibrium and then describe good equilibria, where the attack is unsuccessful, and a negative one, where all parties are bribed such that the attack succeeds. In effective bribing, we show that both the protocol and the\"all bribed\"setting are equilibria. Using the identified equilibria, we then compute bounds on the Prices of Stability and Anarchy. Our results indicate that additional mitigations are needed for guided bribing, so our analysis concludes with incentive-based mitigation techniques, namely slashing and dilution. Here, we present two positive results, that both render the protocol an equilibrium and achieve maximal welfare for all parties, and a negative result, wherein an attack becomes more plausible if it severely affects the ledger's token's market price.",

        "abstract": "Software-defined networking (SDN) is a centralized, dynamic, and programmable network management technology that enables flexible traffic control and scalability. SDN facilitates network administration through a centralized view of the underlying physical topology; tampering with this topology view can result in catastrophic damage to network management and security. To underscore this issue, we introduce Marionette, a new topology poisoning technique that manipulates OpenFlow link discovery packet forwarding to alter topology information. Our approach exposes an overlooked yet widespread attack vector, distinguishing itself from traditional link fabrication attacks that tamper, spoof, or relay discovery packets at the data plane. Unlike localized attacks observed in existing methods, our technique introduces a globalized topology poisoning attack that leverages control privileges. Marionette implements a reinforcement learning algorithm to compute a poisoned topology target, and injects flow entries to achieve a long-lived stealthy attack. Our evaluation shows that Marionette successfully attacks five open-source controllers and nine OpenFlow-based discovery protocols. Marionette overcomes the state-of-the-art topology poisoning defenses, showcasing a new class of topology poisoning that initiates on the control plane. This security vulnerability was ethically disclosed to OpenDaylight, and CVE-2024-37018 has been assigned.",

        "abstract": "Surveying field-deployed Industrial Control System (ICS) equipment has numerous security applications, including attack-surface management and measuring the adoption of vulnerability patches. However, discovering real-world devices using massive Internet-scale scan datasets is tedious and error-prone. We introduce PL-CHound , a novel ICS asset discovery solution designed to automatically reveal elusive ICS devices hiding in network data collected by Internet-scale scanners such as Censys or Shodan. Our solution systematically uncovers indirect evidence of controllers using subtle network-based indicators and temporally-resistant signatures that are often overlooked in prior work. We present PLCHound \u2019s architecture, experimentally verify its accuracy, and explore the security advantages of enhanced device discovery. We also use PL-CHound to perform the largest comprehensive examination of the publicly-reachable population of ICS devices by popular vendors. Our results reveal that the industry-accepted estimations and latest published papers undercount the true number of public devices by up to 37x. We also find that 95.88% of devices expose protocols that cause them to be remotely vulnerable to recent critical CVEs.",

        "abstract": "Control-flow leakage (CFL) attacks enable an attacker to expose control-flow decisions of a victim program via side-channel observations. Linearization (i.e., elimination) of secret-dependent control flow is the main countermeasure against these attacks, yet it comes at a non-negligible cost. Conversely, balancing secret-dependent branches often incurs a smaller overhead, but is notoriously insecure on high-end processors. Hence, linearization has been widely believed to be the only effective countermeasure against CFL attacks. In this paper, we challenge this belief and investigate an unexplored alternative: how to securely balance secret-dependent branches on higher-end processors? We propose Libra, a generic and principled hardware-software codesign to efficiently address CFL on high-end processors. We perform a systematic classification of hardware primitives leaking control flow from the literature, and provide guidelines to handle them with our design. Importantly, Libra enables secure control-flow balancing without the need to disable performance-critical hardware such as the instruction cache and the prefetcher. We formalize the semantics of Libra and propose a code transformation algorithm for securing programs, which we prove correct and secure. Finally, we implement and evaluate Libra on an out-of-order RISC-V processor, showing performance overhead on par with insecure balanced code, and outperforming state-of-the-art linearized code by 19.3%.",

        "abstract": "Code coverage is an effective objective for guiding fuzzers to explore code and identify bugs, and it has been a key factor in the success of greybox fuzzing. However, code coverage has a critical limitation: coverage-guided fuzzers can miss bugs even when the associated code is covered. This limitation arises because merely executing the associated code is often insufficient to trigger a bug; specific conditions are usually also required. These conditions are not fully captured by code coverage, which focuses only on whether the code was executed. To address this problem, we propose a new objective: value state coverage, an additional dimension in coverage metrics that is orthogonal to code coverage. Value state is a combination of the values assigned to program variables and the order of their assignment, and by measuring the coverage of value states, we can guide a fuzzer to explore the triggering conditions of bugs. We also introduce Data-Driven Fuzzing , a novel fuzzing technique that focuses on value state coverage, and utilizes security-related variables, mutation strategies, and extreme values captured at run-time to effectively discover bugs. We implemented our approach in a prototype fuzzer named YFuzz . YFuzz has found 12 bugs in programs included in the OSS-Fuzz project, including 4 assigned CVEs, indicating that our approach is effective in finding bugs.",

        "title": "RIoTFuzzer: Companion App Assisted Remote Fuzzing for Detecting Vulnerabilities in IoT Devices",
        "abstract": "Due to the diversity of architectures and peripherals of Internet of Things (IoT) systems, blackbox fuzzing stands out as a prime option for discovering vulnerabilities of IoT devices. Existing black-box fuzzing tools often rely on companion apps to generate valid fuzzing packets. However, existing methods encounter the challenges of bypassing the cloud server side validation when it comes to fuzz devices that rely on cloud-based communication. Moreover, they tend to concentrate their efforts on Java components within Android companion apps, limiting their effectiveness in assessing non-Java components such as JavaScript-based mini-apps. In this paper, we introduce a novel blackbox fuzzing method, named RIoT-Fuzzer, designed to remotely uncover vulnerabilities of IoT devices with the assistance of companion apps, particularly those powered by All-in-one Apps with the JavaScript-based mini-apps feature enabled. Our approach utilizes document-based control command extraction, hybrid analysis for mutation point identification and side-channel-guided fuzzing to effectively address the challenges of fuzzing IoT devices remotely. We apply RIoTFuzzer to 27 IoT devices on prominent platforms and discovered 11 vulnerabilities. All of them have been acknowledged by the corresponding vendors. 8 have been confirmed by the vendors and have been assigned 4 CVE IDs. Our experiment results also demonstrate that side-channel-guided fuzzing can significantly enhance the efficiency of fuzzing packets sent to IoT devices, with an average increase of 76.62% and a maximum increase of 362.62%.",

        "abstract": "React, a single-page application framework, has recently become popular among web developers due to its flexible and convenient management of web application states via a syntax extension to JavaScript, called JSX (JavaScript and XML). Despite its abundant functionalities, the security of React, especially vulnerability detection, still lags: many existing vulnerability detection works do not support JSX let alone React Data Flow introduced by React components. The only exception is CodeQL, which supports JSX syntax. However, CodeQL cannot properly track React Data Flow across different components for detecting vulnerabilities. In this paper, we design a novel framework, called ReactApp-Scan, which constructs a Component Graph (CoG) for tracking Re-actDataFlowand detectingvulnerabilitiesfollowingbothJavaScript and React data flows. Specifically, ReactAppScan relies on abstract interpretation to build such a component graph via tracking component lifecycles and then detects vulnerabilities via finding paths be-tween sources and sinks. Our evaluation shows that ReactAppScan detects 61 zero-day vulnerabilities in real-world React applications. We have responsibly reported all the vulnerabilities and so far six vulnerabilities have been fixed and two have been acknowledged.",

        "abstract": "Multi-party training frameworks for decision trees based on secure multi-party computation enable multiple parties to train high-performance models on distributed private data with privacy preservation. The training process essentially involves frequent dataset splitting according to the splitting criterion (e.g. Gini impurity). However, existing multi-party training frameworks for decision trees demonstrate communication inefficiency due to the following issues: (1) They suffer from huge communication overhead in securely splitting a dataset with continuous attributes. (2) They suffer from huge communication overhead due to performing almost all the computations on a large ring to accommodate the secure computations for the splitting criterion. In this paper, we are motivated to present an efficient three-party training framework, namely Ents, for decision trees by communication optimization. For the first issue, we present a series of training protocols based on the secure radix sort protocols to efficiently and securely split a dataset with continuous attributes. For the second issue, we propose an efficient share conversion protocol to convert shares between a small ring and a large ring to reduce the communication overhead incurred by performing almost all the computations on a large ring. Experimental results from eight widely used datasets show that Ents outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks by $5.5\\times \\sim 9.3\\times$ in communication sizes and $3.9\\times \\sim 5.3\\times$ in communication rounds. In terms of training time, Ents yields an improvement of $3.5\\times \\sim 6.7\\times$. To demonstrate its practicality, Ents requires less than three hours to securely train a decision tree on a widely used real-world dataset (Skin Segmentation) with more than 245,000 samples in the WAN setting.",

        "abstract": "Regular access to unpredictable and bias-resistant randomness is important for applications such as blockchains, voting, and secure distributed computing. Distributed random beacon protocols address this need by distributing trust across multiple nodes, with the majority of them assumed to be honest. Numerous applications across the blockchain space have led to the proposal of several distributed random beacon protocols, with some already implemented. However, many current random beacon systems rely on threshold cryptographic setups or exhibit high computational costs, while others expect the network to be partial or bounded synchronous. To overcome these limitations, we propose HashRand, a computation and communication-efficient asynchronous random beacon protocol that only demands secure hash and pairwise secure channels to generate beacons. HashRand has a per-node amortized communication complexity of O( \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc5b log ( \ud835\udc5b )) bits per beacon. The computational efficiency of HashRand is attributed to the two orders of magnitude lower time of a one-way Hash computation compared to discrete log exponentiation. Interestingly, besides reduced overhead, HashRand achieves Post-Quantum security by leveraging the secure Hash function against quantum adversaries, setting it apart from other random beacon protocols that use discrete log cryptography. In a geo-distributed testbed of \ud835\udc5b = 136 nodes, HashRand produces 78 beacons per minute, which is at least 5x higher than Spurt [IEEE S&P\u201922]. We also demonstrate the practical utility of HashRand by implementing a Post-Quantum secure Asynchronous SMR protocol, which has a response rate of over 135k transactions per second at a latency of 2 . 3 seconds over a WAN for \ud835\udc5b = 16 nodes.",

        "abstract": "Microarchitectural security verification of software has seen the emergence of two broad classes of approaches. The first uses non-interference-based semantic security properties which are verified for a given program and a given model of the hardware microarchitecture. The second is based on attack patterns , which, if found in a program execution, indicates the presence of an exploit. We observe that while the former uses a formal specification that can capture several gadget variants targeting the same vulnerability, it is limited by the scalability of verification. Patterns, while more scalable, must be currently constructed manually, as they are narrower in scope and sensitive to gadget-specific structure. This work develops a technique that, given a non-interference-based semantic security hyperproperty, automatically generates attack patterns up to a certain complexity parameter (called the skeleton size). Thus, we combine the advantages of both approaches: security can be specified by a hyperproperty that uniformly captures several gadget variants, while automatically generated patterns can be used for scalable verification. We implement our approach in a tool and demonstrate the ability to generate new patterns, (e.g., for SpectreV1, SpectreV4) and improved scalability using the generated patterns over hyperproperty-based verification.",

        "abstract": "Computer programs are not executed in isolation, but rather interact with the execution environment which drives the program behaviors. Software validation methods thus need to capture the effect of possibly complex environmental interactions. Program environments may come from files, databases, configurations, network sockets, human-user interactions, and more. Conventional approaches for environment capture in symbolic execution and model checking employ environment modeling, which involves manual effort. In this paper, we take a different approach based on an extension of greybox fuzzing. Given a program, we first record all observed environmental interactions at the kernel/user-mode boundary in the form of system calls. Next, we replay the program under the original recorded interactions, but this time with selective mutations applied, in order to get the effect of different program environments -- all without environment modeling. Via repeated (feedback-driven) mutations over a fuzzing campaign, we can search for program environments that induce crashing behaviors. Our EnvFuzz tool found 33 previously unknown bugs in well-known real-world protocol implementations and GUI applications. Many of these are security vulnerabilities and 16 CVEs were assigned.",

        "abstract": "Auditing the use of data in training machine-learning (ML) models is an increasingly pressing challenge, as myriad ML practitioners routinely leverage the effort of content creators to train models without their permission. In this paper, we propose a general method to audit an ML model for the use of a data-owner's data in training, without prior knowledge of the ML task for which the data might be used. Our method leverages any existing black-box membership inference method, together with a sequential hypothesis test of our own design, to detect data use with a quantifiable, tunable false-detection rate. We show the effectiveness of our proposed framework by applying it to audit data use in two types of ML models, namely image classifiers and foundation models.",

        "title": "PreCurious: How Innocent Pre-Trained Language Models Turn into Privacy Traps",
        "abstract": "The pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm has demonstrated its effectiveness and has become the standard approach for tailoring language models to various tasks. Currently, community-based platforms offer easy access to various pre-trained models, as anyone can publish without strict validation processes. However, a released pre-trained model can be a privacy trap for fine-tuning datasets if it is carefully designed. In this work, we propose PreCurious framework to reveal the new attack surface where the attacker releases the pre-trained model and gets a black-box access to the final fine-tuned model. PreCurious aims to escalate the general privacy risk of both membership inference and data extraction on the fine-tuning dataset. The key intuition behind PreCurious is to manipulate the memorization stage of the pre-trained model and guide fine-tuning with a seemingly legitimate configuration. While empirical and theoretical evidence suggests that parameter-efficient and differentially private fine-tuning techniques can defend against privacy attacks on a fine-tuned model, PreCurious demonstrates the possibility of breaking up this invulnerability in a stealthy manner compared to fine-tuning on a benign pre-trained model. While DP provides some mitigation for membership inference attack, by further leveraging a sanitized dataset, PreCurious demonstrates potential vulnerabilities for targeted data extraction even under differentially private tuning with a strict privacy budget e.g. $\\epsilon=0.05$. Thus, PreCurious raises warnings for users on the potential risks of downloading pre-trained models from unknown sources, relying solely on tutorials or common-sense defenses, and releasing sanitized datasets even after perfect scrubbing.",

        "title": "I Don't Know You, But I Can Catch You: Real-Time Defense against Diverse Adversarial Patches for Object Detectors",
        "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized the field of computer vision like object detection with their unparalleled performance. However, existing research has shown that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In the physical world, an adversary could exploit adversarial patches to implement a Hiding Attack (HA) which patches the target object to make it disappear from the detector, and an Appearing Attack (AA) which fools the detector into misclassifying the patch as a specific object. Recently, many defense methods for detectors have been proposed to mitigate the potential threats of adversarial patches. However, such methods still have limitations in generalization, robustness and efficiency. Most defenses are only effective against the HA, leaving the detector vulnerable to the AA. In this paper, we propose \\textit{NutNet}, an innovative model for detecting adversarial patches, with high generalization, robustness and efficiency. With experiments for six detectors including YOLOv2-v4, SSD, Faster RCNN and DETR on both digital and physical domains, the results show that our proposed method can effectively defend against both the HA and AA, with only 0.4\\% sacrifice of the clean performance. We compare NutNet with four baseline defense methods for detectors, and our method exhibits an average defense performance that is over 2.4 times and 4.7 times higher than existing approaches for HA and AA, respectively. In addition, NutNet only increases the inference time by 8\\%, which can meet the real-time requirements of the detection systems.
