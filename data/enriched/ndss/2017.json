The . All - text and , letting . Abstract\u2014Fuzzing is an effective software testing technique to find bugs . Given the size and complexity of real - world applications , modern fuzzers tend to be either scalable , but not effective in exploring bugs that lie deeper in the execution , or capable of penetrating deeper in the application , but not scalable . In this paper , we present an application - aware evolutionary fuzzing strategy that does not require any prior knowledge of the application or input format . In order to maximize coverage and explore deeper paths , we leverage control - and data - flow features based on static and dynamic analysis to infer fundamental prop - erties of the application . This enables much faster generation of interesting inputs compared to an application - agnostic approach . We implement our fuzzing strategy in VUzzer and evaluate it on three different datasets : DARPA Grand Challenge binaries (CGC) , a set of real - world applications (binary input parsers) , and the recently released LAVA dataset . On all of these datasets , VUzzer yields significantly better results than state - of - the - art fuzzers , by quickly finding several existing and new bugs .",

Our\u00a0construction also offers protection against timing-channel attacks,\u00a0which has not been previously considered in ORAM protocols.\u00a0We built and evaluated a full implementation of ObliviSync\u00a0that supports multiple simultaneous read-only clients and a\u00a0single concurrent read/write client whose edits automatically\u00a0and seamlessly propagate to the readers.

But with this surge in popularity comes increased risk to privacy as the technology makes it easy to spy on people in otherwise-private environments, such as an individual\u2019s home. An attacker can \ufb02y a drone over fences and walls in order to observe the inside of a house, without having physical access. Existing drone detection systems require specialist hardware and expensive deployment efforts; making them inaccessible to the general public. In this work we present a drone detection system that requires minimal prior con\ufb01guration and uses inexpensive commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware to detect drones that are carrying out privacy invasion attacks. We use a model of the attack structure to derive statistical metrics for movement and proximity, that are then applied to received communications between a drone and its controller. We tested our system in real world experiments with two popular consumer drone models mounting privacy invasion attacks using a range of \ufb02ight patterns. We were able to both detect the presence of a drone and identify which phase of the privacy attack was in progress. Even in our worst-case we detected an attack before the drone was within 48m of its target.",

In this measurement study, we present a complementary methodology relying only on publicly available data to capture and analyze targeted attacks with both greater scale and depth. In particular, we detect exploit documents uploaded over one year to a large anti-virus aggregator (VirusTotal) and then mine the social engineering information they embed to infer their likely targets and contextual information of the attacks. We identify attacks against two ethnic groups (Tibet and Uyghur) as well as 12 countries spanning America, Asia, and Europe. We then analyze the exploit documents dynamically in sandboxes to correlate and compare the exploited vulnerabilities and malware families targeting different groups. Finally, we use machine learning to infer the role of the uploaders of these documents to VirusTotal (i.e., attacker, targeted victim, or third-party), which enables their classification based only on their metadata, without any dynamic analysis. We make our datasets available to the academic community.",

Our evaluation shows that our approach can successfully identify 99.24% of users as opposed to 90.84% for state of the art on single-browser fingerprinting against the same dataset. Further, our approach can achieve higher uniqueness rate than the only cross-browser approach in the literature with similar stability.",

In this paper, we \npropose a new authentication scheme (MooneyAuth) that relies on \nimplicitly remembering the content of previously seen Mooney images. \nThese images are thresholded two-tone images derived from images \ncontaining single objects. Our scheme has two phases: In the enrollment \nphase, a user is presented with Mooney images, their corresponding \noriginal images, and labels. This creates an implicit link between the \nMooney image and the object in the user's memory that serves as the \nauthentication secret. In the authentication phase, the user has to \nlabel a set of Mooney images, a task that gets performed with \nsubstantially fewer mistakes if the images have been seen in the \nenrollment phase. We applied an information-theoretical approach to \ncompute the eligibility of the user, based on which images were labeled \ncorrectly. This new dynamic scoring is substantially better than \npreviously proposed static scoring by considering the surprisal of the \nobserved events.

            "abstract": "Privilege separation has long been considered as a fundamental principle in software design to mitigate the potential damage of a security attack. Much effort has been given to develop various privilege separation schemes where a monolithic OS or hypervisor is divided into two privilege domains where one domain is logically more privileged than the other even if both run at an identical processor privilege level. We say that privilege separation is intra-level if it is implemented for software of a certain privilege level without any involvement or assistance of more privileged software. In general, realizing intra-level privilege separation mandates developers to rely on certain security features of the underlying hardware. So far, such development efforts however have been much less focused on ARM architectures than on the Intel x86 family mainly because the architectural provision of ARM security features was relatively insufficient. Unlike on x86, as a result, there exists no full intra-level scheme that can be universally applied to any privilege level on ARM. However, as malware and attacks increase against virtually every level of privileged software including an OS, a hypervisor and even the highest privileged software armored by TrustZone, we have been motivated to develop a technique, named as Hilps, to realize true intra-level privilege separation in all these levels of privileged software on ARM. Pivotal to the success of Hilps is the support from a new hardware feature of ARM\u2019s latest 64-bit architecture, called TxSZ, which we manipulate to elastically adjust the accessible virtual address range for a program. In our experiments, we have applied Hilps to retrofit the core software mechanisms for privilege separation into existing system software and evaluated the performance of the resulting system. According to the experimental results, the system incurs on average just less than 1 % overhead; hence, we conclude that Hilps is quite promising for practical use in real deployments.",

            "abstract": "Mobile apps are notorious for collecting a wealth of private information from users. Despite significant effort from the research community in developing privacy leak detection tools based on data flow tracking inside the app or through network traffic analysis, it is still unclear whether apps and ad libraries can hide the fact that they are leaking private information. In fact, all existing analysis tools have limitations: data flow tracking suffers from imprecisions that cause false positives, as well as false negatives when the data flow from a source of private information to a network sink is interrupted; on the other hand, network traffic analysis cannot handle encryption or custom encoding. We propose a new approach to privacy leak detection that is not affected by such limitations, and it is also resilient to obfuscation techniques, such as encoding, formatting, encryption, or any other kind of transformation performed on private information before it is leaked. Our work is based on blackbox differential analysis, and it works in two steps: first, it establishes a baseline of the network behavior of an app; then, it modifies sources of private information, such as the device ID and location, and detects leaks by observing deviations in the resulting network traffic. The basic concept of black-box differential analysis is not novel, but, unfortunately, it is not practical enough to precisely analyze modern mobile apps. In fact, their network traffic contains many sources of non-determinism, such as random identifiers, timestamps, and server-assigned session identifiers, which, when not handled properly, cause too much noise to correlate output changes with input changes. The main contribution of this work is to make black-box differential analysis practical when applied to modern Android apps. In particular, we show that the network-based non-determinism can often be explained and eliminated, and it is thus possible to reliably use variations in the network traffic as a strong signal to detect privacy leaks. We implemented this approach in a tool, called AGRIGENTO, and we evaluated it on more than one thousand Android apps. Our evaluation shows that our approach works well in practice and outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques. We conclude our study by discussing several case studies that show how popular apps and ad libraries currently exfiltrate data by using complex combinations of encoding and encryption mechanisms that other approaches fail to detect. Our results show that these apps and libraries seem to deliberately hide their data leaks from current approaches and clearly demonstrate the need for an obfuscation-resilient approach such as ours.",

            "abstract": "Kernel exploits constitute a powerful attack class allowing attackers to gain full control over a system. Various kernel hardening solutions have been proposed or deployed in practice to protect the kernel against code injection (e.g., DEP) or code-reuse exploits (e.g., CFI). However, the security of all these hardening techniques relies heavily on the assumption that kernel page tables cannot be manipulated, e.g., by means of dataonly attacks. Ensuring kernel page tables integrity is not only essential for kernel security but also a challenging task in practice since existing solutions require hardware trust anchors, costly hypervisors, or inefficient integrity checks. In this paper, we first motivate the importance of protecting kernel page tables by presenting a data-only attack against page tables to bypass the recently released CFI-based (Linux) kernel hardening technique RAP. Thereafter, we present the design and implementation of PT-Rand, the first practical solution to protect kernel page tables that does not suffer from the mentioned deficiencies of previous proposals. PT-Rand randomizes the location of page tables and tackles a number of challenges to ensure that the location of page tables is not leaked. This effectively prevents the attacker from manipulating access permissions of code pages, thereby enabling secure enforcement of kernel exploit mitigation technologies such as CFI. We extensively evaluate our prototype implementation of PT-Rand for the current Linux kernel on the popular Linux distribution Debian and report a low overhead of 0.22% for common benchmarks. Moreover, we combine RAP with PT-Rand to protect RAP against data-only attacks on kernel page tables.",

Current\u00a0implementations of protocols with security against passive adversaries\u00a0generate and process data much faster than it can be\u00a0sent over the network, even with a single thread. This paper\u00a0introduces novel methods to further reduce the communication\u00a0bottleneck and round complexity of semi-honest secure two-party\u00a0computation. Our new methodology creates a trade-off between\u00a0communication and computation, and we show that the added\u00a0computing cost for each party is still feasible and practicable in\u00a0light of the new communication savings. We first improve communication\u00a0for Boolean circuits with 2-input gates by factor 1.9x\u00a0when evaluated with the protocol of Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson\u00a0(GMW). As a further step, we change the conventional Boolean\u00a0circuit representation from 2-input gates to multi-input/multioutput\u00a0lookup tables (LUTs) which can be programmed to realize\u00a0arbitrary functions. We construct two protocols for evaluating\u00a0LUTs offering a trade-off between online communication and\u00a0total communication. Our most efficient LUT-based protocol\u00a0reduces the communication and round complexity by a factor\u00a02-4x for several basic and complex operations. Our proposed\u00a0scheme results in a significant overall runtime decrease of up to\u00a0a factor of 3x on several benchmark functions.",

            "abstract": "WireGuard is a secure network tunnel, operating at layer 3, implemented as a kernel virtual network interface for Linux, which aims to replace both IPsec for most use cases, as well as popular user space and/or TLS-based solutions like OpenVPN, while being more secure, more performant, and easier to use. The virtual tunnel interface is based on a proposed fundamental principle of secure tunnels: an association between a peer public key and a tunnel source IP address. It uses a single round trip key exchange, based on NoiseIK, and handles all session creation transparently to the user using a novel timer state machine mechanism. Short pre-shared static keys\u2014Curve25519 points\u2014are used for mutual authentication in the style of OpenSSH. The protocol provides strong perfect forward secrecy in addition to a high degree of identity hiding. Transport speed is accomplished using ChaCha20Poly1305 authenticated-encryption for encapsulation of packets in UDP. An improved take on IP-binding cookies is used for mitigating denial of service attacks, improving greatly on IKEv2 and DTLS\u2019s cookie mechanisms to add encryption and authentication. The overall design allows for allocating no resources in response to received packets, and from a systems perspective, there are multiple interesting Linux implementation techniques for queues and parallelism. Finally, WireGuard can be simply implemented for Linux in less than 4,000 lines of code, making it easily audited and veri\ufb01ed.",

In principle, bounds check instrumentation eliminates the problem, but this introduces high overheads and is further hampered by limited compatibility against un-instrumented code. On 64-bit systems, low-fat pointers are a recent scheme for implementing ef\ufb01cient and compatible bounds checking by transparently encoding meta information within the native pointer representation itself. However, low-fat pointers are traditionally used for heap objects only, where the allocator has suf\ufb01cient control over object location necessary for the encoding. This is a problem for stack allocation, where there exist strong constraints regarding the location of stack objects that is apparently incompatible with the low-fat pointer approach. To address this problem, we present an extension of low-fat pointers to stack objects by using a collection of techniques, such as pointer mirroring and memory aliasing, thereby allowing stack objects to enjoy bounds error protection from instrumented code. Our extension is compatible with common special uses of the stack, such as alloca , setjmp and longjmp , exceptions, and multi-threading, which rely on direct manipulation of the stack pointer. Our experiments show that we successfully extend the advantages of the low-fat pointer encoding to stack objects. The end result is a competitive bounds checking instrumentation for the stack and heap with low memory and runtime overheads, and high compatibility with un-instrumented legacy code.",

            "abstract": "As HTTPS deployment grows, middlebox and antivirus products are increasingly intercepting TLS connections to retain visibility into network traffic. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on the prevalence and impact of HTTPS interception. First, we show that web servers can detect interception by identifying a mismatch between the HTTP User-Agent header and TLS client behavior. We characterize the TLS handshakes of major browsers and popular interception products, which we use to build a set of heuristics to detect interception and identify the responsible product. We deploy these heuristics at three large network providers: (1) Mozilla Firefox update servers, (2) a set of popular e-commerce sites, and (3) the Cloudflare content distribution network. We find more than an order of magnitude more interception than previously estimated and with dramatic impact on connection security. To understand why security suffers, we investigate popular middleboxes and clientside security software, finding that nearly all reduce connection security and many introduce severe vulnerabilities. Drawing on our measurements, we conclude with a discussion on recent proposals to safely monitor HTTPS and recommendations for the security community. I . I N T R O D U C T I O N When it comes to HTTPS, the security community is working at cross purposes. On the one hand, we are striving to harden and ubiquitously deploy HTTPS in order to provide strong endto-end connection security [5], [20], [22], [23], [34], [51]. At the same time, middlebox and antivirus products increasingly intercept (i.e., terminate and re-initiate) HTTPS connections in an attempt to detect and block malicious content that uses the protocol to avoid inspection [6], [12], [15], [27]. Previous work has found that some specific HTTPS interception products dramatically reduce connection security [7], [12], [58]; however, the broader security impact of such interception remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study of HTTPS interception in the wild, quantifying both its prevalence in traffic to major services and its effects on real-world security. We begin by introducing a novel technique for passively detecting HTTPS interception based on handshake characteristics. HTTPS interception products typically function as transparent proxies: they terminate the browser\u2019s TLS connection, inspect the HTTP plaintext, and relay the HTTP data over a new TLS connection to the destination server. We show that web servers can detect such interception by identifying a mismatch between the HTTP User-Agent header and the behavior of the TLS client. TLS implementations display varied support (and preference order) for cipher suites, extensions, elliptic curves, compression methods, and signature algorithms. We characterize these variations for major browsers and popular interception products in order to construct heuristics for detecting interception and identifying the responsible product. Next, we assess the prevalence and impact of HTTPS interception by applying our heuristics to nearly eight billion connection handshakes. In order to avoid the bias inherent in any single network vantage point, we analyzed connections for one week at three major Internet services: (1) Mozilla Firefox update servers, (2) a set of popular e-commerce websites, and (3) the Cloudflare content distribution network. These providers serve different types of content and populations of users, and we find differing rates of interception: 4.0% of Firefox update connections, 6.2% of e-commerce connections, and 10.9% of U.S. Cloudflare connections were intercepted. While these rates vary by vantage point, all are more than an order of magnitude higher than previous estimates [27], [46]. To quantify the real-world security impact of the observed interception, we establish a grading scale based on the TLS features advertised by each client. By applying the metric to unmodified browser handshakes and to the intercepted connections seen at each vantage point, we calculate the change in security for intercepted connections. While for some older clients, proxies increased connection security, these improvements were modest compared to the vulnerabilities introduced: 97% of Firefox, 32% of e-commerce, and 54% of Cloudflare connections that were intercepted became less secure. Alarmingly, not only did intercepted connections use weaker cryptographic algorithms, but 10\u201340% advertised support for known-broken ciphers that would allow an active man-in-the-middle attacker to later intercept, downgrade, and decrypt the connection. A large number of these severely broken connections were due to network-based middleboxes rather than client-side security software: 62% of middlebox connections were less secure and an astounding 58% had severe vulnerabilities enabling later interception. Finally, we attempt to understand why such a large number of intercepted connections are vulnerable by testing the security of a range of popular corporate middleboxes, antivirus products, and other software known to intercept TLS. The default settings for eleven of the twelve corporate middleboxes we evaluated expose connections to known attacks, and five introduce severe vulnerabilities (e.g., incorrectly validate certificates). Similarly, 18 of the 20 client-side security products we tested reduce Permission to freely reproduce all or part of this paper for noncommercial purposes is granted provided that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

In some cases, manufacturers attempted to customize libraries or re-implement TLS, introducing negligent vulnerabilities. In other cases, products shipped with libraries that were years out of date. Across the board, companies are struggling to correctly deploy the base TLS protocol, let alone implement modern HTTPS security features. Our results indicate that HTTPS interception has become startlingly widespread, and that interception products as a class have a dramatically negative impact on connection security. We hope that shedding light on this state of affairs will motivate improvements to existing products, advance work on recent proposals for safely intercepting HTTPS [26], [38], [44], [54], and prompt discussion on long-term solutions.

            "abstract": "\u2014In this work we present a systematic presentation attack against ECG biometrics. We demonstrate the attack\u2019s effectiveness using the Nymi Band, a wrist band that uses elec- trocardiography (ECG) as a biometric to authenticate the wearer. We instantiate the attack using a hardware-based Arbitrary Waveform Generator (AWG), an AWG software using a computer sound card, and the playback of ECG signals encoded as .wav \ufb01les using an off-the-shelf audio player. In two sets of experiments we collect data from a total of 41 participants using a variety of ECG monitors, including a medical monitor, a smartphone-based mobile monitor and the Nymi Band itself. We use the \ufb01rst dataset to understand the statistical differences in biometric features that arise from using different measurement devices and modes. Such differences are addressed through the automated derivation of so-called mapping functions, whose purpose is to transform ECG signals from any device in order to resemble the morphology of the signals recorded with the Nymi Band.Aspart of our second dataset, we enroll users into the Nymi Band and test whether data from any of our sources can be used for a signal injection attack. Using data collected directly on the Nymi Band we achieve a success rate of 81%. When only using data gathered on other devices, this rate decreases to 43% when using raw data, and 62% after applying the mapping function. While we demonstrate the attack on the Nymi Band, we expect other ECG-based authentication systems to most likely suffer from the same, fundamental weaknesses.",

To this end, this paper uniquely exploits passive monitoring and analysis of a newly deployed network telescope IP address space in a first attempt ever to build broad notions of real CPS maliciousness. Specifically, we approach this problem by inferring, investigating, characterizing and reporting large-scale probing activities that specifically target more than 20 diverse, heavily employed CPS protocols. To permit such analysis, we initially devise and evaluate a novel probabilistic model that aims at filtering noise that is embedded in network telescope traffic. Subsequently, we generate amalgamated statistics, inferences and insights characterizing such inferred scanning activities in terms of their probe types, the distribution of their sources and their packets\u2019 headers, among numerous others, in addition to examining and visualizing the co-occurrence patterns of such events. Further, we propose and empirically evaluate an innovative hybrid approach rooted in time-series analysis and context triggered piecewise hashing to infer, characterize and cluster orchestrated and well-coordinated probing activities targeting CPS protocols, which are generated from Internet-scale unsolicited sources. Our analysis and evaluations, which draw upon extensive network telescope data observed over a recent one month period, demonstrate a staggering 33 thousand probes towards ample of CPS protocols, the lack of interest in UDP-based CPS services, and the prevalence of probes towards the ICCP and Modbus protocols. Additionally, we infer a considerable 74% of CPS probes that were persistent throughout the entire analyzed period targeting prominent protocols such as DNP3 and BACnet. Further, we uncover close to 9 thousand large-scale, stealthy, previously undocumented orchestrated probing events targeting a number of such CPS protocols. We validate the various outcomes through cross-validations against publicly available threat repositories. We concur that the devised approaches, techniques, and methods provide a solid first step towards better comprehending real CPS unsolicited objectives and intents.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic loading is a core feature used on current systems to (i) enable modularity and reuse, (ii) reduce memory footprint by sharing code pages of libraries and executables among processes, and (iii) simplify update procedures by eliminating the need to recompile executables when a library is updated. The Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) is a generic specification that describes how executable programs are stitched together from object files produced from source code to libraries and executables. Programming languages allow fine-grained control over variables, including access and memory protections, so programmers may write defense mechanisms assuming that the permissions specified at the source and/or compiler level will hold at runtime. Unfortunately, information about memory protection is lost during compilation.\u00a0 We identify one case that has significant security implications: when instantiating a process, constant external variables that are referenced in executables are forcefully relocated to a writable memory segment without warning.\u00a0 The loader trades security for compatibility due to the lack of memory protection information on the relocated external variables. We call this new attack vector\u00a0CoReV for Copy Relocation Violation.\u00a0 An adversary may use a memory corruption vulnerability to modify such \u201cread-only\u201d constant variables like vtables, function pointers, format strings, and file names to bypass defenses (like FORTIFY_SOURCE or CFI) and to escalate privileges. We have studied all Ubuntu 16.04 LTS packages and found that out of 54,045 packages, 4,570 packages have unexpected copy relocations that change read-only permissions to read-write, presenting new avenues for attack. The attack surface is broad with 29,817 libraries exporting relocatable read-only variables. The set of 6,399 programs with actual copy relocation violations includes ftp servers, apt-get, and gettext. We discuss the cause, effects, and a set of possible mitigation strategies for the\u00a0CoReV attack vector.",

Our main contributions include the\u00a0following.We present the first study measuring ROV enforcement,\u00a0revealing disappointingly low adoption at the core of the Internet.\u00a0We show, in contrast, that without almost ubiquitous ROV\u00a0adoption by large ISPs significant security benefits cannot be\u00a0attained. We next expose a critical security vulnerability: about a\u00a0third of RPKI authorizations issued for IP prefixes do not protect\u00a0the prefix from hijacking attacks. We examine potential reasons\u00a0for scarce adoption of RPKI and ROV, including human error\u00a0in issuing RPKI certificates and inter-organization dependencies,\u00a0and present recommendations for addressing these challenges.",

Existing attacks against ASLR rely on software vulnerabilities and/or on repeated (and detectable) memory probing. In this paper, we show that neither is a hard requirement and that ASLR is fundamentally insecure on modern cachebased architectures, making ASLR and caching conflicting requirements (ASLR\u2295Cache, or simply AnC). To support this claim, we describe a new EVICT+TIME cache attack on the virtual address translation performed by the memory management unit (MMU) of modern processors. Our AnC attack relies on the property that the MMU\u2019s page-table walks result in caching page-table pages in the shared last-level cache (LLC). As a result, an attacker can derandomize virtual addresses of a victim\u2019s code and data by locating the cache lines that store the page-table entries used for address translation. Relying only on basic memory accesses allows AnC to be implemented in JavaScript without any specific instructions or software features. We show our JavaScript implementation can break code and heap ASLR in two major browsers running on the latest Linux operating system with 28 bits of entropy in 150 seconds. We further verify that the AnC attack is applicable to every modern architecture that we tried, including Intel, ARM and AMD. Mitigating this attack without naively disabling caches is hard, since it targets the low-level operations of the MMU. We conclude that ASLR is fundamentally flawed in sandboxed environments such as JavaScript and future defenses should not rely on randomized virtual addresses as a building block.",

            "abstract": "Previous attacks that link the sender and receiver of\u00a0traffic in the Tor network ( \u00a0 correlation attacks \u00a0 ) have generally\u00a0relied on analyzing traffic from TCP connections. The TCP\u00a0connections of a typical client application, however, are often\u00a0accompanied by DNS requests and responses. This additional\u00a0traffic presents more opportunities for correlation attacks. This\u00a0paper quantifies how DNS traffic can make Tor users more vulnerable\u00a0to correlation attacks. We investigate how incorporating\u00a0DNS traffic can make existing correlation attacks more powerful\u00a0and how DNS lookups can leak information to third parties\u00a0about anonymous communication. We (i) develop a method to\u00a0identify the DNS resolvers of Tor exit relays; (ii) develop a new\u00a0set of correlation attacks (DefecTor attacks) that incorporate DNS\u00a0traffic to improve precision; (iii) analyze the Internet-scale effects\u00a0of these new attacks on Tor users; and (iv) develop improved\u00a0methods to evaluate correlation attacks. First, we find that there\u00a0exist adversaries that can mount DefecTor attacks: for example,\u00a0Google \u00a0 s DNS resolver observes almost 40% of all DNS requests\u00a0exiting the Tor network. We also find that DNS requests often\u00a0traverse ASes that the corresponding TCP connections do not\u00a0transit, enabling additional ASes to gain information about Tor\u00a0users\u00a0 \u00a0 traffic. We then show that an adversary that can mount a\u00a0DefecTor attack can often determine the website that a Tor user\u00a0is visiting with perfect precision, particularly for less popular\u00a0websites where the set of DNS names associated with that website\u00a0may be unique to the site. We also use the Tor Path Simulator\u00a0(TorPS) in combination with traceroute data from vantage points\u00a0co-located with Tor exit relays to estimate the power of AS-level\u00a0adversaries that might mount DefecTor attacks in practice.",

TumbleBit\u2019s anonymity properties are similar to classic Chaumian eCash: no one, not even the Tumbler, can link a payment from its payer to its payee. Every payment made via TumbleBit is backed by bitcoins, and comes with a guarantee that Tumbler can neither violate anonymity, nor steal bitcoins, nor \u201cprint money\u201d by issuing payments to itself. We prove the security of TumbleBit using the real/ideal world paradigm and the random oracle model. Security follows from the standard RSA assumption and ECDSA unforgeability.

            "abstract": "The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has quickly evolved to a new appified era where third-party developers can write apps for IoT platforms using programming frameworks. Like other appified platforms, e.g., the smartphone platform, the permission system plays an important role in platform security. However, design flaws in current IoT platform permission models have been reported recently, exposing users to significant harm such as break-ins and theft. To solve these problems, a new access control model is needed for both current and future IoT platforms. In this paper, we propose ContexIoT, a context-based permission system for appified IoT platforms that provides contextual integrity by supporting fine-grained context identification for sensitive actions, and runtime prompts with rich context information to help users perform effective access control. Context definition in ContexIoT is at the inter-procedure control and data flow levels, that we show to be more comprehensive than previous context-based permission systems for the smartphone platform. ContexIoT is designed to be backward compatible and thus can be directly adopted by current IoT platforms. We prototype ContexIoT on the Samsung SmartThings platform, with an automatic app patching mechanism developed to support unmodified commodity SmartThings apps. To evaluate the system\u2019s effectiveness, we perform the first extensive study of possible attacks on appified IoT platforms by reproducing reported IoT attacks and constructing new IoT attacks based on smartphone malware classes. We categorize these attacks based on lifecycle and adversary techniques, and build the first taxonomized IoT attack app dataset. Evaluating ContexIoT on this dataset, we find that it can effectively distinguish the attack context for all the tested apps. The performance evaluation on 283 commodity IoT apps shows that the app patching adds nearly negligible delay to the event triggering latency, and the permission request frequency is far below the threshold that is considered to risk user habituation or annoyance.",

            "abstract": "How to choose a strong but still easily memorable password? An often recommended advice is to memorize a random sentence (the mnemonic) and to concatenate the words\u2019 initials: a so-called mnemonic password. The paper in hand analyzes the effectiveness of this advice\u2014in terms of the obtained password strength\u2014and sheds light on various related aspects. While it is infeasible to obtain a sufficiently large sample of human-chosen mnemonics, the password strength depends only on the distribution of certain character probabilities. We provide several pieces of evidence that these character probabilities are approximately the same for human-chosen mnemonics and sentences from a web crawl and exploit this connection for our analyses. The presented analyses are independent of cracking software, avoid privacy concerns, and allow full control over the details of how passwords are generated from sentences. In particular, the paper introduces the following original research contributions: (1) construction of one of the largest corpora of human-chosen mnemonics, (2) construction of two web sentence corpora from the 27.3 TB ClueWeb12 web crawl, (3) demonstration of the suitability of web sentences as substitutes for mnemonics in password strength analyses, (4) improved estimation of password probabilities by position-dependent language models, and (5) analysis of the obtained password strength using web sentence samples of different sentence complexity and using 18 generation rules for mnemonic password construction. Our findings include both expected and less expected results, among others: mnemonic passwords from lowercase letters only provide comparable strength to mnemonic passwords that exploit the 7-bit visible ASCII character set, less complex mnemonics reduce password strength in offline scenarios by less than expected, and longer mnemonic passwords provide more security in an offline but not necessarily in an online scenario. When compared to passwords generated by uniform sampling from a dictionary, distributions of mnemonic passwords can reach the same strength against offline attacks with less characters.",

            "abstract": "The growing commoditization of the underground economy has given rise to malware delivery networks, which charge fees for quickly delivering malware or unwanted software to a large number of hosts. To provide this service, a key method is the orchestration of silent delivery campaigns, which involve a group of downloaders that receive remote commands and that deliver their payloads without any user interaction. These campaigns have not been characterized systematically, unlike other aspects of malware delivery networks. Moreover, silent delivery campaigns can evade detection by relying on inconspicuous downloaders on the client side and on disposable domain names on the server side. We describe Beewolf, a system for detecting silent delivery campaigns from Internet-wide records of download events. The key observation behind our system is that the downloaders involved in these campaigns frequently retrieve payloads in lockstep. Beewolf identifies such locksteps in an unsupervised and deterministic manner. By exploiting novel techniques and empirical observations, Beewolf can operate on streaming data. We utilize Beewolf to study silent delivery campaigns at scale, on a data set of 33.3 million download events. This investigation yields novel findings, e.g. malware distributed through compromised software update channels, a substantial overlap between the delivery ecosystems for malware and unwanted software, and several types of business relationships within these ecosystems. Beewolf achieves over 92% true positives and fewer than 5% false positives. Moreover, Beewolf can detect suspicious downloaders a median of 165 days ahead of existing anti-virus products and payload-hosting domains a median of 196 days ahead of existing blacklists.",

            "abstract": "Malicious payload injection attacks have been a\u00a0serious threat to software for decades. Unfortunately, protection\u00a0against these attacks remains challenging due to the ever\u00a0increasing diversity and sophistication of payload injection and\u00a0triggering mechanisms used by adversaries. In this paper, we\u00a0develop A2C, a system that provides general protection against\u00a0payload injection attacks. A2C is based on the observation that\u00a0payloads are highly fragile and thus any mutation would likely\u00a0break their functionalities. Therefore, A2C mutates inputs from\u00a0untrusted sources. Malicious payloads that reside in these inputs\u00a0are hence mutated and broken. To assure that the program\u00a0continues to function correctly when benign inputs are provided,\u00a0A2C divides the state space into exploitable and post-exploitable\u00a0sub-spaces, where the latter is much larger than the former, and\u00a0decodes the mutated values only when they are transmitted from\u00a0the former to the latter. A2C does not rely on any knowledge of\u00a0malicious payloads or their injection and triggering mechanisms.\u00a0Hence, its protection is general. We evaluate A2C with 30 realworld\u00a0applications, including apache on a real-world work-load,\u00a0and our results show that A2C effectively prevents a variety of\u00a0payload injection attacks on these programs with reasonably low\u00a0overhead (6.94%).",

Prior studies have largely relied on ad hoc empirical methods to evaluate the security of various SDN elements from different perspectives. However, they have stopped short of converging on a systematic methodology or developing automated systems to rigorously test for security flaws in SDNs. Thus, conducting security assessments of new SDN software remains a non-replicable and unregimented process. This paper makes the case for automating and standardizing the vulnerability identification process in SDNs. As a first step, we developed a security assessment framework, DELTA, that reinstantiates published SDN attacks in diverse test environments. Next, we enhanced our tool with a protocol-aware fuzzing module to automatically discover new vulnerabilities. In our evaluation, DELTA successfully reproduced 20 known attack scenarios across diverse SDN controller environments and discovered seven novel SDN application mislead attacks.",

Unfortunately, vulnerabilities in the GSM (2G) network protocol enable the creation of fake base stations (FBSes) that are not authorized by network operators. Criminal gangs are using FBSes to directly attack users by sending spam and fraud SMS messages, even if the users have access to 3G/4G networks. In this paper, we present the design, deployment, and evolution of an FBS detection system called FBS-Radar, based on crowdsourced data of nearly 100M users. In particular, we evaluate five different metrics for identifying FBSes in the wild, and find that FBSes can be precisely identified without sacrificing user privacy. Additionally, we present a novel method for accurately geolocating FBSes while incurring negligible impact on end-user devices. Our system protects users from millions of spam and fraud SMS messages per day, and has helped the authorities arrest hundreds of FBS operators.",

We present new JIT spraying attacks against Google\u2019s V8 and Mozilla\u2019s SpiderMonkey JavaScript engines on ARM. The V8 attack is the first JIT spraying attack not to rely on instruction decoding ambiguity, and the SpiderMonkey attack uses the first ARM payload that executes unintended instructions derived from intended instruction bytes without resynchronizing to the intended instruction stream. We review the JIT spraying defenses proposed in the literature and their currently-deployed implementations and conclude that the current state of JIT spraying mitigation, which prioritizes low performance overhead, leaves many exploitable attacker options unchecked. We perform an empirical evaluation of mitigations with low but non-zero overhead in a unified framework and find that full, robust defense implementations of diversification defenses can effectively mitigate JIT spraying attacks in the literature as well as our new attacks with a combined average overhead of 4.56% on x86-64 and 4.88% on ARM32.",

The Gentry\u2019s pioneering work of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and successive works have opened a new vista for secure and practical cloud computing. In this paper, we consider performing statistical analysis on encrypted data. To improve the ef\ufb01ciency of the computations, we take advantage of the batched computation based on the Chinese-Remainder-Theorem. We propose two building blocks that work with FHE: a novel batch greater-than primitive, and matrix primitive for encrypted matrices. With these building blocks, we construct secure procedures and protocols for different types of statistics including the histogram (count), contingency table (with cell suppression) for categorical data; k -percentile for ordinal data; and principal component analysis and linear regression for numerical data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, we ran experiments in \ufb01ve real datasets. For instance, we can compute a contingency table with more than 50 cells from 4000 of data in just 5 minutes, and we can train a linear regression model with more than 40 k of data and dimension as high as 6 within 15 minutes. We show that the FHE is not as slow as commonly believed and it becomes feasible to perform a broad range of statistical analysis on thousands of encrypted data.",

            "abstract": "A common type of memory error in the Linux kernel is using uninitialized variables (uninitialized use). Uninitialized uses not only cause undefined behaviors but also impose a severe security risk if an attacker takes control of the uninitialized variables. However, reliably exploiting uninitialized uses on the kernel stack has been considered infeasible until now since the code executed prior to triggering the vulnerability must leave an attacker-controlled pattern on the stack. Therefore, uninitialized uses are largely overlooked and regarded as undefined behaviors, rather than security vulnerabilities. In particular, full memorysafety techniques (e.g., SoftBound+CETS) exclude uninitialized use as a prevention target, and widely used systems such as OpenSSL even use uninitialized memory as a randomness source. In this paper, we propose a fully automated targeted stackspraying approach for the Linux kernel that reliably facilitates the exploitation of uninitialized uses. Our targeted stack-spraying includes two techniques: (1) a deterministic stack spraying technique that suitably combines tailored symbolic execution and guided fuzzing to identify kernel inputs that user-mode programs can use to deterministically guide kernel code paths and thereby leave attacker-controlled data on the kernel stack, and (2) an exhaustive memory spraying technique that uses memory occupation and pollution to reliably control a large region of the kernel stack. We show that our targeted stack-spraying approach allows attackers to reliably control more than 91% of the Linux kernel stack, which, in combination with uninitialized-use vulnerabilities, suffices for a privilege escalation attack. As a countermeasure, we propose a compiler-based mechanism that initializes potentially unsafe pointer-type fields with almost no performance overhead. Our results show that uninitialized use is a severe attack vector that can be readily exploited with targeted stack-spraying, so future memory-safety techniques should consider it a prevention target, and systems should not use uninitialized memory as a randomness source.",

            "abstract": "In the past decade, we have come to rely on computers for various safety and security-critical tasks, such as securing our homes, operating our vehicles, and controlling our finances. To facilitate these tasks, chip manufacturers have begun including trusted execution environments (TEEs) in their processors, which enable critical code (e.g., cryptographic functions) to run in an isolated hardware environment that is protected from the traditional operating system (OS) and its applications. While code in the untrusted environment (e.g., Android or Linux) is forbidden from accessing any memory or state within the TEE, the code running in the TEE, by design, has unrestricted access to the memory of the untrusted OS and its applications. However, due to the isolation between these two environments, the TEE has very limited visibility into the untrusted environment\u2019s security mechanisms (e.g., kernel vs. application memory). In this paper, we introduce BOOMERANG, a class of vulnerabilities that arises due to this semantic separation between the TEE and the untrusted environment. These vulnerabilities permit untrusted user-level applications to read and write any memory location in the untrusted environment, including security-sensitive kernel memory, by leveraging the TEE\u2019s privileged position to perform the operations on its behalf. BOOMERANG can be used to steal sensitive data from other applications, bypass security checks, or even gain full control of the untrusted OS. To quantify the extent of this vulnerability, we developed an automated framework for detecting BOOMERANG bugs within the TEEs of popular mobile phones. Using this framework, we were able to confirm the existence of BOOMERANG on four different TEE platforms, affecting hundreds of millions of devices on the market today. Moreover, we confirmed that, in at least two instances, BOOMERANG could be leveraged to completely compromise the untrusted OS (i.e., Android). While the implications of these vulnerabilities are severe, defenses can be quickly implemented by vendors, and we are currently in contact with the affected TEE vendors to deploy adequate fixes. To this end, we evaluated the two most promising defense proposals and their inherent trade-offs. This analysis led the proposal of a novel BOOMERANG defense, addressing the major shortcomings of the existing defenses with minimal performance overhead. Our findings have been reported to and verified by the corresponding vendors, who are currently in the process of creating security patches.",

            "abstract": "Credit networks model transitive trust (or credit) between users in a distributed environment and have recently seen a rapid increase of popularity due to their flexible design and robustness against intrusion. They serve today as a backbone of real-world IOweYou transaction settlement networks such as Ripple and Stellar, which are deployed by various banks worldwide, as well as several other systems, such as spamresistant communication protocols and Sybil-tolerant social networks. Current solutions, however, raise serious privacy concerns, as the network topology as well as the credit value of the links are made public for apparent transparency purposes and any changes are logged. In payment scenarios, for instance, this means that all transactions have to be public and everybody knows who paid what to whom. In this work, we question the necessity of a privacy-invasive transaction ledger. In particular, we present SilentWhispers, the first distributed, privacy-preserving credit network that does not require any ledger to protect the integrity of transactions. Yet, SilentWhispers guarantees integrity and privacy of link values and transactions even in the presence of distrustful users and malicious neighbors, whose misbehavior in changing link values is detected and such users can be held accountable. We formalize these properties as ideal functionalities in the universal composability framework and present a secure realization based on a novel combination of secret-sharing-based multiparty computation and digital signature chains. SilentWhispers can handle network churn, and it is efficient as demonstrated with a prototype implementation evaluated using payments data extracted from the currently deployed Ripple payment system.",

However, conducting measurements on the live Tor network, if done improperly, can endanger the security and anonymity of the millions of users who depend on the network to enhance their online privacy. Indeed, several existing measurement studies of Tor have been heavily criticized for unsafe research practices. Tor needs privacy-preserving methods of gathering statistics. The recently proposed PrivEx system demonstrates how data can be safely collected on Tor using techniques from differential privacy. However, as we demonstrate in this paper, the integrity of the statistics reported by PrivEx is brittle under realistic deployment conditions. An adversary who operates even a single relay in the volunteer-operated anonymity network can arbitrarily influence the result of PrivEx queries. We argue that a safe and useful data collection mechanism must provide both privacy and integrity protections. This paper presents HisTor , a privacy-preserving statistics collection scheme based on ( , \u03b4)-differential privacy that is robust against adversarial manipulation. We formalize the security guarantees of HisTor and show using historical data from the Tor Project that HisTor provides useful data collection and reporting with low bandwidth and processing overheads.",

As both Android malware and the operating system itself constantly evolve, it is very challenging to design robust malware mitigation techniques that can operate for long periods of time without the need for modifications or costly re-training. In this paper, we present MaMaDroid, an Android malware detection system that relies on app behavior. MaMaDroid builds a behavioral model, in the form of a Markov chain, from the sequence of abstracted API calls performed by an app, and uses it to extract features and perform classification. By abstracting calls to their packages or families, MaMaDroid maintains resilience to API changes and keeps the feature set size manageable. We evaluate its accuracy on a dataset of 8.5K benign and 35.5K malicious apps collected over a period of six years, showing that it not only effectively detects malware (with up to 99% F-measure), but also that the model built by the system keeps its detection capabilities for long periods of time (on average, 86% and 75% F-measure, respectively, one and two years after training). Finally, we compare against DroidAPIMiner, a state-of-the-art system that relies on the frequency of API calls performed by apps, showing that MaMaDroid significantly outperforms it.",

Leveraging public data sources, and two known Tor issues, we perform the first systematic study on the security of the Tor bridges infrastructure. Our study covers both the public infrastructure available to all Tor users, and the previously unreported private infrastructure, comprising private nodes for the exclusive use of those who know their existence. Our analysis of the public infrastructure is twofold. First, we examine the security implications of the public data in the CollecTor service, identifying several pieces of data that may be detrimental for the security of bridges. Then, we measure security relevant properties of public bridges. Our results show that the 55% of public bridges that carry clients are vulnerable to aggressive blocking; that 90% of bridge clients use default bridges that are trivial to identify; that the concurrent deployment of Pluggable Transports in bridges reduces the security of the most secure transports; and that running non-Tor services in the same host as a bridge may harm its anonymity. To study the private infrastructure, we use an approach to discover 694 private bridges on the Internet and a novel technique to track bridges across IP changes. We are first to measure the size of the private bridge population (35% discovered bridges are private) and to report existence of infrastructures that use private proxies to forward traffic to backend bridges or relays. We use a novel clustering approach to analyze the different infrastructures using proxies and bridges, examining its hosting and security properties. We provide an extensive discussion on the security implications of our findings.",

            "abstract": "Covert channels evade isolation mechanisms between multiple parties in the cloud. Especially cache covert channels allow the transmission of several hundred kilobits per second between unprivileged user programs in separate virtual machines. However, caches are small and shared and thus cache-based communication is susceptible to noise from any system activity and interrupts. The feasibility of a reliable cache covert channel under a severe noise scenario has not been demonstrated yet. Instead, previous work relies on either of the two contradicting assumptions: the assumption of direct applicability of error-correcting codes, or the assumption that noise effectively prevents covert channels. In this paper, we show that both assumptions are wrong. First, error-correcting codes cannot be applied directly, due to the noise characteristics. Second, even with extraordinarily high system activity, we demonstrate an error-free and highthroughput covert channel. We provide the first comprehensive characterization of noise on cache covert channels due to cache activity and interrupts. We build the first robust covert channel based on established techniques from wireless transmission protocols, adapted for our use in microarchitectural attacks. Our errorcorrecting and error-handling high-throughput covert channel can sustain transmission rates of more than 45 KBps on Amazon EC2, which is 3 orders of magnitude higher than previous covert channels demonstrated on Amazon EC2. Our robust and errorfree channel even allows us to build an SSH connection between two virtual machines, where all existing covert channels fail.",

This results not only in undefined and generally undesired behavior, but is also a cause of information disclosure and other security vulnerabilities. Existing solutions for mitigating such errors are not used in practice as they are either limited in scope (for example, only protecting the heap), or incur high runtime overhead. In this paper, we propose SafeInit, a practical protection system which hardens applications against such undefined behavior by guaranteeing initialization of all values on the heap and stack, every time they are allocated or come into scope. Doing so provides comprehensive protection against this class of vulnerabilities in generic programs, including both information disclosure and re-use/logic vulnerabilities. We show that, with carefully designed compiler optimizations, our implementation achieves sufficiently low overhead (<5% for typical server applications and SPEC CPU2006) to serve as a standard hardening protection in practical settings. Moreover, we show that we can effortlessly apply it to harden non-standard code, such as the Linux kernel, with low runtime overhead.",

In this process, the victims are asked to provide scammers with remote access to their machines, who will then \"diagnose the problem\", before offering their support services which typically cost hundreds of dollars. Despite their conceptual simplicity, technical support scams are responsible for yearly losses of tens of millions of dollars from everyday users of the web. In this paper, we report on the first systematic study of technical support scams and the call centers hidden behind them. We identify malvertising as a major culprit for exposing users to technical support scams and use it to build an automated system capable of discovering, on a weekly basis, hundreds of phone numbers and domains operated by scammers. By allowing our system to run for more than 8 months we collect a large corpus of technical support scams and use it to provide insights on their prevalence, the abused infrastructure, the illicit profits, and the current evasion attempts of scammers. Finally, by setting up a controlled, IRB-approved, experiment where we interact with 60 different scammers, we experience first-hand their social engineering tactics, while collecting detailed statistics of the entire process. We explain how our findings can be used by law-enforcing agencies and propose technical and educational countermeasures for helping users avoid being victimized by technical support scams.",

However, well known results from the cryptographic literature have shown that software only virtual black box (VBB) obfuscation of general programs is impossible. In this paper we propose HOP, a system (with matching theoretic analysis) that achieves simulation-secure obfuscation for RAM programs, using secure hardware to circumvent previous impossibility results. To the best of our knowledge, HOP is the first implementation of a provably secure VBB obfuscation scheme in any model under any assumptions. HOP trusts only a hardware single-chip processor. We present a theoretical model for our complete hardware design and prove its security in the UC framework. Our goal is both provable security and practicality. To this end, our theoretic analysis accounts for all optimizations used in our practical design, including the use of a hardware Oblivious RAM (ORAM), hardware scratchpad memories, instruction scheduling techniques and context switching. We then detail a prototype hardware implementation of HOP. The complete design requires 72% of the area of a V7485t Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip. Evaluated on a variety of benchmarks, HOP achieves an overhead of 8X to 76X relative to an insecure system. Compared to all prior (not implemented) work that strives to achieve obfuscation, HOP improves performance by more than three orders of magnitude. We view this as an important step towards deploying obfuscation technology in practice.",

            "abstract": "Secure two-party computation (S2PC) allows two parties to compute a function on their joint inputs while leaking only the output of the function. At TCC 2009 Orlandi and Nielsen proposed the LEGO protocol for maliciously secure 2PC based on cut-and-choose of Yao\u2019s garbled circuits at the gate level and showed that this is asymptotically more efficient than on the circuit level. Since then the LEGO approach has been improved upon in several theoretical works, but never implemented. In this paper we describe further concrete improvements and provide the first implementation of a protocol from the LEGO family. Our protocol has a constant number of rounds and is optimized for the offline/online setting with function-independent preprocessing. We have benchmarked our prototype and find that our protocol can compete with all existing implementations and that it is often more efficient. As an example, in a LAN setting we can evaluate an AES-128 circuit with online latency down to 1.13ms, while if evaluating 128 AES-128 circuits in parallel the amortized cost is 0.09ms per AES-128. This online performance does not come at the price of offline inefficiency as we achieve comparable performance to previous, less general protocols, and significantly better if we ignore the cost of the function-independent preprocessing. Also, as our protocol has an optimal 2-round online phase it is significantly more efficient than previous protocols when considering a high latency network.

            "abstract": "Hidden sensitive operations (HSO) such as stealing privacy user data upon receiving an SMS message are increasingly utilized by mobile malware and other potentially-harmful apps (PHAs) to evade detection. Identification of such behaviors is hard, due to the challenge in triggering them during an app\u2019s runtime. Current static approaches rely on the trigger conditions or hidden behaviors known beforehand and therefore cannot capture previously unknown HSO activities. Also these techniques tend to be computationally intensive and therefore less suitable for analyzing a large number of apps. As a result, our understanding of real-world HSO today is still limited, not to mention effective means to mitigate this threat. In this paper, we present HSOMINER, an innovative machinelearning based program analysis technique that enables a largescale discovery of unknown HSO activities. Our approach leverages a set of program features that characterize an HSO branch and can be relatively easy to extract from an app. These features summarize a set of unique observations about an HSO condition, its paths and the relations between them, and are designed to be general for finding hidden suspicious behaviors. Particularly, we found that a trigger condition is less likely to relate to the path of its branch through data flows or shared resources, compared with a legitimate branch. Also, the behaviors exhibited by the two paths of an HSO branch tend to be conspicuously different (innocent on one side and sinister on the other). Most importantly, even though these individual features are not sufficiently accurate for capturing HSO on their own, collectively they are shown to be highly effective in identifying such behaviors. This differentiating power is harnessed by HSOMINER to classify Android apps, which achieves a high precision (>98%) and coverage (>94%), and is also efficient as discovered in our experiments. The new tool was further used in a measurement study involving 338,354 realworld apps, the largest one ever conducted on suspicious hidden operations. Our research brought to light the pervasiveness of HSO activities, which are present in 18.7% of the apps we analyzed, surprising trigger conditions (e.g., click on a certain region of a view) and behaviors (e.g., hiding operations in a dynamically generated receiver), which help better understand 1A branch, unless otherwise specified, refers to a branching structure, which contains a condition and multiple paths. the problem and contribute to more effective defense against this new threat to the mobile platform.",

Often the instantiations of OT require prohibitive communication and computation complexity. OT extension protocols are introduced to compute a very large number of OTs referred to as extended OTs at the cost of a small number of OTs referred to as seed OTs. \nWe present a fast OT extension protocol for small secrets in the active setting. Our protocol when used to produce 1-out-of-n OTs outperforms all the known actively secure OT extensions.

            "abstract": "Reverse engineering of binary executables is a difficult task which gets more involved by the way compilers translate high-level concepts used in paradigms such as objectoriented programming into native code, as it is the case for C++. Such code is harder to grasp than, e. g., traditional procedural code, since it is generally more verbose and adds complexity through features such as polymorphism or inheritance. Hence, a deep understanding of interactions between instantiated objects, their corresponding classes, and the connection between classes would vastly reduce the time it takes an analyst to understand the application. The growth in complexity in contemporary C++ applications only amplifies the effect. In this paper, we introduce Marx, an analysis framework to reconstruct class hierarchies of C++ programs and resolve virtual callsites. We have evaluated the results on a diverse set of large, real-world applications. Our experimental results show that our approach achieves a high precision (93.2% of the hierarchies reconstructed accurately for Node.js, 88.4% for MySQL Server) while keeping analysis times practical. Furthermore, we show that, despite any imprecision in the analysis, the derived information can be reliably used in classic software security hardening applications without breaking programs. We showcase this property for two applications built on top of the output of our framework: vtable protection and type-safe object reuse. This demonstrates that, in addition to traditional reverse engineering applications, Marx can aid in implementing concrete, valuable tools e. g., in the domain of exploit mitigations.",

            "abstract": "Android graphic user interface (GUI) system plays an important role in rendering app GUIs on display and interacting with users. However, the security of this critical subsystem remains under-investigated. In fact, Android GUI has been plagued by a variety of GUI attacks in recent years. GUI attack refers to any harmful behavior that attempts to adversely affect the integrity or availability of the GUIs belonging to other apps. These attacks are real threats and can cause severe consequences, such as sensitive user information leakage, user device denial of service, etc. Given the seriousness and rapid growth of GUI attacks, we are in a pressing need for a comprehensive defense solution. Nevertheless, existing defense methods fall short in defense coverage, effectiveness and practicality. To overcome these challenges, we systematically scrutinize the security implications of Android GUI system design and propose a new security model, Android Window Integrity (AWI), to comprehensively protect the system against GUI attacks. The AWI model defines the user session to be protected and the legitimacy of GUI system states in the unique mobile GUI environment. By doing so, it can protect a normal user session against arbitrary manipulation by attackers, and still preserve the original user experience. Our implementation, WindowGuard, enforces the AWI model and responds to a suspicious behavior by briefing the user about a security event and asking for the final decision from the user. This design not only improves the detection accuracy, but also makes WindowGuard more usable and practical to meet diverse user needs. WindowGuard is implemented as an Xposed module, making it practical to be quickly deployed on a large number of user devices. Our evaluation shows that WindowGuard can successfully detect all known GUI attacks, while yielding small impacts on user experience and system performance.",

            "abstract": "Memory corruption vulnerabilities not only allow modification of control data and injection of malicious payloads; they also allow adversaries to reconnoiter a diversified program, customize a payload, and ultimately bypass code randomization defenses. In response, researchers have proposed and built various leakage-resilient defenses against code reuse. Leakage-resilient defenses use memory protection techniques to prevent adversaries from directly reading code as well as pointer indirection or encryption techniques to decouple code pointers from the randomized code layout, avoiding indirect leakage. In this paper, we show that although current code pointer protections do prevent leakage per se, they are fundamentally unable to stop code reuse. Specifically, we demonstrate a new class of attacks we call address-oblivious code reuse that bypasses state-of-the-art leakage-resilience techniques by profiling and reusing protected code pointers, without leaking the code layout. We show that an attacker can accurately identify protected code pointers of interest and mount code-reuse attacks at the abstraction level of pointers without requiring any knowledge of code addresses. We analyze the prevalence of opportunities for such attacks in popular code bases and build three real-world exploits against Nginx and Apache to demonstrate their practicality. We analyze recently proposed leakage resilient defenses and show that they are vulnerable to address oblivious code reuse. Our findings indicate that because of the prevalence of code pointers in realistic programs and the fundamental need to expose them to \u201cread\u201d operations (even indirectly), diversity defenses face a fundamental design challenge in mitigating such attacks.

However, despite their strong\u00a0anonymity guarantees, none of them have been employed in\u00a0practice so far: Most protocols fail to simultaneously address\u00a0the crucial problems of slot collisions and disruption by malicious\u00a0peers, while the remaining ones handle f malicious peers\u00a0with O(f2) communication rounds. We conceptualize these P2P\u00a0anonymous communication protocols as P2P mixing, and present\u00a0a novel P2P mixing protocol, DiceMix, that needs only four\u00a0communication rounds in the best case, and 4 + 2f rounds\u00a0in the worst case with f malicious peers. As every individual\u00a0malicious peer can force a restart of a P2P mixing protocol by\u00a0simply omitting his messages, we find DiceMix with its worst-case\u00a0complexity of O(f) rounds to be an optimal P2P mixing solution.",

            "abstract": "\u2014Traditional execution environments deploy Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) to defend against memory corruption attacks. However, Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX), a new trusted execution environment designed to serve security-critical applications on the cloud, lacks such an effective, well-studied feature. In fact, we find that applying ASLR to SGX programs raises non-trivial issues beyond simple engineering for a number of reasons: 1) SGX is designed to defeat a stronger adversary than the traditional model, which requires the address space layout to be hidden from the kernel; 2) the limited memory uses in SGX programs present a new challenge in providing a sufficient degree of entropy; 3) remote attestation conflicts with the dynamic relocation required for ASLR; and 4) the SGX specification relies on known and fixed addresses for key data structures that cannot be randomized. This paper presents SGX-Shield, a new ASLR scheme designed for SGX environments. SGX-Shield is built on a secure in-enclave loader to secretly bootstrap the memory space layout with a finer-grained randomization. To be compatible with SGX hardware (e.g., remote attestation, fixed addresses), SGX-Shield is designed with a software-based data execution protection mechanism through an LLVM-based compiler. We implement SGX-Shield and thoroughly evaluate it on real SGX hardware. It shows a high degree of randomness in memory layouts and stops memory corruption attacks with a high probability. SGX-Shield shows 7.61% performance overhead in running common micro-benchmarks and 2.25% overhead in running a more realistic workload of an HTTPS server.",

Unfortunately, efficiently hardening hypervisors is challenging because they lack a privileged security monitor and decomposition strategies. In this work we systematically analyze the 191 Xen hypervisor vulnerabilities from Xen Security Advisories, revealing that the majority (144) are in the core hypervisor not Dom0. We then use the analysis to provide a novel deconstruction of Xen, called Nexen, into a security monitor, a shared service domain, and per-VM Xen slices that are isolated by a least-privileged sandboxing framework. We implement Nexen using the Nested Kernel architecture, efficiently nesting itself within the Xen address space, and extend the Nested Kernel design by adding services for arbitrarily many protection domains along with dynamic allocators, data isolation, and cross-domain control-flow integrity. The effect is that Nexen confines VM-based hypervisor compromises to single Xen VM instances, thwarts 74% (107/144) of known Xen vulnerabilities, and enforces Xen code integrity (defending against all code injection compromises) while observing negligible overhead (1.2% on average). Overall, we believe that Nexen is uniquely positioned to provide a fundamental need for hypervisor hardening at minimal performance and implementation costs.",

            "abstract": "Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is a\u00a0hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) that enables\u00a0secure execution of a program in an isolated environment,\u00a0called an enclave. SGX hardware protects the running enclave\u00a0against malicious software, including the operating system, hypervisor,\u00a0and even low-level firmware. This strong security property\u00a0allows trustworthy execution of programs in hostile environments,\u00a0such as a public cloud, without trusting anyone (e.g., a cloud\u00a0provider) between the enclave and the SGX hardware. However,\u00a0recent studies have demonstrated that enclave programs are\u00a0vulnerable to accurate controlled-channel attacks conducted by a\u00a0malicious OS. Since enclaves rely on the underlying OS, curious\u00a0and potentially malicious OSs can observe a sequence of accessed\u00a0addresses by intentionally triggering page faults. In this paper, we propose T-SGX, a complete mitigation\u00a0solution to the controlled-channel attack in terms of compatibility,\u00a0performance, and ease of use. T-SGX relies on a commodity\u00a0component of the Intel processor (since Haswell), called Transactional\u00a0Synchronization Extensions (TSX), which implements a\u00a0restricted form of hardware transactional memory. As TSX is\u00a0implemented as an extension (i.e., snooping the cache protocol),\u00a0any unusual event, such as an exception or interrupt, that should\u00a0be handled in its core component, results in an abort of the\u00a0ongoing transaction. One interesting property is that the TSX\u00a0abort suppresses the notification of errors to the underlying OS.\u00a0This means that the OS cannot know whether a page fault has\u00a0occurred during the transaction. T-SGX, by utilizing this property\u00a0of TSX, can carefully isolate the effect of attempts to tap running\u00a0enclaves, thereby completely eradicating the known controlled channel\u00a0attack. We have implemented T-SGX as a compiler-level scheme\u00a0to automatically transform a normal enclave program into a\u00a0secured enclave program without requiring manual source code\u00a0modification or annotation. We not only evaluate the security\u00a0properties of T-SGX, but also demonstrate that it could be\u00a0applied to all the previously demonstrated attack targets, such as\u00a0libjpeg, Hunspell, and FreeType. To evaluate the performance of\u00a0T-SGX, we ported 10 benchmark programs of nbench to the SGX\u00a0environment. Our evaluation results look promising. T-SGX is an order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art mitigation\u00a0schemes. On our benchmarks, T-SGX incurs on average 50%\u00a0performance overhead and less than 30% storage overhead.",

            "abstract": "Intel SGX, a new security capability in emerging CPUs, allows user-level application code to execute in hardware isolated enclaves. Enclave memory is isolated from all other software on the system, even from the privileged OS or hypervisor. While being a promising hardware-rooted building block, enclaves have severely limited capabilities, such as no native access to system calls and standard OS abstractions. These OS abstractions are used ubiquitously in real-world applications. In this paper, we present a new system called PANOPLY which bridges the gap between the SGX-native abstractions and the standard OS abstractions which feature-rich, commodity Linux applications require. PANOPLY provides a new abstraction called a micro-container (or a \u201cmicron\u201d), which is a unit of code and data isolated in SGX enclaves. Microns expose the standard POSIX abstractions to application logic, including access to filesystems, network, multi-threading, multi-processing and thread synchronization primitives. Further, PANOPLY enforces a strong integrity property for the inter-enclave interactions, ensuring that the execution of the application follows the legitimate control and data-flow even if the OS misbehaves. Thus, commodity Linux applications can enhance security by splitting their application logic in one or more microns, or by importing micron-libraries, with little effort. In contrast to previous systems that enable comparable richness, PANOPLY offers two orders of magnitude lower TCB (about 20 KLOC in total), more than half of which is boiler-plate and can be automatically verified in the future. We demonstrate how PANOPLY enables much stronger security in 4 real-world applications \u2014 including Tor, OpenSSL, and web services \u2014 which can base security on hardware-root of trust.",

            "abstract": "The multi-tenancy of a cloud usually leads to security concerns over network isolation around each cloud tenant's virtual resources. However, verifying network isolation in cloud virtual networks poses several unique challenges. The \nsheer size of virtual networks implies a prohibitive complexity, whereas the constant changes in virtual resources demand a short response time. To make things worse, such networks typically allow fine-grained (e.g., VM-level) and distributed (e.g., security groups) network access control. Those challenges can either invalidate existing approaches or cause an unacceptable delay which prevents runtime applications. In this thesis, we present TenantGuard, a scalable system for verifying cloud-wide, VM-level network isolation at runtime. We take advantage of the hierarchical nature of virtual networks, efficient data structures, incremental verification, and parallel computation to reduce the \nperformance overhead of security verification. We implement our approach based on OpenStack and evaluate its performance both in-house and on Amazon EC2, which confirms its scalability and efficiency (13 seconds for verifying 168 millions of VM pairs). We further integrate TenantGuard with Congress, an OpenStack \npolicy service, to verify the compliance of isolation results against \ntenant-specific high level security policies.",

            "abstract": "Static binary rewriting has many important applications in reverse engineering, such as patching, code reuse, and instrumentation. Binary reassembling is an efficient solution for static binary rewriting. While there has been a proposed solution to the reassembly of binaries, an evaluation on a realworld binary dataset shows that it suffers from some problems that lead to breaking binaries. Those problems include incorrect symbolization of immediates, failure in identifying symbolizable constants, lack of pointer safety checks, and other issues. Failure in addressing those problems makes the existing approach unsuitable for real-world binaries, especially those compiled with optimizations enabled. In this paper, we present a new systematic approach for binary reassembling. Our new approach is implemented in a tool called Ramblr. We evaluate Ramblr on 106 real-world programs on Linux x86 and x86-64, and 143 programs collected from the Cyber Grand Challenge Qualification Event. All programs are compiled to binaries with a set of different compilation flags in order to cover as many real-world scenarios as possible. Ramblr successfully reassembles most of the binaries, which is an improvement over the state-of-the-art approach. It should be noted that our reassembling procedure yields no execution overhead and no size expansion.",

However, a major bottleneck of such system is it requires continuous sampling of accelerometer, which reduces battery life of wearable sensors. In this paper, we present KEHGait, which advocates use of output voltage signal from kinetic energy harvester (KEH) as the source for gait recognition. KEHGait is motivated by the prospect of significant power saving by not having to sample the accelerometer at all. Indeed, our measurements show that, compared to conventional accelerometerbased gait detection, KEH-Gait can reduce energy consumption by 78.15%. The feasibility of KEH-Gait is based on the fact that human gait has distinctive movement patterns for different individuals, which is expected to leave distinctive patterns for KEH as well. We evaluate the performance of KEH-Gait using two different types of KEH hardware on a data set of 20 subjects. Our experiments demonstrate that, although KEH-Gait yields slightly lower accuracy than accelerometer-based gait detection when single step is used, the accuracy problem can be overcome by the proposed Multi-Step Sparse Representation Classification (MSSRC). We discuss the advantages and limitations of our approach in detail and give practical insights to the use of KEH in a real-world environment.",

It is believed that recommender systems recommend a user items (e.g., videos on YouTube, products on Amazon) that match the user\u2019s preference. In this work, we propose new attacks to recommender systems. Our attacks exploit fundamental vulnerabilities of recommender systems and can spoof a recommender system to make recommendations as an attacker desires. Our key idea is to inject fake co-visitations to the system. Given a bounded number of fake co-visitations that an attacker can inject, two key challenges are 1) which items the attacker should inject fake co-visitations to, and 2) how many fake co-visitations an attacker should inject to each item. We address these challenges via modelling our attacks as constrained linear optimization problems, by solving which the attacker can perform attacks with maximal threats. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our attacks via evaluations on both synthetic data and real-world recommender systems on several popular web services including YouTube, eBay, Amazon, Yelp, and LinkedIn. We also discuss strategies to mitigate our attacks.",

            "abstract": "The massive growth of transaction via third-party cashier has attracted numerous mobile apps to embed in-app payment functionality. Although this feature makes the payment easy within apps, transactions via current third-party in-app payment involve more sophisticated interactions between multiple participants compared to those using traditional payments. The implementations in mobile apps also lack security considerations. Therefore, such transaction exposes new attack vectors and could be exploited more easily, leading to serious deceptions such as payment forging. To investigate current third-party mobile payment ecosystem and find potential security threats, we conduct an in-depth analysis on world\u2019s largest mobile payment market\u2013China\u2019s mobile payment market. We study four mainstream third-party mobile payment cashiers, and conclude unified security rules that must be regulated by both cashier and merchant. We also illustrate the serious consequences of violating these security rules, which may cause up to four types of attacks against online and offline transactions. Besides, we detect the seven security rule violations to the payment in Android apps. Our detection result shows not only the prevalence of third-party in-app payment, but also the awful status quo of its security. Over 37% Android apps with at least 100,000 users embed third-party payment functionality. Hundreds of them violate security rule(s) and face with various potential security risks, allowing an attacker to consume almost every aspect of commodities or services in life without actually purchasing them or deceiving others to pay for them. Our further investigation reveals that the cashiers not only have improperly designed SDK, which may expand the attack effects, but also release ambiguous documents and even vulnerable sample codes, directly leading to the mistakes committed by merchants. Besides the cashiers\u2019 ignorance for security, our successful exploits to several apps show that these flawed implementations can cause financial loss in real world. We have reported these findings to all the related parties and received positive feedbacks.",

This paper presents a novel video-based attack to reconstruct Android lock patterns from video footage filmed using a mobile phone camera. Unlike prior attacks on pattern lock, our approach does not require the video to capture any content displayed on the screen. Instead, we employ a computer vision algorithm to track the fingertip movements to infer the pattern. Using the geometry information extracted from the tracked fingertip motions, our approach is able to accurately identify a small number of (often one) candidate patterns to be tested by an adversary. We thoroughly evaluated our approach using 120 unique patterns collected from 215 independent users, by applying it to reconstruct patterns from video footage filmed using smartphone cameras. Experimental results show that our approach can break over 95% of the patterns in five attempts before the device is automatically locked by the Android operating system. We discovered that, in contrast to many people\u2019s belief, complex patterns do not offer stronger protection under our attacking scenarios. This is demonstrated by the fact that we are able to break all but one complex patterns (with a 97.5% success rate) as opposed to 60% of the simple patterns in the first attempt. Since our threat model is common in day-to-day life, this paper calls for the community to revisit the risks of using Android pattern lock to protect sensitive information.",

            "abstract": "Location privacy continues to attract significant attentions in recent years, fueled by the rapid growth of locationbased services (LBSs) and smart mobile devices. Location obfuscation has been the dominating location privacy preserving approach, which transforms the exact location of a mobile user to a perturbed location before its public release. The notion of location privacy has evolved from user-defined location kanonymity to two statistical quantification based privacy notions: geo-indistinguishability and expected inference error. The former promotes differential location privacy but does not protect location against inference attacks of Bayesian adversary with using prior information, whereas the latter promotes the background inference resilient location privacy but does not guarantee differential location privacy with respect to geo-indistinguishability. In this paper we argue that geo-indistinguishability and expected inference error are two complementary notions for location privacy. We formally study the relationship between two privacy notions. By leveraging this relationship and a personalized error bound, we can effectively combine the two privacy notions. We develop PIVE, a two-phase dynamic differential location privacy framework. In Phase I, we take into account the user-defined inference error threshold and the prior knowledge about the user\u2019s location to determine a subset of locations as the protection location set for protecting the actual location by increasing adversary\u2019s expected location inference error. In Phase II, we generate pseudo-locations (i.e., perturbed locations) in the way that achieves differential privacy over the protection location set. This two-phase location obfuscation is constructed dynamically by leveraging the relationship between two privacy notions based on adversary\u2019s current prior information and user-specific privacy requirements on different locations and at different times. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate that our PIVE approach effectively guarantees the two privacy notions simultaneously and outperforms the existing mechanisms in terms of adaptive privacy protection in presence of skewed locations and computation efficiency.",

We argue that this is because existing enterprise security approaches fundamentally lack precision in one or more dimensions: (1) isolation to ensure that the enforcement mechanism does not induce interference across different principals; (2) context to customize policies for different devices; and (3) agility to rapidly change the security posture in response to events. To address these shortcomings, we present PSI, a new enterprise network security architecture that addresses these pain points. PSI enables fine-grained and dynamic security postures for different network devices. These are implemented in isolated enclaves and thus provides precise instrumentation on these above dimensions by construction. To this end, PSI leverages recent advances in software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV). We design expressive policy abstractions and scalable orchestration mechanisms to implement the security postures. We implement PSI using an industry-grade SDN controller (OpenDaylight) and integrate several commonly used enforcement tools (e.g., Snort, Bro, Squid). We show that PSI is scalable and is an enabler for new detection and prevention capabilities that would be difficult to realize with existing solutions.",

            "abstract": "Mobile apps have to satisfy various privacy requirements. App publishers are often obligated to provide a privacy policy and notify users of their apps\u2019 privacy practices. But how can we tell whether an app behaves as its policy promises? In this study we introduce a scalable system to help analyze and predict Android apps\u2019 compliance with privacy requirements. Our system is not only intended for regulators and privacy activists, but also meant to assist app publishers and app store owners in their internal assessments of privacy requirement compliance. Our analysis of 17,991 free apps shows the viability of combining machine learning-based privacy policy analysis with static code analysis of apps. Results suggest that 71% of apps that lack a privacy policy should have one. Also, for 9,050 apps that have a policy, we \ufb01nd many instances of potential inconsistencies between what the app policy seems to state and what the code of the app appears to do. Our results suggest that as many as 41% of these apps could be collecting location information and 17% could be sharing such with third parties without disclosing so in their policies. Overall, it appears that each app exhibits a mean of 1.83 inconsistencies.",
