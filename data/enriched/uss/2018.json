            "abstract": "Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks pose a severe threat to the availability of web applications. Traditionally, attackers have employed botnets or amplification techniques to send a significant amount of requests to exhaust a target web server's resources, and, consequently, prevent it from responding to legitimate requests. However, more recently, highly sophisticated DoS attacks have emerged, in which a single, carefully crafted request results in significant resource consumption and ties up a web application's back-end components for a non-negligible amount of time. Unfortunately, these attacks require only few requests to overwhelm an application, which makes them difficult to detect by state-of-the-art detection systems. \n \nIn this paper, we present RAMPART, which is a defense that protects web applications from sophisticated CPU-exhaustion DoS attacks. RAMPART detects and stops sophisticated CPU-exhaustion DoS attacks using statistical methods and function-level program profiling. Furthermore, it synthesizes and deploys filters to block subsequent attacks, and it adaptively updates them to minimize any potentially negative impact on legitimate users. \n \nWe implemented RAMPART as an extension to the PHP Zend engine. RAMPART has negligible performance overhead and it can be deployed for any PHP application without having to modify the application's source code. To evaluate RAMPART'S effectiveness and efficiency, we demonstrate that it protects two of the most popular web applications, WordPress and Drupal, from real-world and synthetic CPU-exhaustion DoS attacks, and we also show that RAMPART preserves web server performance with low false positive rate and low false negative rate.",

Training these networks is computationally expensive and requires vast amounts of training data. Selling such pre-trained models can, therefore, be a lucrative business model. Unfortunately, once the models are sold they can be easily copied and redistributed. To avoid this, a tracking mechanism to identify models as the intellectual property of a particular vendor is necessary.\n    \nIn this work, we present an approach for watermarking Deep Neural Networks in a black-box way. Our scheme works for general classification tasks and can easily be combined with current learning algorithms. We show experimentally that such a watermark has no noticeable impact on the primary task that the model is designed for and evaluate the robustness of our proposal against a multitude of practical attacks. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis, relating our approach to previous work on backdooring.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents the \ufb01rst side channel attack approach that, without relying on the cache organization and/or timing, retrieves the secret exponent from a single de-cryption on arbitrary ciphertext in a modern (current version of OpenSSL) \ufb01xed-window constant-time implementation of RSA. Speci\ufb01cally, the attack recovers the exponent\u2019s bits during modular exponentiation from analog signals that are unintentionally produced by the processor as it executes the constant-time code that constructs the value of each \u201cwindow\u201d in the exponent, rather than the signals that correspond to squaring/multiplication operations and/or cache behavior during multi-plicand table lookup operations. The approach is demonstrated using electromagnetic (EM) emanations on two mobile phones and an embedded system, and after only one decryption in a \ufb01xed-window RSA implementation it recovers enough bits of the secret exponents to enable very ef\ufb01cient (within seconds) reconstruction of the full private RSA key. Since the value of the ciphertext is irrelevant to our attack, the attack succeeds even when the ciphertext is unknown and/or when message randomization (blinding) is used. Our evaluation uses signals obtained by demodu-lating the signal from a relatively narrow band (40 MHz) around the processor\u2019s clock frequency (around 1GHz), which is within the capabilities of compact sub-$1,000 software-de\ufb01ned radio (SDR) receivers. Finally, we propose a mitigation where the bits of the exponent are only obtained from an exponent in integer-sized groups (tens of bits) rather than obtaining them one bit at a time. This mitigation is effective",

            "abstract": "Multimedia protocol tunneling enables the creation of covert channels by modulating data into the input of popular multimedia applications such as Skype. To be effective, protocol tunneling must be unobservable, i.e., an adversary should not be able to distinguish the streams that carry a covert channel from those that do not. However, existing multimedia protocol tunneling systems have been evaluated using ad hoc methods, which casts doubts on whether such systems are indeed secure, for instance, for censorship-resistant communication. In this paper, we conduct an experimental study of the unobservability properties of three state of the art systems: Facet, CovertCast, and DeltaShaper. Our work unveils that previous claims regarding the unobservability of the covert channels produced by those tools were \ufb02awed and that existing machine learning techniques, namely those based on decision trees, can uncover the vast majority of those channels while incurring in comparatively lower false positive rates. We also explore the application of semi-supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. Our \ufb01ndings suggest that the existence of manually labeled samples is a requirement for the successful detection of covert channels.",

            "abstract": "The Tor anonymity system provides online privacy for millions of users, but it is slower than typical web browsing.  To improve Tor performance, we propose PredicTor, a path selection technique that uses a Random Forest classifier trained on recent measurements of Tor to predict the performance of a proposed path. If the path is predicted to be fast, then the client builds a circuit using those relays. We implemented PredicTor in the Tor source code and show through live Tor experiments and Shadow simulations that PredicTor improves Tor network performance by 11% to 23% compared to Vanilla Tor and by 7% to 13% compared to the previous state-of-the-art scheme. Our experiments show that PredicTor is the first path selection algorithm to dynamically avoid highly congested nodes during times of high congestion and avoid long-distance paths during times of low congestion.  We evaluate the anonymity of PredicTor using standard entropy-based and time-to-first-compromise metrics, but these cannot capture the possibility of leakage due to the use of location in path selection. To better address this, we propose a new anonymity metric called CLASI: Client Autonomous System Inference. CLASI is the first anonymity metric in Tor that measures an adversary's ability to infer client Autonomous Systems (ASes) by fingerprinting circuits at the network, country, and relay level. We find that CLASI shows anonymity loss for location-aware path selection algorithms, where entropy-based metrics show little to no loss of anonymity. Additionally, CLASI indicates that PredicTor has similar sender AS leakage compared to the current Tor path selection algorithm due to PredicTor building circuits that are independent of client location.",

            "abstract": "We present an opportunistic study of the impact of a new password policy in a university with 100,000 staff and students. The goal of the IT staff who conceived the policy was to encourage stronger passwords by varying password lifetime according to password strength. Strength was measured through Shannon entropy (acknowledged to be a poor measure of password strength by the academic community, but still widely used in practice). When users change their password, a password meter informs them of the lifetime of their new password, which may vary from 100 days (50 bits of entropy) to 350 days (120 bits of entropy). \n \nWe analysed data of nearly 200,000 password changes and 115,000 resets of passwords that were forgotten/expired over a period of 14 months. The new policy took over 100 days to gain traction, but after that, average entropy rose steadily. After another 12 months, the average password lifetime increased from 146 days (63 bits) to 170 days (70 bits). \n \nWe also found that passwords with more than 300 days of lifetime are 4 times as likely to be reset as passwords of 100 days of lifetime. Users who reset their password more than once per year (27% of users) choose passwords with over 10 days fewer lifetime, and while they also respond to the policy, maintain this deficit. \n \nWe conclude that linking password lifetime to strength at the point of password creation is a viable strategy for encouraging users to choose stronger passwords (at least when measured by Shannon entropy).",

Previous research on SGX has demonstrated that memory corruption vulnerabilities within enclave code can be exploited to extract secret keys and bypass remote attestation. However, these attacks require kernel privileges, and rely on frequently probing enclave code which results in many enclave crashes. Further, they assume a constant, not randomized memory layout. \n \nIn this paper, we present novel exploitation techniques against SGX that do not require any enclave crashes and work in the presence of existing SGX randomization approaches such as SGX-Shield. A key contribution of our attacks is that they work under weak adversarial assumptions, e.g., not requiring kernel privileges. In fact, they can be applied to any enclave that is developed with the standard Intel SGX SDK on either Linux or Windows.",

Ironically, the mechanism CAs use to issue certificates is itself vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks by network-level adversaries. Autonomous Systems (ASes) can exploit vulnerabilities in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to hijack traffic destined to a victim\u2019s domain. In this paper, we rigorously analyze attacks that an adversary can use to obtain a bogus certificate. We perform the first real-world demonstration of BGP attacks to obtain bogus certificates from top CAs in an ethical manner. To assess the vulnerability of the PKI, we collect a dataset of 1.8 million certificates and find that an adversary would be capable of gaining a bogus certificate for the vast majority of domains. Finally, we propose and evaluate two countermeasures to secure the PKI: 1) CAs verifying domains from multiple vantage points to make it harder to launch a successful attack, and 2) a BGP monitoring system for CAs to detect suspicious BGP routes and delay certificate issuance to give network operators time to react to BGP attacks.",

            "abstract": "In 1998 Bleichenbacher presented an adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack on the RSA PKCS~#1~v1.5 padding scheme. The attack exploits the availability of a server which responds with different messages based on the ciphertext validity. This server is used as an oracle and allows the attacker to decrypt RSA ciphertexts. Given the importance of this attack, countermeasures were defined in TLS and other cryptographic standards using RSA PKCS~#1~v1.5. \nWe perform the first large-scale evaluation of Bleichenbacher's RSA vulnerability. We show that this vulnerability is still very prevalent in the Internet and affected almost a third of the top 100 domains in the Alexa Top 1 Million list, including Facebook and Paypal.\nWe identified vulnerable products from nine different vendors and open source projects, among them F5, Citrix, Radware, Palo Alto Networks, IBM, and Cisco. These implementations provide novel side-channels for constructing Bleichenbacher oracles: TCP resets, TCP timeouts, or duplicated alert messages. In order to prove the importance of this attack, we have demonstrated practical exploitation by signing a message with the private key of \\texttt{facebook.com}'s HTTPS certificate. Finally, we discuss countermeasures against Bleichenbacher attacks in TLS and recommend to deprecate the RSA encryption key exchange in TLS and the RSA PKCS~#1~v1.5 standard.",

            "abstract": "Mobile application security has been one of the major areas of security research in the last decade. Numerous application analysis tools have been proposed in response to malicious, curious, or vulnerable apps. However, existing tools, and specifically, static analysis tools, trade soundness of the analysis for precision and performance, and are hence soundy. Unfortunately, the specific unsound choices or flaws in the design of these tools are often not known or well-documented, leading to a misplaced confidence among researchers, developers, and users. This paper proposes the Mutation-based soundness evaluation (\u03bcSE) framework, which systematically evaluates Android static analysis tools to discover, document, and fix, flaws, by leveraging the well-founded practice of mutation analysis. We implement \u03bcSE as a semi-automated framework, and apply it to a set of prominent Android static analysis tools that detect private data leaks in apps. As the result of an in-depth analysis of one of the major tools, we discover 13 undocumented flaws. More importantly, we discover that all 13 flaws propagate to tools that inherit the flawed tool. We successfully fix one of the flaws in cooperation with the tool developers. Our results motivate the urgent need for systematic discovery and documentation of unsound choices in soundy tools, and demonstrate the opportunities in leveraging mutation testing in achieving this goal.",

            "abstract": "Bug bounties are a popular tool to help prevent software exploits. Yet, they lack rigorous principles for setting bounty amounts and require high payments to attract economically rational hackers. Rather than claim bounties for serious bugs, hackers often sell or exploit them. We present the Hydra Framework, the first general, principled approach to modeling and administering bug bounties that incentivize bug disclosure. Our key idea is an exploit gap, a program transformation that enables runtime detection, and rewarding, of critical bugs. Our framework transforms programs via N-of-N-version programming, a variant of classical N-version programming that runs multiple independent program instances. We apply the Hydra Framework to smart contracts, small programs that execute on blockchains. We show how Hydra contracts greatly amplify the power of bounties to incentivize bug disclosure by economically rational adversaries, establishing the first framework for rigorous economic evaluation of smart contract security. We also model powerful adversaries capable of bug withholding, exploiting race conditions in blockchains to claim bounties before honest users can. We present Submarine Commitments, a countermeasure of independent interest that conceals transactions on blockchains. We design a simple, automated Hydra Framework for Ethereum (ethereum.org) and implement two Hydra contracts, an ERC20 standard token and a Monty-Hall game. We evaluate our implementation for completeness and soundness with the official Ethereum Virtual Machine test suite and live blockchain data.",

            "abstract": "Operating systems provide various inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms. Software applications typically use IPC for communication between frontend and backend components, which run in different processes on the same computer. This paper studies the security of how the IPC mechanisms are used in PC, Mac and Linux software. We describe attacks where a nonprivi-leged process impersonates the IPC communication end-points. The attacks are closely related to impersonation and man-in-the-middle attacks on computer networks but take place inside one computer. The vulnerable IPC methods are ones where a server process binds to a name or address and waits for client communication. Our re-sults show that application developers are often unaware of the risks and secure practices in using IPC. We \ufb01nd attacks against several security-critical applications including password managers and hardware tokens, in which another user\u2019s process is able to steal and misuse sensitive data such as the victim\u2019s credentials. The vulnerabilities can be exploited in enterprise environments with centralized access control that gives multiple users remote or local login access to the same host. Computers with guest accounts and shared computers at home are similarly vulnerable.",

A long track of research papers, and increasingly also real-world industry applications, take advantage of the strong hardware-enforced confidentiality and integrity guarantees provided by Intel SGX. Ultimately, enclaved execution holds the compelling potential of securely offloading sensitive computations to untrusted remote platforms. \n \nWe present Foreshadow, a practical software-only microarchitectural attack that decisively dismantles the security objectives of current SGX implementations. Crucially, unlike previous SGX attacks, we do not make any assumptions on the victim enclave's code and do not necessarily require kernel-level access. At its core, Foreshadow abuses a speculative execution bug in modern Intel processors, on top of which we develop a novel exploitation methodology to reliably leak plaintext enclave secrets from the CPU cache. We demonstrate our attacks by extracting full cryptographic keys from Intel's vetted architectural enclaves, and validate their correctness by launching rogue production enclaves and forging arbitrary local and remote attestation responses. The extracted remote attestation keys affect millions of devices.",

The GDPR refers to these categories as sensitive personal data. This paper quanti\ufb01es the portion of Facebook users in the European Union (EU) who were labeled with interests linked to potentially sensitive personal data in the period prior to when GDPR went into effect. The results of our study suggest that Facebook labels 73% EU users with potential sensitive interests. This corresponds to 40% of the overall EU population. We also estimate that a malicious third party could unveil the identity of Facebook users that have been assigned a potentially sensitive interest at a cost as low as e 0.015 per user. Finally, we propose and implement a web browser extension to inform Facebook users of the potentially sensitive interests Facebook has assigned them.",

We discuss concrete examples of attacks which can be prevented by WPSE on OAuth 2.0 and SAML 2.0, including a novel attack on the Google implementation of SAML 2.0 which we discovered by formalizing the protocol specification in WPSE. Moreover, we use WPSE to carry out an extensive experimental evaluation of OAuth 2.0 in the wild. Out of 90 tested websites, we identify security flaws in 55 websites (61.1%), including new critical vulnerabilities introduced by tracking libraries such as Facebook Pixel, all of which fixable by WPSE. Finally, we show that WPSE works flawlessly on 83 websites (92.2%), with the 7 compatibility issues being caused by custom implementations deviating from the OAuth 2.0 specification, one of which introducing a critical vulnerability.",

            "abstract": "Broadly defined as the Internet of Things (IoT), the growth of commodity devices that integrate physical processes with digital connectivity has had profound effects on society--smart homes, personal monitoring devices, enhanced manufacturing and other IoT applications have changed the way we live, play, and work. Yet extant IoT platforms provide few means of evaluating the use (and potential avenues for misuse) of sensitive information. Thus, consumers and organizations have little information to assess the security and privacy risks these devices present. In this paper, we present SainT, a static taint analysis tool for IoT applications. SainT operates in three phases; (a) translation of platform-specific IoT source code into an intermediate representation (IR), (b) identifying sensitive sources and sinks, and (c) performing static analysis to identify sensitive data flows. We evaluate SainT on 230 SmartThings market apps and find 138 (60%) include sensitive data flows. In addition, we demonstrate SainT on IoTBench, a novel open-source test suite containing 19 apps with 27 unique data leaks. Through this effort, we introduce a rigorously grounded framework for evaluating the use of sensitive information in IoT apps---and therein provide developers, markets, and consumers a means of identifying potential threats to security and privacy.",

            "abstract": "The use of hidden communication methods by malware families skyrocketed in the last two years. Ransomware like Locky, Cerber or CryLocker, but also banking trojans like Zberp or ZeusVM, use image files to hide their tracks. Additionally, malware employed for targeted attacks has been using similar techniques for many years. The DuQu and Hammertoss families, for instance, use the popular JPEG file format to clandestinely exchange messages. Using these techniques, they easily bypass systems designed to protect sensitive networks against them. In this paper, we show that these methods result in structural changes to the respective files. Thus, infections with these malware families can be detected by identifying image files with an unusual structure. We developed a structural anomaly detection approach that is based on this insight. In our evaluation, SAD THUG achieves a mean true positive ratio of 99.24% for JPEG files using 10 different embedding methods while maintaining a mean true negative ratio of 99.323%. For PNG files, the latter number drops slightly to 98.88% but the mean true positive ratio improves to 99.318%. We only rely on the fact that these methods change the structure of their cover file. Thus, as we show in this paper, our approach is not limited to detecting a particular set of malware information hiding methods but can detect virtually any method that changes the structure of a container file.",

            "abstract": "The default Same Origin Policy essentially restricts access of cross-origin network resources to be \u201cwrite-only\u201d. However, many web applications require \u201cread\u201d access to contents from a different origin, so developers have come up with workarounds, such as JSON-P, to bypass the default Same Origin Policy restriction. Such ad-hoc workarounds leave a number of inherent security issues. CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) is a more disciplined mechanism supported by all web browsers to handle cross-origin network accesses. This paper presents our empirical study about the real-world uses of CORS. We find that the design, implementation, and deployment of CORS are subject to a number of new security issues: 1) CORS relaxes the cross-origin \u201cwrite\u201d privilege in a number of subtle ways that are problematic in practice; 2) CORS brings new forms of risky trust dependencies into web interactions; 3) CORS is generally not well understood by developers, possibly due to its inexpressive policy and its complex and subtle interactions with other web mechanisms, leading to various misconfigurations. Finally, we propose protocol simplifications and clarifications to mitigate the security problems uncovered in our study. Some of our proposals have been adopted by both CORS specification and major browsers.",

Previous TCP injection attacks stem from software vulnerabilities which can be easily eliminated via software update, but the side channel we report is rooted in the fundamental design of IEEE 802.11 protocols. This design flaw means it is impossible to eliminate the side channel without substantial changes to the specification. By studying the TCP stacks of modern operating systems and their potential interactions with the side channel, we can construct reliable and practical off-path TCP injection attacks against the latest versions of all three major operating systems (macOS, Windows, and Linux). Our attack only requires a device connected to the Internet via a wireless router, and be reachable from an attack server (e.g., indirectly so by accessing to a malicious website). Among possible attacks scenarios, such as inferring the presence of connections and counting exchanged bytes, we demonstrate a particular threat where an off-path attacker can poison the web cache of an unsuspecting user within minutes (as fast as 30 seconds) under realistic network conditions.",

A range of different security properties have been suggested for distance bounding protocols; we show how these can be encoded in our model and prove a partial order between them.

In doing so, we identify a new property, which we call uncompromised distance bounding , that captures the attacker model for protecting devices such as contactless payment cards or car entry systems, which assumes that the prover being tested has not been compromised, though other provers may have been. We show how to compile our new calculus into the applied pi-calculus so that protocols can be automatically checked with the ProVerif tool and we use this to analyse distance bounding protocols from Master-Card and NXP.",

Many of these \u201cthings\u201d are vulnerable baremetal embedded systems where the application executes directly on hardware without an operating system. Unfortunately, the integrity of current systems may be compromised by a single vulnerability, as recently shown by Google\u2019s P0 team against Broadcom\u2019s WiFi SoC. We present ACES (Automatic Compartments for Embedded Systems)1, an LLVM-based compiler that automatically infers and enforces inter-component isolation on bare-metal systems, thus applying the principle of least privileges. ACES takes a developer-specified compartmentalization policy and then automatically creates an instrumented binary that isolates compartments at runtime, while handling the hardware limitations of baremetal embedded devices. We demonstrate ACES\u2019 ability to implement arbitrary compartmentalization policies by implementing three policies and comparing the compartment isolation, runtime overhead, and memory overhead. Our results show that ACES\u2019 compartments can have low runtime overheads (13% on our largest test application), while using 59% less Flash, and 84% less RAM than the Mbed \u03bcVisor\u2014the current state-of-theart compartmentalization technique for bare-metal systems. ACES \u2018 compartments protect the integrity of privileged data, provide control-flow integrity between compartments, and reduce exposure to ROP attacks by 94.3% compared to \u03bcVisor.",

            "abstract": "Connected embedded systems are becoming widely deployed, and their security is a serious concern. Current techniques for security testing of embedded software rely either on source code or on binaries. Detecting vulnerabilities by testing binary code is harder, because source code semantics are lost. Unfortunately, in embedded systems, high-level source code (C/C++) is often mixed with hand-written assembly, which cannot be directly handled by current source-based tools. \n \nIn this paper we introduce Inception, a framework to perform security testing of complete real-world embedded firmware. Inception introduces novel techniques for symbolic execution in embedded systems. In particular, Inception Translator generates and merges LLVM bitcode from high-level source code, hand-written assembly, binary libraries, and part of the processor hardware behavior. This design reduces differences with real execution as well as the manual effort. The source code semantics are preserved, improving the effectiveness of security checks. Inception Symbolic Virtual Machine, based on KLEE, performs symbolic execution, using several strategies to handle different levels of memory abstractions, interaction with peripherals, and interrupts. Finally, the Inception Debugger is a high-performance JTAG debugger which performs redirection of memory accesses to the real hardware. \n \nWe first validate our implementation using 53000 tests comparing Inception's execution to concrete execution on an Arm Cortex-M3 chip. We then show Inception's advantages on a benchmark made of 1624 synthetic vulnerable programs, four real-world open source and industrial applications, and 19 demos. We discovered eight crashes and two previously unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating the effectiveness of Inception as a tool to assist embedded device firmware testing.",

Though the EDA scales well, it comes with an inherent risk: the Event Handler Poisoning (EHP) Denial of Service attack. When an EDA-based server multiplexes many clients onto few threads, a blocked thread (EHP) renders the server unresponsive. EHP attacks are a serious threat, with hundreds of vulnerabilities already reported in the wild. We make three contributions against EHP attacks. First, we describe EHP attacks, and show that they are a common form of vulnerability in the largest EDA community, the Node.js ecosystem. Second, we design a defense against EHP attacks, first-class timeouts, which incorporates timeouts at the EDA framework level. Our Node.cure prototype defends Node.js applications against all known EHP attacks with overheads between 0% and 24% on real applications. Third, we promote EHP awareness in the Node.js community. We analyzed Node.js for vulnerable APIs and documented or corrected them, and our guide on avoiding EHP attacks is available on nodejs.org.",

Their monolithic design gives successful attackers complete access to all application data and system resources. Shielding systems such as InkTag, Haven, and Virtual Ghost protect sensitive application data from compromised OS kernels. However, such systems are still vulnerable to side-channel attacks. Worse yet, compromised OS kernels can leverage their control over privileged hardware state to exacerbate existing side channels; recent work has shown that a compromised OS kernel can steal entire documents via side channels. This paper presents defenses against page table and last-level cache (LLC) side-channel attacks launched by a compromised OS kernel. Our page table defenses restrict the OS kernel\u2019s ability to read and write page table pages and defend against page allocation attacks, and our LLC defenses utilize the Intel Cache Allocation Technology along with memory isolation primitives. We prototype our solution in a system we call Apparition, building on an optimized version of Virtual Ghost. Our evaluation shows that our side-channel defenses add 1% to 18% (with up to 86% for one application) overhead to the optimized Virtual Ghost (relative to the native kernel) on real-world applications.",

            "abstract": "Heap metadata attacks have become one of the primary ways in which attackers exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities. While heap implementation developers have introduced mitigations to prevent and detect corruption, it is still possible for attackers to work around them. In part, this is because these mitigations are created and evaluated without a principled foundation, resulting, in many cases, in complex, inefficient, and ineffective attempts at heap metadata defenses. In this paper, we present HEAPHOPPER, an automated approach, based on model checking and symbolic execution, to analyze the exploitability of heap implementations in the presence of memory corruption. Using HEAPHOPPER, we were able to perform a systematic analysis of different, widely used heap implementations, finding surprising weaknesses in them. Our results show, for instance, how a newly introduced caching mechanism in ptmalloc (the heap allocator implementation used by most of the Linux distributions) significantly weakens its security. Moreover, HEAPHOPPER guided us in implementing and evaluating improvements to the security of ptmalloc, replacing an ineffective recent attempt at the mitigation of a specific form of heap metadata corruption with an effective defense.",

            "abstract": "IPsec enables cryptographic protection of IP packets. It is commonly used to build VPNs (Virtual Private Networks). For key establishment, the IKE (Internet Key Exchange) protocol is used. IKE exists in two versions, each with different modes, different phases, several authentication methods, and con\ufb01guration options. In this paper, we show that reusing a key pair across different versions and modes of IKE can lead to cross-protocol authentication bypasses, enabling the imperson-ation of a victim host or network by attackers. We exploit a Bleichenbacher oracle in an IKEv1 mode, where RSA encrypted nonces are used for authentication. Using this exploit, we break these RSA encryption based modes, and in addition break RSA signature based authentication in both IKEv1 and IKEv2. Additionally, we describe an of\ufb02ine dictionary attack against the PSK (Pre-Shared Key) based IKE modes, thus covering all available authentication mechanisms of IKE. We found Bleichenbacher oracles in the IKEv1 implementations of Cisco (CVE-2018-0131), Huawei (CVE-2017-17305), Clavister (CVE-2018-8753), and ZyXEL (CVE-2018-9129).

The discovery of IoT devices is the pre-requisite to characterize, monitor, and protect these devices. However, manual device annotation impedes a large-scale discovery, and the device classi\ufb01cation based on machine learning requires large training data with labels. Therefore, automatic device discovery and annotation in large-scale remains an open problem in IoT. In this paper, we propose an Acquisitional Rule-based Engine (ARE), which can automatically generate rules for discovering and annotating IoT devices without any training data. ARE builds device rules by leveraging application-layer response data from IoT devices and product descriptions in relevant websites for device annotations. We de\ufb01ne a transaction as a mapping between a unique response to a product description. To collect the transaction set, ARE extracts relevant terms in the response data as the search queries for crawling websites. ARE uses the association algorithm to generate rules of IoT device annotations in the form of (type, vendor, and product). We conduct experiments and three applications to validate the effectiveness of ARE.",

As a response to these nefarious consequences, various countermeasures have been developed in the form of browser extensions or even protection mechanisms that are built directly into the browser. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of these defense mechanisms by leveraging a framework that automatically evaluates the enforcement of the policies imposed to third-party requests. By applying our framework, which generates a comprehensive set of test cases covering various web mechanisms, we identify several \ufb02aws in the policy implementations of the 7 browsers and 46 browser extensions that were evaluated. We \ufb01nd that even built-in protection mechanisms can be circum-vented by multiple novel techniques we discover. Based on these results, we argue that our proposed framework is a much-needed tool to detect bypasses and evaluate solutions to the exposed leaks. Finally, we analyze the origin of the identi\ufb01ed bypass techniques, and \ufb01nd that these are due to a variety of implementation, con\ufb01guration and design \ufb02aws.",

            "abstract": "The US federal court system is exploring ways to improve\nthe accountability of electronic surveillance, an\nopaque process often involving cases sealed from public\nview and tech companies subject to gag orders against\ninforming surveilled users. One judge has proposed publicly\nreleasing some metadata about each case on a paper\ncover sheet as a way to balance the competing goals of\n(1) secrecy, so the target of an investigation does not discover\nand sabotage it, and (2) accountability, to assure\nthe public that surveillance powers are not misused or\nabused.\nInspired by the courts\u2019 accountability challenge, we\nillustrate how accountability and secrecy are simultaneously\nachievable when modern cryptography is brought\nto bear. Our system improves configurability while preserving\nsecrecy, offering new tradeoffs potentially more\npalatable to the risk-averse court system. Judges, law\nenforcement, and companies publish commitments to\nsurveillance actions, argue in zero-knowledge that their\nbehavior is consistent, and compute aggregate surveillance\nstatistics by multi-party computation (MPC).\nWe demonstrate that these primitives perform efficiently\nat the scale of the federal judiciary. To do so,\nwe implement a hierarchical form of MPC that mirrors\nthe hierarchy of the court system. We also develop\nstatements in succinct zero-knowledge (SNARKs)\nwhose specificity can be tuned to calibrate the amount\nof information released. All told, our proposal not only\noffers the court system a flexible range of options for enhancing\naccountability in the face of necessary secrecy,\nbut also yields a general framework for accountability in\na broader class of secret information processes.",

            "abstract": "Memory-corruption attacks have been subject to extensive research in the latest decades. Researchers demonstrated sophisticated attack techniques, such as (just-in-time/blind) return-oriented programming and counterfeit object-oriented programming, which enable the attacker to execute arbitrary code and data-oriented attacks that are commonly used for privilege escalation. At the same time, the research community proposed a number of effective defense techniques. In particular, control-\ufb02ow integrity (CFI), code-pointer integrity (CPI), and \ufb01ne-grained code randomization are effective mitigation techniques against code-reuse attacks. All of these techniques require strong memory isolation. For example, CFI\u2019s shadow stack, CPI\u2019s safe-region, and the randomization secret must be protected from adversaries able to perform arbitrary read-write accesses. In this paper we propose IMIX, a lightweight, in-process memory isolation extension for the Intel-based x86 CPUs. Our solution extends the x86 ISA with a new memory-access permission to mark memory pages as security sensitive . These memory pages can then only be accessed with a newly introduced instruction. Unlike previous work, IMIX is not tailored towards a speci\ufb01c defense (technique) but can be leveraged as a primitive to protect the data of a wide variety of memory-corruption defenses. We provide a proof of concept of IMIX us-ing Intel\u2019s Simulation and Analysis Engine. We extend Clang/LLVM to include our new instruction, and enhance CPI by protecting CPI\u2019s safe region using IMIX.",

            "abstract": "Recently, advanced cyber attacks, which consist of a sequence of steps that involve many vulnerabilities and hosts, compromise the security of many well-protected businesses.\nThis has led to the solutions that ubiquitously monitor system activities in each host (big data) as a series of events, and search for anomalies (abnormal behaviors) for triaging risky events. Since fighting against these attacks is a time-critical mission to prevent further damage, these solutions face challenges in incorporating expert knowledge to perform timely anomaly detection over the large-scale provenance data.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel stream-based query system that takes as input, a real-time event feed aggregated from multiple hosts in an enterprise, and provides an anomaly query engine that queries the event feed to identify abnormal behaviors\nbased on the specified anomalies. To facilitate the task of expressing anomalies based on expert knowledge, our system provides a domain-specific query language, SAQL, which allows analysts to express models for (1) rule-based anomalies, (2) time-series anomalies, (3) invariant-based anomalies, and (4) outlier-based anomalies. We deployed our system in NEC Labs America comprising 150 hosts and evaluated it using 1.1TB of real system monitoring data (containing 3.3 billion events). Our evaluations on a broad set of attack behaviors and micro-benchmarks show that our system has a low detection latency (<2s) and a high system throughput (110,000 events/s; supporting ~4000 hosts), and is more efficient in memory utilization than the existing stream-based complex event processing systems.",

However, despite extensive research on the topic, no principled account exists for explaining when a password will be forgotten. This paper contributes new data and a set of analyses building on the ecological theory of memory and forgetting. We propose that human memory naturally adapts according to an estimate of how often a password will be needed, such that often used, important passwords are less likely to be forgotten. We derive models for login duration and odds of recall as a function of rate of use and number of uses thus far. The models achieved a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.8 seconds for login duration and 0.09 for recall odds for data collected in a month-long field experiment where frequency of password use was controlled. The theory and data shed new light on password management, account usage, password security and memorability.",

            "abstract": "The advent of Single Sign-On (SSO) has ushered in the era of a tightly interconnected Web. Users can now effortlessly navigate the Web and obtain a personalized experience without the hassle of creating and managing accounts across different services. Due to the proliferation of SSO, user accounts in identity providers are now keys to the kingdom and pose a massive security risk. If such an account is compromised, attackers can gain control of the user\u2019s accounts in numerous other web services. In this paper we investigate the security implications of SSO and offer an in-depth analysis of account hijacking on the modern Web. Our experiments explore multiple aspects of the attack workflow and reveal significant variance in how services deploy SSO. We also introduce novel attacks that leverage SSO for maintaining long-term control of user accounts. We empirically evaluate our attacks against 95 major web and mobile services and demonstrate their severity and stealthy nature. Next we explore what session and account management options are available to users after an account is compromised. Our findings highlight the inherent limitations of prevalent SSO schemes as most services lack the functionality that would allow users to remediate an account takeover. This is exacerbated by the scale of SSO coverage, rendering manual remediation attempts a futile endeavor. To remedy this we propose Single Sign-Off, an extension to OpenID Connect for universally revoking access to all the accounts associated with the hijacked identity provider account.",

            "abstract": "To stop side channel attacks on CPU caches that have allowed attackers to leak secret information and break basic security mechanisms, the security community has developed a variety of powerful defenses that effectively isolate the security domains. Of course, other shared hardware resources exist, but the assumption is that unlike cache side channels, any channel offered by these resources is insufficiently reliable and too coarse-grained to leak general-purpose information. This is no longer true. In this paper, we revisit this assumption and show for the first time that hardware translation lookaside buffers (TLBs) can be abused to leak fine-grained information about a victim's activity even when CPU cache activity is guarded by state-of-the-art cache side-channel protections, such as CAT and TSX. However, exploiting the TLB channel is challenging, due to unknown addressing functions inside the TLB and the attacker's limited monitoring capabilities which, at best, cover only the victim's coarse-grained data accesses. To address the former, we reverse engineer the previously unknown addressing function in recent Intel processors. To address the latter, we devise a machine learning strategy that exploits high-resolution temporal features about a victim's memory activity. Our prototype implementation, TLBleed, can leak a 256-bit EdDSA secret key from a single capture after 17 seconds of computation time with a 98% success rate, even in presence of state-of-the-art cache isolation. Similarly, using a single capture, TLBleed reconstructs 92% of RSA keys from an implementation that is hardened against FLUSH+RELOAD attacks.",

The attacks allow an adversary to reset and forge platform configuration registers which are designed to securely hold measurements of software that are used for bootstrapping a computer. One attack is exploiting a design flaw in the TPM 2.0 specification for the static root of trust for measurement (SRTM). The other attack is exploiting an implementation flaw in tboot, the most popular measured launched environment used with Intel's Trusted Execution Technology. Considering TPM-based platform integrity protection is widely used, the attacks may affect a large number of devices. We demonstrate the attacks with commodity hardware. The SRTM attack is significant because its countermeasure requires hardware-specific firmware patches that could take a long time to be applied.",

            "abstract": "The success of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) relies on the mapping system that leverages dynamically generated DNS records to distribute client requests to a proximal server for achieving optimal content delivery. However, the mapping system is vulnerable to malicious hijacks, as (1) it is difficult to provide precomputed DNSSEC signatures for dynamically generated records, and (2) even considering when DNSSEC is enabled, DNSSEC itself is vulnerable to replay attacks. By leveraging crafted but legitimate mapping between the end-user and edge server, adversaries can hijack CDN\u2019s request redirection and nullify the benefits offered by CDNs, such as proximal access, load balancing, and Denial-of-Service (DoS) protection, while remaining undetectable by existing security practices including DNSSEC. In this paper, we investigate the security implications of dynamic mapping that remain understudied in security and CDN communities. We perform a characterization of CDN\u2019s service delivery and assess this fundamental vulnerability in DNS-based CDNs in the wild. We demonstrate that DNSSEC is ineffective to address this problem, even with the newly adopted ECDSA that is capable of achieving live signing. We then discuss practical countermeasures against such manipulation.",

            "abstract": "Privacy policies are the primary channel through which companies inform users about their data collection and sharing practices. These policies are often long and difficult to comprehend. Short notices based on information extracted from privacy policies have been shown to be useful but face a significant scalability hurdle, given the number of policies and their evolution over time. Companies, users, researchers, and regulators still lack usable and scalable tools to cope with the breadth and depth of privacy policies. To address these hurdles, we propose an automated framework for privacy policy analysis (Polisis). It enables scalable, dynamic, and multi-dimensional queries on natural language privacy policies. At the core of Polisis is a privacy-centric language model, built with 130K privacy policies, and a novel hierarchy of neural-network classifiers that accounts for both high-level aspects and fine-grained details of privacy practices. We demonstrate Polisis\u2019 modularity and utility with two applications supporting structured and free-form querying. The structured querying application is the automated assignment of privacy icons from privacy policies. With Polisis, we can achieve an accuracy of 88.4% on this task. The second application, PriBot, is the first freeform question-answering system for privacy policies. We show that PriBot can produce a correct answer among its top-3 results for 82% of the test questions. Using an MTurk user study with 700 participants, we show that at least one of PriBot\u2019s top-3 answers is relevant to users for 89% of the test questions.",

            "abstract": "Mobile \ufb01tness tracking apps allow users to track their workouts and share them with friends through online social networks. Although the sharing of personal data is an inherent risk in all social networks, the dangers presented by sharing personal workouts comprised of geospatial and health data may prove especially grave. While \ufb01tness apps offer a variety of privacy features, at present it is unclear if these countermeasures are suf\ufb01-cient to thwart a determined attacker, nor is it clear how many of these services\u2019 users are at risk. In this work, we perform a systematic analysis of privacy behaviors and threats in \ufb01tness tracking social networks. Collecting a month-long snapshot of public posts of a popular \ufb01tness tracking service (21 million posts, 3 million users), we observe that 16.5% of users make use of Endpoint Privacy Zones (EPZs), which conceal \ufb01tness activity near user-designated sensitive locations (e.g., home, of\ufb01ce). We go on to develop an attack against EPZs that infers users\u2019 protected locations from the remaining available information in public posts, discovering that 95.1% of moderately active users are at risk of having their protected locations extracted by an attacker. Finally, we consider the ef\ufb01cacy of state-of-the-art privacy mechanisms through adapting geo-indistinguishability techniques as well as developing a novel EPZ fuzzing technique. The affected companies have been noti\ufb01ed of the discovered vulnerabilities and at the time of publication have incorporated our proposed countermeasures into their production systems.",

In a 425-participant online user study, we \ufb01nd stark differences in participants\u2019 desired access-control policies for different capabilities within a single device, as well as based on who is trying to use that capability. From these desired policies, we identify likely candidates for default policies. We also pinpoint necessary primitives for specifying more complex, yet desired, access-control policies. These primitives range from the time of day to the current location of users. Finally, we discuss the degree to which different authentication methods potentially support desired policies.",

            "abstract": "Heap layout manipulation is integral to exploiting heap-based memory corruption vulnerabilities.  In this paper we present the first automatic approach to the problem, based on pseudo-random black-box search.  Our approach searches for the inputs required to place the source of a heap-based buffer overflow or underflow next to heap-allocated objects that an exploit developer, or automatic exploit generation system, wishes to read or corrupt.  We present a framework for benchmarking heap layout manipulation algorithms, and use it to evaluate our approach on several real-world allocators, showing that pseudo-random black box search can be highly effective.  We then present SHRIKE, a novel system that can perform automatic heap layout manipulation on the PHP interpreter and can be used in the construction of control-flow hijacking exploits.  Starting from PHP's regression tests, SHRIKE discovers fragments of PHP code that interact with the interpreter's heap in useful ways, such as making allocations and deallocations of particular sizes, or allocating objects containing sensitive data, such as pointers.  SHRIKE then uses our search algorithm to piece together these fragments into programs, searching for one that achieves a desired heap layout.  SHRIKE allows an exploit developer to focus on the higher level concepts in an exploit, and to defer the resolution of heap layout constraints to SHRIKE.  We demonstrate this by using SHRIKE in the construction of a control-flow hijacking exploit for the PHP interpreter.",

System audit logs provide crucial information that underpins such analysis. Unfortunately, audit data collected over months or years can grow to enormous sizes. Large data size is not only a storage concern: forensic analysis tasks can become very slow when they must sift through billions of records. In this paper, we first present two powerful event reduction techniques that reduce the number of records by a factor of 4.6 to 19 in our experiments. An important benefit of our techniques is that they provably preserve the accuracy of forensic analysis tasks such as backtracking and impact analysis. While providing this guarantee, our techniques reduce on-disk file sizes by an average of 35\u00d7 across our data sets. On average, our in-memory dependence graph uses just 5 bytes per event in the original data. Our system is able to consume and analyze nearly a million events per second.",

            "abstract": "Spear phishing has been a persistent threat to users and organizations, and yet email providers still face key challenges to authenticate incoming emails. As a result, attackers can apply spoofing techniques to impersonate a trusted entity to conduct highly deceptive phishing attacks. In this work, we study email spoofing to answer three key questions: (1) How do email providers detect and handle forged emails? (2) Under what conditions can forged emails penetrate the defense to reach user inbox? (3) Once the forged email gets in, how email providers warn users? Is the warning truly effective? We answer these questions by conducting an end-toend measurement on 35 popular email providers and examining user reactions to spoofing through a real-world spoofing/phishing test. Our key findings are three folds. First, we observe that most email providers have the necessary protocols to detect spoofing, but still allow forged emails to reach the user inbox (e.g., Yahoo Mail, iCloud, Gmail). Second, once a forged email gets in, most email providers have no warning for users, particularly for mobile email apps. Some providers (e.g., Gmail Inbox) even have misleading UIs that make the forged email look authentic. Third, a few email providers (9/35) have implemented visual security indicators on unverified emails. Our phishing experiment shows that security indicators have a positive impact on reducing risky user actions, but cannot eliminate the risk. Our study reveals a major miscommunication between email providers and endusers. Improvements at both ends (server-side protocols and UIs) are needed to bridge the gap.",

            "abstract": "Investigating attacks across multiple hosts is challenging. The true dependencies between security-sensitive files, network endpoints, or memory objects from different hosts can be easily concealed by dependency explosion or undefined program behavior (e.g., memory corruption). Dynamic information flow tracking (DIFT) is a potential solution to this problem, but, existing DIFT techniques only track information flow within a single host and lack an efficient mechanism to maintain and synchronize the data flow tags globally across multiple hosts. \n \nIn this paper, we propose RTAG, an efficient data flow tagging and tracking mechanism that enables practical cross-host attack investigations. RTAG is based on three novel techniques. First, by using a record-and-replay technique, it decouples the dependencies between different data flow tags from the analysis, enabling lazy synchronization between independent and parallel DIFT instances of different hosts. Second, it takes advantage of systemcall-level provenance information to calculate and allocate the optimal tag map in terms of memory consumption. Third, it embeds tag information into network packets to track cross-host data flows with less than 0.05% network bandwidth overhead. Evaluation results show that RTAG is able to recover the true data flows of realistic cross-host attack scenarios. Performance wise, RTAG reduces the memory consumption of DIFT-based analysis by up to 90% and decreases the overall analysis time by 60%-90% compared with previous investigation systems.",

            "abstract": "Users in various web and mobile applications are vulnerable to attribute inference attacks, in which an attacker leverages a machine learning classifier to infer a target user's private attributes (e.g., location, sexual orientation, political view) from its public data (e.g., rating scores, page likes). Existing defenses leverage game theory or heuristics based on correlations between the public data and attributes. These defenses are not practical. Specifically, game-theoretic defenses require solving intractable optimization problems, while correlation-based defenses incur large utility loss of users' public data. \nIn this paper, we present AttriGuard, a practical defense against attribute inference attacks. AttriGuard is computationally tractable and has small utility loss. Our AttriGuard works in two phases. Suppose we aim to protect a user's private attribute. In Phase I, for each value of the attribute, we find a minimum noise such that if we add the noise to the user's public data, then the attacker's classifier is very likely to infer the attribute value for the user. We find the minimum noise via adapting existing evasion attacks in adversarial machine learning. In Phase II, we sample one attribute value according to a certain probability distribution and add the corresponding noise found in Phase I to the user's public data. We formulate finding the probability distribution as solving a constrained convex optimization problem. We extensively evaluate AttriGuard and compare it with existing methods using a real-world dataset. Our results show that AttriGuard substantially outperforms existing methods. Our work is the first one that shows evasion attacks can be used as defensive techniques for privacy protection.",

            "abstract": "The growing popularity of cloud-based machine learning raises natural questions about the privacy guarantees that can be provided in such settings. Our work tackles this problem in the context of prediction-as-a-service wherein a server has a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on its private data and wishes to provide classifications on clients' private images. Our goal is to build efficient protocols whereby the client can acquire the classification result without revealing their input to the server, while guaranteeing the privacy of the server's neural network. To this end, we design Gazelle, a scalable and low-latency system for secure neural network inference, using an intricate combination of homomorphic encryption and traditional two-party computation techniques (such as garbled circuits). Gazelle makes three contributions. First, we design the Gazelle homomorphic encryption library which provides fast algorithms for basic homomorphic operations such as SIMD (single instruction multiple data) addition, SIMD multiplication and ciphertext permutation. Second, we implement the Gazelle homomorphic linear algebra kernels which map neural network layers to optimized homomorphic matrix-vector multiplication and convolution routines. Third, we design optimized encryption switching protocols which seamlessly convert between homomorphic and garbled circuit encodings to enable implementation of complete neural network inference. We evaluate our protocols on benchmark neural networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets and show that Gazelle outperforms the best existing systems such as MiniONN (ACM CCS 2017) and Chameleon (Crypto Eprint 2017/1164) by 20--30x in online runtime. When compared with fully homomorphic approaches like CryptoNets (ICML 2016), we demonstrate three orders of magnitude faster online run-time.",

            "abstract": "We present Arbitrum, a cryptocurrency system that supports smart contracts without the scalability and privacy limitations of previous systems such as Ethereum. Arbitrum, like Ethereum, allows parties to create smart contracts by using code to specify the behavior of a virtual machine (VM) that implements the contract\u2019s functionality. Arbitrum uses mechanism design to incentivize parties to agree off-chain on what a VM would do, so that the Arbitrum miners need only verify digital signatures to confirm that parties have agreed on a VM\u2019s behavior. In the event that the parties cannot reach unanimous agreement off-chain, Arbitrum still allows honest parties to advance the VM state on-chain. If a party tries to lie about a VM\u2019s behavior, the verifier (or miners) will identify and penalize the dishonest party by using a highlyefficient challenge-based protocol that exploits features of the Arbitrum virtual machine architecture. Moving the verification of VMs\u2019 behavior off-chain in this way provides dramatic improvements in scalability and privacy. We describe Arbitrum\u2019s protocol and virtual machine architecture, and we present a working prototype",

In this paper, we examine the extent to which anonymity is achieved in the deployed version of Zcash.  We investigate all facets of anonymity in Zcash's transactions, ranging from its transparent transactions to the interactions with and within its main privacy feature, a shielded pool that acts as the anonymity set for users wishing to spend coins privately.  We conclude that while it is possible to use Zcash in a private way, it is also possible to shrink its anonymity set considerably by developing simple heuristics based on identifiable patterns of usage.",

            "abstract": "Recent measurement studies have highlighted security threats against the code-signing public key infrastructure (PKI), such as certificates that had been compromised or issued directly to the malware authors. The primary mechanism for mitigating these threats is to revoke the abusive certificates. However, the distributed yet closed nature of the code signing PKI makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of revocations in this ecosystem. In consequence, the magnitude of signed malware threat is not fully understood. In this paper, we collect seven datasets, including the largest corpus of code-signing certificates, and we combine them to analyze the revocation process from end to end. Effective revocations rely on three roles: (1) discovering the abusive certificates, (2) revoking the certificates effectively, and (3) disseminating the revocation information for clients. We assess the challenge for discovering compromised certificates and the subsequent revocation delays. We show that erroneously setting revocation dates causes signed malware to remain valid even after the certificate has been revoked. We also report failures in disseminating the revocations, leading clients to continue trusting the revoked certificates.",

Although these devices rely on accurate speech recognition for correct functionality, many users experience frequent misinterpretations in normal use. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis of interpretation errors made by Amazon Alexa, the speech-recognition engine that powers the Amazon Echo family of devices. We leverage a dataset of 11,460 speech samples containing English words spoken by American speakers and identify where Alexa misinterprets the audio inputs, how often, and why. We find that certain misinterpretations appear consistently in repeated trials and are systematic. Next, we present and validate a new attack, called skill squatting. In skill squatting, an attacker leverages systematic errors to route a user to malicious application without their knowledge. In a variant of the attack we call spear skill squatting, we further demonstrate that this attack can be targeted at specific demographic groups. We conclude with a discussion of the security implications of speech interpretation errors, countermeasures, and future work.",

            "abstract": "Passwords and access control remain the popular choice for protecting sensitive data stored online, despite their well-known vulnerability to brute-force attacks. A natural solution is to use encryption. Although standard practices of using encryption somewhat alleviate the problem, decryption is often needed for utility, and keeping the decryption key within reach is obviously dangerous. \n \nTo address this seemingly unavoidable problem in data security, we propose password-hardened encryption (PHE). With the help of an external crypto server, a service provider can recover the user data encrypted by PHE only when an end user supplied a correct password. PHE inherits the security features of password-hardening (Usenix Security '15), adding protection for the user data. In particular, the crypto server does not learn any information about any user data. More importantly, both the crypto server and the service provider can rotate their secret keys, a proactive security mechanism mandated by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). \n \nWe build an extremely simple password-hardened encryption scheme. Compared with the state-of-the-art password-hardening scheme (Usenix Security '17), our scheme only uses minimal number-theoretic operations and is, therefore, 30% - 50% more efficient. In fact, our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our scheme can handle more than 525 encryption and (successful) decryption requests per second per core, which shows that it is lightweight and readily deployable in large-scale systems. Regarding security, our scheme also achieves a stronger soundness property, which puts less trust on the good behavior of the crypto server.",

The Second Crypto War, which began rearing its head shortly after the First Crypto War ended, appears to be about end-to-end encryption and locked mobile devices. It looks as if law enforcement is seeking exceptional access\u2014access to encrypted communications and secured devices\u2014through regulation or legislation.\nBut things are seldom as they seem, and so it is with the Second Crypto War.

In this paper, we present Meltdown. Meltdown exploits side effects of out-of-order execution on modern processors to read arbitrary kernel-memory locations including personal data and passwords. Out-of-order execution is an indispensable performance feature and present in a wide range of modern processors. The attack is independent of the operating system, and it does not rely on any software vulnerabilities. Meltdown breaks all security guarantees provided by address space isolation as well as paravirtualized environments and, thus, every security mechanism building upon this foundation. On affected systems, Meltdown enables an adversary to read memory of other processes or virtual machines in the cloud without any permissions or privileges, affecting millions of customers and virtually every user of a personal computer. We show that the KAISER defense mechanism for KASLR has the important (but inadvertent) side effect of impeding Meltdown. We stress that KAISER must be deployed immediately to prevent large-scale exploitation of this severe information leakage.",

            "abstract": "DNS queries from end users are handled by recursive DNS servers for scalability. For convenience, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) assign recursive servers for their clients automatically when the clients choose the default network settings. But users should also have flexibility to use their preferred recursive servers, like public DNS servers. This kind of trust, however, can be broken by the hidden interception of the DNS resolution path (which we term as DNSIntercept).  Specifically, on-path devices could spoof the IP addresses of user-specified DNS servers and intercept the DNS queries surreptitiously, introducing privacy and security issues. In this paper, we perform a large-scale analysis of on-path DNS interception and shed light on its scope and characteristics. We design novel approaches to detect DNS interception and leverage 148,478 residential and cellular IP addresses around the world for analysis. As a result, we find that 259 of the 3,047 ASes (8.5%) that we inspect exhibit DNS interception behavior, including large providers, such as China Mobile. Moreover, we find that the DNS servers of the ASes which intercept requests may use outdated vulnerable software (deprecated before 2009) and lack security-related functionality, such as handling DNSSEC requests. Our work highlights the issues around on-path DNS interception and provides new insights for addressing such issues.",

Specifically, a malicious user can masquerade a zero-rating CP or alter an existing zero-rating communication to evade charges enforced by the Internet Service Provider (ISP).  According to our study, major commercial ISPs, such as T-Mobile, China Mobile, and airport WiFi, are all vulnerable to such free-riding attacks.  In this paper, we propose a secure, backward compatible, zero-rating framework, called ZFree, which only allows network traffic authorized by the correct CP to be zero-rated. We perform a formal security analysis using ProVerif, and the results show that ZFree is secure, i.e., preserving both packet integrity and CP server authenticity. We have implemented an open-source prototype of ZFree available at this repository (https://github.com/zfree2018/ZFREE).  A working demo is at this link (http://zfree.org/).  Our evaluation shows that ZFree is lightweight, scalable and secure.",

To remedy the situation, users are very often referred to password managers as a solution to the password reuse and weakness problems. However, to date, the actual impact of password managers on password strength and reuse has not been studied systematically. \n \nWe provide the first large-scale study of the password managers' influence on users' real-life passwords. By combining qualitative data on users' password creation and management strategies, collected from 476 participants of an online survey, with quantitative data (incl. password metrics and entry methods) collected in situ with a browser plugin from 170 users, we were able to gain a more complete picture of the factors that influence our participants' password strength and reuse. Our approach allows us to quantify for the first time that password managers indeed influence the password security, however, whether this influence is beneficial or aggravating existing problems depends on the users' strategies and how well the manager supports the users' password management right from the time of password creation. Given our results, we think research should further investigate how managers can better support users' password strategies in order to improve password security as well as stop aggravating the existing problems.",

Brokered delegation allows users to flexibly delegate credentials and rights for a range of service providers to other users and third parties. We explore how brokered delegation can be implemented using novel trusted execution environments (TEEs). We introduce a system called DelegaTEE that enables users (Delegatees) to log into different online services using the credentials of other users (Owners). Credentials in DelegaTEE are never revealed to Delegatees and Owners can restrict access to their accounts using a range of rich, contextually dependent delegation policies. DelegaTEE fundamentally shifts existing access control models for centralized online services. It does so by using TEEs to permit access delegation at the user's discretion. DelegaTEE thus effectively reduces mandatory access control (MAC) in this context to discretionary access control (DAC). The system demonstrates the significant potential for TEEs to create new forms of resource sharing around online services without the direct support from those services.We present a full implementation of DelegaTEE using Intel SGX and demonstrate its use in four real-world applications: email access (SMTP/IMAP), restricted website access using a HTTPS proxy, e-banking/credit card, and a third-party payment system (PayPal).",

Yet, despite the risk, most network operators still allow path tracing as it is an essential network debugging tool. \n \nIn this paper, we present NetHide, a network topology obfuscation framework that mitigates LFAs while preserving the practicality of path tracing tools. The key idea behind NetHide is to formulate network obfuscation as a multi-objective optimization problem that allows for a flexible tradeoff between security (encoded as hard constraints) and usability (encoded as soft constraints). While solving this problem exactly is hard, we show that NetHide can obfuscate topologies at scale by only considering a subset of the candidate solutions and without reducing obfuscation quality. In practice, NetHide obfuscates the topology by intercepting and modifying path tracing probes directly in the data plane. We show that this process can be done at line-rate, in a stateless fashion, by leveraging the latest generation of programmable network devices. \n \nWe fully implemented NetHide and evaluated it on realistic topologies. Our results show that NetHide is able to obfuscate large topologies (> 150 nodes) while preserving near-perfect debugging capabilities. In particular, we show that operators can still precisely trace back > 90% of link failures despite obfuscation.",

And yet, it is not well understood how reproducible the crowd-reported vulnerabilities are. In this paper, we perform the \ufb01rst empirical analysis on a wide range of real-world security vulnerabilities (368 in total) with the goal of quantifying their reproducibility. Following a carefully controlled work\ufb02ow, we organize a focused group of security analysts to carry out reproduction experiments. With 3600 man-hours spent, we obtain quantitative evidence on the prevalence of missing information in vulnerability reports and the low reproducibility of the vulnerabilities. We \ufb01nd that relying on a single vulnerability report from a popular security forum is generally dif\ufb01cult to succeed due to the incomplete information. By widely crowdsourcing the information gathering, security analysts could increase the reproduction success rate, but still face key challenges to trou-bleshoot the non-reproducible cases. To further explore solutions, we surveyed hackers, researchers, and engineers who have extensive domain expertise in software security (N=43). Going beyond Internet-scale crowd-sourcing, we \ufb01nd that, security professionals heavily rely on manual debugging and speculative guessing to infer the missed information. Our result suggests that there is not only a necessity to overhaul the way a security forum collects vulnerability reports, but also a need for automated mechanisms to collect information commonly missing in a report.",

We explore the use of the standard POSIX socket API as a vehicle for a simplified TLS API, while also giving administrators the ability to control applications and tailor TLS configuration to their needs. We first assess OpenSSL and its uses in open source software, recommending how this functionality should be accommodated within the POSIX API. We then propose the Secure Socket API (SSA), a minimalist TLS API built using existing network functions and find that it can be employed by existing network applications by modifications requiring as little as one line of code. We next describe a prototype SSA implementation that leverages network system calls to provide privilege separation and support for other programming languages. We end with a discussion of the benefits and limitations of the SSA and our accompanying implementation, noting avenues for future work.",

            "abstract": "OS fuzzers primarily test the system-call interface between the OS kernel and user-level applications for security vulnerabilities. The effectiveness of all existing evolutionary OS fuzzers depends heavily on the quality and diversity of their seed system call sequences. However, generating good seeds for OS fuzzing is a hard problem as the behavior of each system call depends heavily on the OS kernel state created by the previously executed system calls. Therefore, popular evolutionary OS fuzzers often rely on hand-coded rules for generating valid seed sequences of system calls that can bootstrap the fuzzing process. Unfortunately, this approach severely restricts the diversity of the seed system call sequences and therefore limits the effectiveness of the fuzzers. In this paper, we develop MoonShine, a novel strategy for distilling seeds for OS fuzzers from system call traces of real-world programs while still preserving the dependencies across the system calls. MoonShine leverages light-weight static analysis for efficiently detecting dependencies across different system calls. We designed and implemented MoonShine as an extension to Syzkaller, a state-of-the-art evolutionary fuzzer for the Linux kernel. Starting from traces containing 2.8 million system calls gathered from 3,220 real-world programs, MoonShine distilled down to just over 14,000 calls while preserving 86% of the original code coverage. Using these distilled seed system call sequences, MoonShine was able to improve Syzkaller\u2019s achieved code coverage for the Linux kernel by 13% on average. MoonShine also found 17 new vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel that were not found by Syzkaller.",

            "abstract": "Android apps having access to private information may be legitimate, depending on whether the app provides users enough semantics to justify the access. Existing works analyzing app semantics are coarse-grained, staying on the app-level. That is, they can only identify whether an app, as a whole, should request a certain permission, but cannot answer whether a specific app behavior under certain runtime context, such as an information flow, is correctly justified.To address this issue, we propose FlowCog, an automated, flow-level system to extract flow-specific semantics and correlate such semantics with given information flows. Particularly, FlowCog statically finds all the Android views that are related to the given flow via control or data dependencies, and then extracts semantics, such as texts and images, from these views and associated layouts. Next, FlowCog adopts a natural language processing (NLP) approach to infer whether the extracted semantics are correlated with the given flow. FlowCog is open-source and available at https://github.com/SocietyMaster/FlowCog. Our evaluation shows that FlowCog can achieve a precision of 90.1% and a recall of 93.1%.",

We describe novel attacks built upon a technique we call mal-leability gadgets to reveal the plaintext of encrypted emails. We use CBC/CFB gadgets to inject malicious plaintext snippets into encrypted emails. These snippets abuse existing and standard conforming backchannels to ex\ufb01ltrate the full plaintext after decryption. We describe malleability gadgets for emails using HTML, CSS, and X.509 functionality. The attack works for emails even if they were collected long ago, and it is triggered as soon as the recipient decrypts a single maliciously crafted email from the attacker. We devise working attacks for both OpenPGP and S/MIME encryption, and show that ex\ufb01ltration channels exist for 23 of the 35 tested S/MIME email clients and 10 of the 28 tested OpenPGP email clients. While it is ad-visable to update the OpenPGP and S/MIME standards to \ufb01x these vulnerabilities, some clients had even more severe implementation \ufb02aws allowing straightforward ex-\ufb01ltration of the plaintext.",

RATs are used for surveillance, information theft, and extortion of victims. In this work, we report on the attackers and victims for two popular RATs, njRAT and DarkComet. Using the malware repository VirusTotal, we find all instances of these RATs and identify the domain names of their controllers. We then register those domains that have expired and direct them to our measurement infrastructure, allowing us to determine the victims of these campaigns. We investigate several techniques for excluding network scanners and sandbox executions of malware samples in order to filter apparent infections that are not real victims of the campaign. Our results show that over 99% of the 828,137 IP addresses that connected to our sinkhole are likely not real victims. We report on the number of victims, how long RAT campaigns remain active, and the geographic relationship between victims and attackers.",

Adversaries increasingly acquire card data using skimmers, which are attached to legitimate payment devices including point of sale terminals, gas pumps, and ATMs. Detecting such devices can be difficult, and while many experts offer advice in doing so, there exists no large-scale characterization of skimmer technology to support such defenses. In this paper, we perform the first such study based on skimmers recovered by the NYPD's Financial Crimes Task Force over a 16 month period. After systematizing these devices, we develop the Skim Reaper, a detector which takes advantage of the physical properties and constraints necessary for many skimmers to steal card data. Our analysis shows the Skim Reaper effectively detects 100% of devices supplied by the NYPD. In so doing, we provide the first robust and portable mechanism for detecting card skimmers.",

            "abstract": "Cache attacks have increasingly gained momentum in the security community. In such attacks, attacker-controlled code sharing the cache with a designated victim can leak confidential data by timing the execution of cache-accessing operations. Much recent work has focused on defenses that enforce cache access isolation between mutually distrusting software components. In such a landscape, many software-based defenses have been popularized, given their appealing portability and scalability guarantees. All such defenses prevent attacker-controlled CPU instructions from accessing a cache partition dedicated to a different security domain. In this paper, we present a new class of attacks (indirect cache attacks), which can bypass all the existing software-based defenses. In such attacks, rather than accessing the cache directly, attacker-controlled code lures an external, trusted component into indirectly accessing the cache partition of the victim and mount a confused-deputy side-channel attack. To demonstrate the viability of these attacks, we focus on the MMU, demonstrating that indirect cache attacks based on translation operations performed by the MMU are practical and can be used to bypass all the existing software-based defenses. Our results show that the isolation enforced by existing defense techniques is imperfect and that generalizing such techniques to mitigate arbitrary cache attacks is much more challenging than previously assumed.",

It relies on machine-learning based classification of NXDs (i.e., domain names included in negative DNS responses), into DGA-related and benign NXDs. The features for classification are extracted exclusively from the individual NXD that is to be classified. We evaluate the system on malicious data generated by 59 DGAs from the DGArchive, data recorded in a large university\u2019s campus network, and data recorded on the internal network of a large company. We show that the system yields a very high classification accuracy at a low false positive rate, generalizes very well, and is able to identify previously unknown DGAs.",

Such methods can compromise the privacy of an anonymous author even when the author tries to remove privacy sensitive content. In this paper, we propose an automatic method, called Adversarial Author Attribute Anonymity Neural Translation ($A^4NT$), to combat such text-based adversaries. We combine sequence-to-sequence language models used in machine translation and generative adversarial networks to obfuscate author attributes. Unlike machine translation techniques which need paired data, our method can be trained on unpaired corpora of text containing different authors. Importantly, we propose and evaluate techniques to impose constraints on our $A^4NT$ to preserve the semantics of the input text. $A^4NT$ learns to make minimal changes to the input text to successfully fool author attribute classifiers, while aiming to maintain the meaning of the input. We show through experiments on two different datasets and three settings that our proposed method is effective in fooling the author attribute classifiers and thereby improving the anonymity of authors.",

GUARDER is different from existing secure allocators in the following aspects. Existing allocators either have low/zero randomization entropy, or cannot provide stable security guarantees, where their entropies vary by object size classes, execution phases, inputs, or applications. GUARDER ensures the desired randomization entropy, and provides an unprecedented level of security guarantee by combining all security features of existing allocators, with overhead that is comparable to performance-oriented allocators. Compared to the default Linux allocator, GUARDER'S performance overhead is less than 3% on average. This overhead is similar to the previous state-of-the-art, Free-Guard, but comes with a much stronger security guarantee. GUARDER also provides an additional feature that allows users to customize security based on their performance budget, without changing code or even recompiling. The combination of high security and low overhead makes GUARDER a practical solution for the deployed environment.",

            "abstract": "Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) is a class of algorithmic complexity attacks where matching a regular expression against an attacker-provided input takes unexpectedly long. The single-threaded execution model of JavaScript makes JavaScript-based web servers particularly susceptible to ReDoS attacks. Despite this risk and the increasing popularity of the server-side Node.js platform, there is currently little reported knowledge about the severity of the ReDoS problem in practice. This paper presents a large-scale study of ReDoS vulnerabilities in real-world web sites. Underlying our study is a novel methodology for analyzing the exploitability of deployed servers. The basic idea is to search for previously unknown vulnerabilities in popular libraries, hypothesize how these libraries may be used by servers, and to then craft targeted exploits. In the course of the study, we identify 25 previously unknown vulnerabilities in popular modules and test 2,846 of the most popular websites against them. We find that 339 of these web sites suffer from at least one ReDoS vulnerability. Since a single request can block a vulnerable site for several seconds, and sometimes even much longer, ReDoS poses a serious threat to the availability of these sites. Our results are a call-to-arms for developing techniques to detect and mitigate ReDoS vulnerabilities in JavaScript.",

However, no threat-modeling techniques have been systematically evaluated in a real-world, enterprise environment. In this case study, we introduce formalized threat modeling to New York City Cyber Command: the primary digital defense organization for the most populous city in the United States. We find that threat modeling improved self-efficacy; 20 of 25 participants regularly incorporated it within their daily duties 30 days after training, without further prompting. After 120 days, implemented participantdesigned threat mitigation strategies provided tangible security benefits for NYC, including blocking 541 unique intrusion attempts, preventing the hijacking of five privileged user accounts, and addressing three public-facing server vulnerabilities. Overall, these results suggest that the introduction of threat modeling can provide valuable benefits in an enterprise setting.",

            "abstract": "Recent results suggest that attacks against supervised machine learning systems are quite effective, while defenses are easily bypassed by new attacks.  However, the specifications for machine learning systems currently lack precise adversary definitions, and the existing attacks make diverse, potentially unrealistic assumptions about the strength of the adversary who launches them. We propose the FAIL attacker model, which describes the adversary's knowledge and control along four dimensions. Our model allows us to consider a wide range of weaker adversaries who have limited control and incomplete knowledge of the features, learning algorithms and training instances utilized.  To evaluate the utility of the FAIL model, we consider the problem of conducting targeted poisoning attacks in a realistic setting: the crafted poison samples must have clean labels, must be individually and collectively inconspicuous, and must exhibit a generalized form of transferability, defined by the FAIL model. By taking these constraints into account, we design StingRay, a targeted poisoning attack that is practical against 4 machine learning applications, which use 3 different learning algorithms, and can bypass 2 existing defenses. Conversely, we show that a prior evasion attack is less effective under generalized transferability. Such attack evaluations, under the FAIL adversary model, may also suggest promising directions for future defenses.",

            "abstract": "Lightweight virtualization (i.e., containers) offers a virtual host environment for applications without the need for a separate kernel, enabling better resource utilization and improved efficiency. However, the shared kernel also prevents containers from taking advantage of security features that are available to traditional VMs and hosts. Containers cannot apply local policies to govern integrity measurement, code execution, mandatory access control, etc. to prevent application-specific security problems. Changes have been proposed to make kernel security mechanisms available to containers, but such changes are often adhoc and expose the challenges of trusting containers to make security decisions without compromising host system or other containers. In this paper, we propose security namespaces, a kernel abstraction that enables containers to have an autonomous control over their security. The security namespace relaxes the global and mandatory assumption of kernel security frameworks, thus enabling containers to independently define security policies and apply them to a limited scope of processes. To preserve security, we propose a routing mechanism that can dynamically dispatch an operation to a set of containers whose security might be affected by the operation, therefore ensuring the security decision made by one container cannot compromise the host or other containers. We demonstrate security namespace by developing namespaces for integrity measurement and mandatory access control in the Linux kernel for use by Docker containers. Results show that security namespaces can effectively mitigate security problems within containers (e.g., malicious code execution) with less than 0.7% additional latency to system call and almost identical application throughput. As a result, security namespaces enable containers to obtain autonomous control over their security without compromising the security of other containers or the host system.",

            "abstract": "Mobile systems, such as smartphones and tablets, incorporate a diverse set of I/O devices, such as camera, audio devices, GPU, and sensors. This in turn results in a large number of diverse and customized device drivers running in the operating system kernel of mobile systems. These device drivers contain various bugs and vulnerabilities, making them a top target for kernel exploits [78]. Unfortunately, security analysts face important challenges in analyzing these device drivers in order to find, understand, and patch vulnerabilities. More specifically, using the state-of-the-art dynamic analysis techniques such as interactive debugging, fuzzing, and record-and-replay for analysis of these drivers is difficult, inefficient, or even completely inaccessible depending on the analysis. In this paper, we present Charm1, a system solution that facilitates dynamic analysis of device drivers of mobile systems. Charm\u2019s key technique is remote device driver execution, which enables the device driver to execute in a virtual machine on a workstation. Charm makes this possible by using the actual mobile system only for servicing the low-level and infrequent I/O operations through a low-latency and customized USB channel. Charm does not require any specialized hardware and is immediately available to analysts. We show that it is feasible to apply Charm to various device drivers, including camera, audio, GPU, and IMU sensor drivers, in different mobile systems, including LG Nexus 5X, Huawei Nexus 6P, and Samsung Galaxy S7. In an extensive evaluation, we show that Charm enhances the usability of fuzzing of device drivers, enables record-andreplay of driver\u2019s execution, and facilitates detailed vulnerability analysis. Altogether, these capabilities have enabled us to find 25 bugs in device drivers, analyze 3 existing ones, and even build an arbitrary-code-execution kernel exploit using one of them. 1Charm is open sourced: https://trusslab.github.io/charm/",

            "abstract": "Inertial sensors provide crucial feedback for control systems to determine motional status and make timely, automated decisions. Prior efforts tried to control the output of inertial sensors with acoustic signals. However, their approaches did not consider sample rate drifts in analog-to-digital converters as well as many other realistic factors. As a result, few attacks demonstrated effective control over inertial sensors embedded in real systems.This work studies the out-of-band signal injection methods to deliver adversarial control to embedded MEMS inertial sensors and evaluates consequent vulnerabilities exposed in control systems relying on them. Acoustic signals injected into inertial sensors are out-of-band analog signals. Consequently, slight sample rate drifts could be amplified and cause deviations in the frequency of digital signals. Such deviations result in fluctuating sensor output; nevertheless, we characterize two methods to control the output: digital amplitude adjusting and phase pacing. Based on our analysis, we devise non-invasive attacks to manipulate the sensor output as well as the derived inertial information to deceive control systems. We test 25 devices equipped with MEMS inertial sensors and find that 17 of them could be implicitly controlled by our attacks. Furthermore, we investigate the generalizability of our methods and show the possibility to manipulate the digital output through signals with relatively low frequencies in the sensing channel.",

Our system, called BurnBox, provides self-revocable encryption: the user can temporarily disable their access to specific files stored remotely, without revealing which files were revoked during compelled searches, even if the adversary also compromises the cloud storage service. They can later restore access. We formalize the threat model and provide a construction that uses an erasable index, secure erasure of keys, and standard cryptographic tools in order to provide security supported by our formal analysis.

We show that Quack can effectively detect applicationlayer blocking triggered on HTTP and TLS headers, and it is flexible enough to support many other diverse protocols. In experiments, we test for blocking across 4458 autonomous systems, an order of magnitude larger than provided by country probes used by OONI. We also test a corpus of 100,000 keywords from vantage points in 40 countries to produce detailed national blocklists. Finally, we analyze the keywords we find blocked to provide insight into the application-layer blocking ecosystem and compare countries\u2019 behavior. We find that the most consistently blocked services are related to circumvention tools, pornography, and gambling, but that there is significant country-to-country variation.",

Companies and academic communities have responded with a wide range of countermeasures. However , the way these countermeasures are evaluated does not properly assess their impact on user privacy, in particular regarding the quantity of information they may indirectly leak by revealing their presence. In this paper, we investigate the current state of the art of browser fingerprinting countermeasures to study the inconsistencies they may introduce in altered fingerprints , and how this may impact user privacy. To do so, we introduce FP-SCANNER as a new test suite that explores browser fingerprint inconsistencies to detect potential alterations, and we show that we are capable of detecting countermeasures from the inconsistencies they introduce. Beyond spotting altered browser fingerprints, we demonstrate that FP-SCANNER can also reveal the original value of altered fingerprint attributes, such as the browser or the operating system. We believe that this result can be exploited by fingerprinters to more accurately target browsers with countermeasures.",

            "abstract": "Due to the increasing deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in real-world security-critical domains including autonomous vehicles and collision avoidance systems, formally checking security properties of DNNs, especially under different attacker capabilities, is becoming crucial. Most existing security testing techniques for DNNs try to find adversarial examples without providing any formal security guarantees about the non-existence of such adversarial examples. Recently, several projects have used different types of Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers to formally check security properties of DNNs. However, all of these approaches are limited by the high overhead caused by the solver. \nIn this paper, we present a new direction for formally checking security properties of DNNs without using SMT solvers. Instead, we leverage interval arithmetic to compute rigorous bounds on the DNN outputs. Our approach, unlike existing solver-based approaches, is easily parallelizable. We further present symbolic interval analysis along with several other optimizations to minimize overestimations of output bounds. \nWe design, implement, and evaluate our approach as part of ReluVal, a system for formally checking security properties of Relu-based DNNs. Our extensive empirical results show that ReluVal outperforms Reluplex, a state-of-the-art solver-based system, by 200 times on average. On a single 8-core machine without GPUs, within 4 hours, ReluVal is able to verify a security property that Reluplex deemed inconclusive due to timeout after running for more than 5 days. Our experiments demonstrate that symbolic interval analysis is a promising new direction towards rigorously analyzing different security properties of DNNs.",

In this paper, we describe our efforts to understand and experimentally validate such attacks in the context of image recognition. We identify techniques that allow attackers to associate Student models with their Teacher counterparts, and launch highly effective misclassi\ufb01cation attacks on black-box Student models. We validate this on widely used Teacher models in the wild. Finally, we propose and evaluate multiple approaches for defense, including a neuron-distance technique that successfully defends against these attacks while also obfuscates the link between Teacher and Student models.",

            "abstract": "Once a computer system has been infected with malware, restoring it to an uninfected state often requires costly service-interrupting actions such as rolling back to a stable snapshot or reimaging the system entirely. We present CRIU-MR: a technique for restoring an infected server system running within a Linux container to an uninfected state in a service-preserving manner using Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace (CRIU). We modify the CRIU source code to flexibly integrate with existing malware detection technologies so that it can remove suspected malware processes within a Linux container during a checkpoint/restore event. This allows for infected containers with a potentially damaged filesystem to be checkpointed and subsequently restored on a fresh backup filesystem while both removing malware processes and preserving the state of trusted ones. This method can be quickly performed with minimal impact on service availability, restoring active TCP connections and completely removing several types of malware from infected Linux containers.",

            "abstract": "Researchers have observed the increasing commoditization of cybercrime, that is, the offering of capabilities, services, and resources as commodities by specialized suppliers in the underground economy. Commoditization enables outsourcing, thus lowering entry barriers for aspiring criminals, and potentially driving further growth in cybercrime. While there is evidence in the literature of specific examples of cybercrime commoditization, the overall phenomenon is much less understood. Which parts of cybercrime value chains are successfully commoditized, and which are not? What kind of revenue do criminal business-to-business (B2B) services generate and how fast are they growing? We use longitudinal data from eight online anonymous marketplaces over six years, from the original Silk Road to AlphaBay, and track the evolution of commoditization on these markets. We develop a conceptual model of the value chain components for dominant criminal business models. We then identify the market supply for these components over time. We find evidence of commoditization in most components, but the outsourcing options are highly restricted and transaction volume is often modest. Cash-out services feature the most listings and generate the largest revenue. Consistent with behavior observed in the context of narcotic sales, we also find a significant amount of revenue in retail cybercrime, i.e., business-to-consumer (B2C) rather than business to-business. We conservatively estimate the overall revenue for cybercrime commodities on online anonymous markets to be at least US $15M between 2011-2017. While there is growth, commoditization is a spottier phenomenon than previously assumed.",

Countermeasures, however, are \noften incorrectly deployed or completely omitted in practice. \nMoreover, existing tools that identify information leaks in programs either suffer from imprecise abstraction or only cover a subset of possible leaks. We systematically address these limitations and propose a new methodology to test software for information leaks. \nIn this work, we present DATA, a differential address trace analysis framework that detects address-based sidechannel \nleaks in program binaries. This accounts for attacks \nexploiting caches, DRAM, branch prediction, controlled \nchannels, and likewise. DATA works in three phases. First, the program under test is executed to record several address traces. These traces are analyzed using a novel algorithm that dynamically re-aligns traces to increase detection accuracy. Second, a generic leakage test filters differences caused by statistically independent program behavior, e.g., randomization, and reveals true information leaks. The third phase classifies these leaks according to the information that can be obtained from them. This provides further insight to security analysts about the risk they pose in practice. \nWe use DATA to analyze OpenSSL and PyCrypto in \na fully automated way. Among several expected leaks in \nsymmetric ciphers, DATA also reveals known and previously \nunknown leaks in asymmetric primitives (RSA, DSA, ECDSA), and DATA identifies erroneous bug fixes of supposedly fixed constant-time vulnerabilities.",

In contrast to conventional Internet services, onion services are private, generally not indexed by search engines, and use self-certifying domain names that are long and difficult for humans to read. In this paper, we study how people perceive, understand, and use onion services based on data from 17 semi-structured interviews and an online survey of 517 users. We find that users have an incomplete mental model of onion services, use these services for anonymity, and have vary- ing trust in onion services in general. Users also have difficulty discovering and tracking onion sites and authenticating them. Finally, users want technical improvements to onion services and better information on how to use them. Our findings suggest various improvements for the security and usability of Tor onion services, including ways to automatically detect phishing of onion services, clearer security indicators, and better ways to manage onion domain names that are difficult to remember.",

            "abstract": "Obfuscation is used in malware to hide malicious activity from manual or automatic program analysis. On the Android platform, malware has had a history of using obfuscation techniques such as Java reflection, code packing and value encryption. However, more recent malware has turned to employing obfuscation that subverts the integrity of the Android runtime (ART or Dalvik), a technique we call runtime-based obfuscation. Once subverted, the runtime no longer follows the normally expected rules of code execution and method invocation, raising the difficulty of deobfuscating and analyzing malware that use these techniques. In this work, we propose TIRO, a deobfuscation framework for Android using an approach of TargetInstrument-Run-Observe. TIRO provides a unified framework that can deobfuscate malware that use a combination of traditional obfuscation and newer runtimebased obfuscation techniques. We evaluate and use TIRO on a dataset of modern Android malware samples and find that TIRO can automatically detect and reverse language-based and runtime-based obfuscation. We also evaluate TIRO on a corpus of 2000 malware samples from VirusTotal and find that runtime-based obfuscation techniques are present in 80% of the samples, demonstrating that runtime-based obfuscation is a significant tool employed by Android malware authors today.",

            "abstract": "Software vendors usually prioritize their bug remediation based on ease of their exploitation. However, accurately determining exploitability typically takes tremendous hours and requires significant manual efforts. To address this issue, automated exploit generation techniques can be adopted. In practice, they however exhibit an insufficient ability to evaluate exploitability particularly for the kernel Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerabilities. This is mainly because of the complexity of UAF exploitation as well as the scalability of an OS kernel. In this paper, we therefore propose FUZE, a new framework to facilitate the process of kernel UAF exploitation. The design principle behind this technique is that we expect the ease of crafting an exploit could augment a security analyst with the ability to evaluate the exploitability of a kernel UAF vulnerability. Technically, FUZE utilizes kernel fuzzing along with symbolic execution to identify, analyze and evaluate the system calls valuable and useful for kernel UAF exploitation. In addition, it leverages dynamic tracing and an off-the-shelf constraint solver to guide the manipulation of vulnerable object. To demonstrate the utility of FUZE, we implement FUZE on a 64-bit Linux system by extending a binary analysis framework and a kernel fuzzer. Using 15 realworld kernel UAF vulnerabilities on Linux systems, we then demonstrate FUZE could not only escalate kernel UAF exploitability but also diversify working exploits. In addition, we show that FUZE could facilitate security mitigation bypassing, making exploitability evaluation less challenging and more efficient. ?The work was done while studying at Pennsylvania State University. \u2020Key Laboratory of Network Assessment Technology, CAS \u2021Beijing Key Laboratory of Network Security and Protection Technology",

            "abstract": "Recently there has been much academic and industrial interest in practical implementations of zero knowledge proofs. These techniques allow a party to prove to another party that a given statement is true without revealing any additional information. In a Bitcoin-like system, this allows a payer to prove validity of a payment without disclosing the payment\u2019s details. Unfortunately, the existing systems for generating such proofs are very expensive, especially in terms of memory overhead. Worse yet, these systems are \u201cmonolithic\u201d, so they are limited by the memory resources of a single machine. This severely limits their practical applicability. We describe DIZK, a system that distributes the generation of a zero knowledge proof across machines in a compute cluster. Using a set of new techniques, we show that DIZK scales to computations of up to billions of log- ical gates (100\u00d7 larger than prior art) at a cost of 10\u03bcs per gate (100\u00d7 faster than prior art). We then use DIZK to study various security applications.",

            "abstract": "At any given time there exist a large number of software vulnerabilities in our computing systems, but only a fraction of them are ultimately exploited in the wild. Advanced knowledge of which vulnerabilities are being or likely to be exploited would allow system administrators to prioritize patch deployments, enterprises to assess their security risk more precisely, and security companies to develop intrusion protection for those vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present a novel method based on the notion of community detection for early discovery of vulnerability exploits. Specifically, on one hand, we use symptomatic botnet data (in the form of a set of spam blacklists) to discover a community structure which reveals how similar Internet entities behave in terms of their malicious activities. On the other hand, we analyze the risk behavior of end-hosts through a set of patch deployment measurements that allow us to assess their risk to different vulnerabilities. The latter is then compared to the former to quantify whether the underlying risks are consistent with the observed global symptomatic community structure, which then allows us to statistically determine whether a given vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild. Our results show that by observing up to 10 days\u2019 worth of data, we can successfully detect vulnerability exploitation with a true positive rate of 90% and a false positive rate of 10%. Our detection is shown to be much earlier than the standard discovery time records for most vulnerabilities. Experiments also demonstrate that our community based detection algorithm is robust against strategic adversaries.",

Despite its importance, little effort has been devoted to a systematic testing on the implementations of SSO SDKs, especially in the pub-lic domain.

To demonstrate the ef\ufb01cacy of S3KVetter, we apply it to test ten popular SSO SDKs which enjoy millions of downloads by application developers. Among these carefully engineered SDKs, S3KVetter has surprisingly discovered 7 classes of logic \ufb02aws, 4 of which were previously unknown.

The impacts of such threats, however, are less clear, since they are either less stealthy (producing noise-like voice commands) or requiring the physical presence of an attack device (using ultrasound). In this paper, we demonstrate that not only are more practical and surreptitious attacks feasible but they can even be automatically constructed. Specifically, we find that the voice commands can be stealthily embedded into songs, which, when played, can effectively control the target system through ASR without being noticed. For this purpose, we developed novel techniques that address a key technical challenge: integrating the commands into a song in a way that can be effectively recognized by ASR through the air, in the presence of background noise, while not being detected by a human listener. Our research shows that this can be done automatically against real world ASR applications. We also demonstrate that such CommanderSongs can be spread through Internet (e.g., YouTube) and radio, potentially affecting millions of ASR users. We further present a new mitigation technique that controls this threat.",

However, it is often obfuscated by the extensive use of dark jargons , innocently-looking terms like \u201cpopcorn\u201d that serves sinister purposes (buy-ing/selling drug, seeking crimeware, etc.). Discovery and understanding of these jargons have so far relied on manual effort, which is error-prone and cannot catch up with the fast evolving underground ecosystem. In this paper, we present the \ufb01rst technique, called Cantreader , to automatically detect and understand dark jargon. Our approach employs a neural-network based embedding technique to analyze the semantics of words, detecting those whose contexts in legitimate documents are signi\ufb01cantly different from those in underground communication. For this purpose, we enhance the existing word embedding model to support semantic comparison across good and bad corpora, which leads to the detection of dark jargons. To further understand them, our approach utilizes projection learning to identify a jargon\u2019s hypernym that sheds light on its true meaning when used in underground communication. Running Cantreader over one million traces collected from four underground forums, our approach automatically reported 3,462 dark jargons and their hypernyms, including 2,491 never known before. The study further reveals how these jargons are used (by 25% of the traces) and evolve and how they help cybercriminals communicate on legitimate forums.",

            "abstract": "Recently, hybrid fuzzing has been proposed to address the limitations of fuzzing and concolic execution by combining both approaches. The hybrid approach has shown its effectiveness in various synthetic benchmarks such as DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) binaries, but it still suffers from scaling to find bugs in complex, realworld software. We observed that the performance bottleneck of the existing concolic executor is the main limiting factor for its adoption beyond a small-scale study. \n \nTo overcome this problem, we design a fast concolic execution engine, called QSYM, to support hybrid fuzzing. The key idea is to tightly integrate the symbolic emulation with the native execution using dynamic binary translation, making it possible to implement more fine-grained, so faster, instruction-level symbolic emulation. Additionally, QSYM loosens the strict soundness requirements of conventional concolic executors for better performance, yet takes advantage of a faster fuzzer for validation, providing unprecedented opportunities for performance optimizations, e.g., optimistically solving constraints and pruning uninteresting basic blocks. \n \nOur evaluation shows that QSYM does not just outperform state-of-the-art fuzzers (i.e., found 14\u00d7 more bugs than VUzzer in the LAVA-M dataset, and outperformed Driller in 104 binaries out of 126), but also found 13 previously unknown security bugs in eight real-world programs like Dropbox Lepton, ffmpeg, and OpenJPEG, which have already been intensively tested by the state-of-the-art fuzzers, AFL and OSS-Fuzz.",

            "abstract": "Mobile navigation services are used by billions of users around globe today. While GPS spoofing is a known threat, it is not yet clear if spoofing attacks can truly manipulate road navigation systems. Existing works primarily focus on simple attacks by randomly setting user locations, which can easily trigger a routing instruction that contradicts with the physical road condition (i.e., easily noticeable). \n \nIn this paper, we explore the feasibility of a stealthy manipulation attack against road navigation systems. The goal is to trigger the fake turn-by-turn navigation to guide the victim to a wrong destination without being noticed. Our key idea is to slightly shift the GPS location so that the fake navigation route matches the shape of the actual roads and trigger physically possible instructions. To demonstrate the feasibility, we first perform controlled measurements by implementing a portable GPS spoofer and testing on real cars. Then, we design a searching algorithm to compute the GPS shift and the victim routes in real time. We perform extensive evaluations using a trace-driven simulation (600 taxi traces in Manhattan and Boston), and then validate the complete attack via real-world driving tests (attacking our own car). Finally, we conduct deceptive user studies using a driving simulator in both the US and China. We show that 95% of the participants follow the navigation to the wrong destination without recognizing the attack. We use the results to discuss countermeasures moving forward.",

It is critical to ensure that patches are propagated to all affected software timely, which, unfortunately, is often not the case. Thus the capability to accurately test the security patch presence in software distributions is crucial, for both defenders and attackers. Inspired by human analysts\u2019 behaviors to inspect only small and localized code areas, we present FIBER, an automated system that leverages this observation in its core design. FIBER works by first parsing and analyzing the open-source security patches carefully and then generating fine-grained binary signatures that faithfully reflect the most representative syntax and semantic changes introduced by the patch, which are used to search against target binaries. Compared to previous work, FIBER leverages the source-level insight strategically by primarily focusing on small changes of patches and minimal contexts, instead of the whole function or file. We have systematically evaluated FIBER using 107 real-world security patches and 8 Android kernel images from 3 different mainstream vendors, the results show that FIBER can achieve an average accuracy of 94% with no false positives.",

            "abstract": "Mobile apps have become the main channel for accessing Web services. Both Android and iOS feature inapp Web browsers that support convenient Web service integration through a set of Web resource manipulation APIs. Previous work have revealed the attack surfaces of Web resource manipulation APIs and proposed several defense mechanisms. However, none of them provides evidence that such attacks indeed happen in the real world, measures their impacts, and evaluates the proposed defensive techniques against real attacks. This paper seeks to bridge this gap with a large-scale empirical study on Web resource manipulation behaviors in real-world Android apps. To this end, we first define the problem as cross-principal manipulation (XPM) of Web resources, and then design an automated tool named XPMChecker to detect XPM behaviors in apps. Through a study on 80,694 apps from Google Play, we find that 49.2% of manipulation cases are XPM, 4.8% of the apps have XPM behaviors, and more than 70% XPM behaviors aim at top Web sites. More alarmingly, we discover 21 apps with obvious malicious intents, such as stealing and abusing cookies, collecting user credentials and impersonating legitimate parties. For the first time, we show the presence of XPM threats in real-world apps. We also confirm the existence of such threats in iOS apps. Our experiments show that popular Web service providers are largely unaware of such threats.

            "abstract": "Interacting with Ethereum smart contracts can have potentially devastating financial consequences. In light of this, several regulatory bodies have called for a need to audit smart contracts for security and correctness guarantees. Unfortunately, auditing smart contracts that do not have readily available source code can be challenging, and there are currently few tools available that aid in this process. Such contracts remain opaque to auditors. To address this, we present Erays, a reverse engineering tool for smart contracts. Erays takes in smart contract from the Ethereum blockchain, and produces high-level pseudocode suitable for manual analysis. We show how Erays can be used to provide insight into several contract properties, such as code complexity and code reuse in the ecosystem. We then leverage Erays to link contracts with no previously available source code to public source code, thus reducing the overall opacity in the ecosystem. Finally, we demonstrate how Erays can be used for reverse-engineering in four case studies: high-value multisignature wallets, arbitrage bots, exchange accounts, and finally, a popular smart-contract game, Cryptokitties. We conclude with a discussion regarding the value of reverse engineering in the smart contract ecosystem, and how Erays can be leveraged to address the challenges that lie ahead.",
